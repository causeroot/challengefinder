traveled in there are theories to explain the source of the improvement including effects of the economic downturn manufacturers creating vehicles success of safety campaigns such as those against driving and distracted driving higher rates of seatbelt use engineering improvements to roads and a sample visualization topic could be to examine through visualization the impacts of one or more of the above sources improving the safety measure of rates of fatalities per vehicle miles traveled between and the data visualization topic could also focus on local issues example drawing from local data sources how have improvements on intersection corridor or bus route helped to improve safety if improvements have yet to be made can the safety incident data presented in a way that points to what countermeasures can be taken improve possible data the national highway traffic safety fatality analysis reporting system fars httpaddr us census database httpaddr state and local department of

tarmac time has a possible side effect of the rule has been an increase in cancellations resulting in individuals potentially being an investment example of possible unintended consequences of is the case where a new runway added at a runway airport may anticipated to add percent to the overall airport capacity but to added operational complexity a lower level of capacity is there is a broad range of aviation data available for application data visualization in addition to the above examples sample could explore the relationship between airline performance airport capacity utilization across the country this can examine by time of day what is the relationship between individual flight delays passenger delay due to late arrivals and missed what is the effect of weather and the seasons on

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize this page wikipedia en copyright wikipedia from wikipedia the free jump to navigation the netflix prize was an open competition for the best filtering algorithm to predict user ratings for films based previous ratings without any other information about the users films ie without the users or the films being identified except numbers assigned for the the competition was held by netflix an online service and was open to anyone not connected with netflix current former employees agents close relatives of netflix employees or a resident of cuba iran syria north myanmar or sudan on september the grand prize was given to the pragmatic chaos team bested own algorithm for predicting ratings problem and data progress over the progress progress cancelled privacy see external problem and data netflix provided a training data set of ratings users gave to movies each training rating is quadruplet of the form user movie date of grade user and movie fields are integer ids while grades are from to integral the qualifying data set contains over triplets of form user movie date of grade with grades known only to the a participating algorithm must predict grades on the qualifying set but they are only informed of the score for half of data the quiz set of ratings the other half is the test of and performance on this is used by the jury to potential prize winners only the judges know which ratings are in quiz set and which are in the test arrangement is to make it difficult to hill climb on the test set predictions are scored against the true grades in terms of mean squared error rmse and the goal is to reduce this error as as possible note that while the actual grades are integers in range to submitted predictions need not be netflix identified a probe subset of ratings within the training set the probe quiz and test data sets were chosen to have statistical in summary the data used in the netflix prize looks as training set probe set qualifying set ratings consisting test set ratings used to determine quiz set ratings used to calculate for each movie title and year of release are provided in a dataset no information at all is provided about users in order protect the privacy of customers some of the rating data for customers in the training and qualifying sets have been perturbed in one or more of the following ways deleting inserting alternative ratings and dates and modifying the training set is such that the average user rated over and the average movie was rated by over users but there is variance in the movies in the training set have as as ratings while one user rated over there was some controversy as to the choice of rmse as the metric would a reduction of the rmse by really benefit the it has been claimed that even as small an improvement as results in a significant difference in the ranking of the top recommended movies for a prizes were based on improvement over own algorithm cinematch or the previous score if a team has made beyond a certain threshold a trivial algorithm that predicts for movie in the quiz set its average grade from the training data an rmse of cinematch uses

currently held by team edison team motors team official website the progressive insurance automotive x prize piaxp or axp was a of competitions programs and events from the x prize to inspire a new generation of vehicles that break addiction to oil and stem the effects of change progressive insurance was the title sponsor of prize the centerpiece of which is the competition division which a million dollar purse was divided between the winners three the essence of each competition is to design build and vehicles that achieve kilometer efficiency produce less than co equivalent emissions and could be for the mass market within the competition division there two vehicle classes mainstream and alternative the mainstream has a prize of million the alternate class has two separate of million one for seating and one for the piaxp has an educational program funded by a million from the united states department of energy to engage students the public in learning about advanced vehicle technologies efficiency climate change alternative fuels and the technology engineering and math behind efficient the winners of the competition were announced on team edison won the million mainstream competition with very light car obtaining mpge on e team motors won the million alternative competition with their aerodynamic electric achieving team switzerland won the million alternative competition with their mpge faired electric vehicle competition design shakedown knockout finals validation educational competing alternative side by alternative see external the x prize foundation began work on the development of a to spur innovation in the automotive industry in and on announced that mark goodstein would join the foundation as executive director of the new prize a little more than later on april the foundation formally announced the of the prize at the new york auto show and set the purse at million for a car that could get and be sold for a reasonable price in subsequent year the x prize foundation solidified sponsorship for prize and on march announced that progressive insurance be the title sponsor of the prize and fund the million purse that point onward it was known as the progressive insurance x prize at the april announcement of the creation of the x prize foundation released draft competition guidelines which were open public comment from april to may the latest guidelines published on january the competition guidelines are product of hundreds of volunteers of the axp and on april the x prize foundation announced that had registered by the february deadline by the design judging had winnowed the number of teams down to with some publicly and others quietly withdrawing formal vehicle competition events began on april and of the remaining four stages shakedown april may knockout june finals july and august vehicle within the competition division there are two and of which have the requirements for fuel economy and emissions but design constraints the alternative class is further divided tandem and classes vehicles in the mainstream class meet specifications that are derived from typical economy vehicles the alternative class fewer performance and design restrictions and provides an outlet innovation both classes allow entries that are modifications of existing popular vehicle provided that all piaxp requirements are vehicles in both classes must have a fuel economy of kwh or liters of kilometer and produce less co emissions measured for vehicles the co emissions requirement is a more binding because co emissions will be calculated assuming a national of electricity sources projected to an car will to achieve mpge in order to produce less than emissions further electricity consumption is measured at the side of the battery charging device so it would have to achieve mpge assuming efficient battery charging if the charger were efficient this requirement would grow to in the other words efficiency of electric cars should be not but vehicles in both classes also must have features expected of a automobile including an enclosed cabin with windshield and operating windshield wipers washers headlights horn brake lights reflective devices rear and mirrors and belts they must have the usual automotive controls accelerator pedal brake pedal steering mechanism not necessarily wheel and indicators they must be highway capable which is as the ability to maintain mph on a four percent grade and to accelerate from mph to mph less than seconds they must be able to brake from to mph less than feet m meet

applicable highway traffic safety administration nhtsa requirements compliance has to be designed for example allowance for in the designs is considered acceptable without actually installing airbags teams are also required to submit a business which clearly demonstrates an ability to produce vehicles year note that teams are not required to be this but the plan has to exist and the car has to be designed such that plan is with the lack of mainstream entrants from established companies a demonstration division was created so that could at least display and promote their highest efficiency alongside the main competition however there were too few entrants march registration deadline and this division was the only confirmed entrant was the tesla roadster which dropped out of the main vehicles in the demonstration division would have met the requirements as mainstream class vehicles in the competition except for mpge and co emissions there was no alternative equivalent in the demonstration division these vehicles would been stock vehicles ie vehicles identical to those for sale prototypes of vehicles intended for vehicles in the demonstration division would have been tested in same way as competition division vehicles and would have in the piaxp competition events under the same rules in order demonstrate and showcase their capabilities and competition the competition timeline was finalized as design accepted teams must provide evidence that their vehicles are capable by providing a detailed data submissions covering four safety and emissions vehicles must be designed so that production they meet us safety standards fmvss and emission manufacturability and cost vehicles must be capable of manufactured in quantities of per year with production within levels consistent with that production features vehicles must have the features expected by consumers vehicles within the projected prices business plan there must be a credible plan to

publisher science alan kotok is editor and publisher of science httpaddr a news blog on scientific in the marketplace founded in july mr kotok retired in as the managing editor of science careers a unit of magazine full more foundations government agencies and private companies holding innovation challenges that offer rich purses to generate ideas to solve tough problems from a wide range of sources these competitions can return plenty of dazzling ideas but they still to fit into an overall research and development the offer of million in prizes to encourage scientists and entrepreneurs to devise new ways of cleaning up ocean oil announced last week highlights the growing use of innovation to find breakthrough solutions for chronic technological and problems while these contests and prizes are not a new their use is increasing with more foundations government and private companies now using them to generate new ideas from a range of more often than not innovation challenges involve a rich purse which teams or individuals compete with their notions of solutions the big prizes often running into hundreds of thousands millions of dollars are designed to get people with ideas about problems to put aside incremental advances and think creatively the matter ie start fresh or attack the problem from a angle the big purse also helps draw attention of the media and to the issues behind the the practice of offering prizes for innovations is hardly new a known historical example is the orteig prize a offered by hotel magnate raymond orteig to the first person to nonstop from new york to paris and won most famously by lindbergh in while lindbergh himself captured the imagination at the time it was his simple approach flying a engine aircraft with only the pilot on board that enabled him leapfrog the competition of larger and more complex undertakings make the first transatlantic the emergence of crowdsourcing the practice of opening up problems issues to the public at large is another reason innovation have become more popular benefactors putting up prize money often answers from outside the normal communities of experts to get new ideas to solve the problems at hand even if it means getting or even downright goofy lower the barriers widen the the x prize foundation the group running the ocean oil cleanup challenge is a pioneer in the modern incarnation of technique in the foundation awarded the ansari x prize a million purse to scaled composites llc for its privately spacecraft that twice carried a crew of three to altitudes of kilometers above the surface from that beginning the x foundation has gone on to offer a million prize for lunar space travel sponsored by a million competition to build a production capable car gets miles per a million prize for better cheaper and faster ways to genomes that can lead to personalized another pioneer in innovation challenges is the bill and melinda foundation which offers its grand challenges in global unlike the x prizes that have one or at most a few winners the challenges award a series of grants for breakthrough aimed alleviating major global health issues but even this program spun off a new initiative called grand challenges aimed at lowering the barriers to truly creative ideas from student through tenured faculty this requires only a two page application uses accelerated review processes with awards of to several federal agencies make use of innovation challenges of defense advanced research projects agency darpa and nasa are trail blazers darpa has run three such challenges since most recent in to build an autonomous vehicle that can drive urban traffic performing maneuvers such as merging passing and negotiating intersections nasa has run challenges since with three more challenges and million prizes added in july in march the office of management and budget omb agencies to make more use of innovation challenges an omb memo departments and agencies spelled out the legal and grant authority for holding competitions who were also urged to with outside organizations for their design and private companies are also getting into the act in july electric ge and four venture capital companies teamed up to million for innovative ideas on building the next generation grid some will be given in awards for submissions superior entrepreneurship and innovation but the big money is for the submitted ideas ge and the venture capital companies are worth developing and the real work of goes while innovation challenges can grab headlines and generate ideas the work of research and development goes an operation normally entails steady progress rather than grand slam breakthroughs building on a known of work and often taking into account regulatory requirements such health and safety and while many of the innovation challenge prizes are generous are dwarfed by the ongoing spending of business and government national science foundation estimates that in the last year which data are available american companies spent some billion on worldwide with billion of that spent in the for the federal government long considered the funding for basic research in the fiscal year that begins on federal agencies are requesting nearly billion for this scale of private and government spending on is innovation today but largely in the traditional incremental the task for companies and agencies is to combine the energy creativity of innovation challenges with the work of the ongoing enterprise no formula for putting together the two but some organizations have initiatives that try to capture least the spirit of innovation challenges these programs open the to different ideas or methods from sources other than the suspects while the mainstream programs national institutes of health nih the largest government funder biomedical research reserves part of its grant portfolio for what calls its high risk research program to encourage ideas investigators that break away from the normal paradigms two of three opportunities under this program the pioneer and new awards support individual researchers with unusual or creative rather than research projects a sharp break from normal way doing business the third opportunity called transformative r r the designation for main funding vehicle supports projects those projects with a genuinely creative or novel national science foundation offers a program called for innovation pfi that tries to inject the entrepreneurial spirit small business into the research enterprise to create a different for spurring innovation purpose is to develop new ways generating innovative ideas not just the ideas pfi brings entrepreneurs together with researchers to researchers more agile in adapting their research for use in applications and to increase the potential viability of existing businesses to leverage this capacity teams competing for pfi must contain and be led by at least two small businesses working with university or research institute although large companies may join in the private sector ge has created a program called hunts that encourages its staff to find ways of reducing the energy costs ge says its internal treasure hunts have so identified some million in potential savings each treasure team is made up of ge staff but also outside experts which identify projects to improve efficiency or cut waste ge has partnered with the environmental defense fund to take the treasure idea outside the company to help other companies communities

college education have remained in the middle class moved up those without any college have languished with stagnant or fallen into poverty despite these trends supply has not kept with demand labor economists at georgetown university project that the us will face a shortfall of at least million workers college degrees associate or higher and at least million with postsecondary political and education leaders increasingly are calling for concerted focus on student success in community colleges and across the postsecondary president obama articulated a national goal for the us to regain the international lead postsecondary education by and leading national foundations nonprofit organizations have embraced similar goals clearly colleges will have to play a major role if america is to boost educational attainment more than students youth adult learners enroll in nearly community every but efforts to increase completion rates are stymied by obstacles one is a widespread sense that community colleges are institutions existing data on community performance do paint a bleak picture overall according to data from the us department of education fewer than four out every ten community college students completes any type of degree certificate after six years while some students credentials or degrees the overwhelming majority of students are and such massive leakage in the education pipeline imperils economic future underneath the averages community colleges surely exist but are not recognized for a second challenge the lack of generally accepted measures of success in the community college sector impedes meaningful and comparative analysis of success this relates to a third without clear measures of success it is hard for community colleges benchmark against one another analyze what field leaders are and emulate the practices of those who are succeeding with students as a result the accomplishments of the best colleges go unnoticed and colleges have few incentives or roadmaps for a national prize competition for community colleges will help lift the best community colleges and galvanize nascent efforts to completion rates and improve employment

look at performance of all community colleges around the country on the metrics because the eligibility criteria take into account change time colleges that have made significant gains in student outcomes these metrics over the past two years may rise into the top year or in subsequent return to why are certain community colleges with national reputations innovation not on the list of eligible the eligibility bar for the aspen prize was intentionally set requiring strong student outcomes considering several factors graduation and retention rates improvement in graduation rates time and success with minority and students community colleges are doing important work to improve student in one or more of these areas but only those with the aggregate levels of success considering these factors were eligible for the return to are institutions represented on the list of eligible community yes there are six hispanic serving institutions and one tribal on the list of eligible institutions in addition as part of eligibility criteria all institutions were assessed based on success in ensuring equity in student achievement the process deliberately and explicitly took into account diversity and equity in outcomes for students from minority return to is accreditation standing taken into consideration in order to yes to be eligible for selection as a finalist for or winner of aspen prize institutions must have return to how does the methodology for selecting eligible institutions for the fact that the ipeds graduation rate does not include the aspen institute with technical support from the national for higher education management systems nchems and guidance from advisory panel has designed the prize selection to incorporate a broad and comprehensive range of criteria the selection of leading national community colleges relies on available ipeds data that do not include students we also looked at a variety of other metrics including the portion underrepresented students and students served by institutions as well as the total number of awarded relative to the total enrollment taking into account students as well as students we have attempted as best possible using publicly available ipeds data to assess excellence outcomes with a comprehensive set of data points that look beyond graduation rates and take into account the varied missions populations served by community return to for round eligibility why did change over time focus on the count credentials per fte but not to calculate change over time data must be consistent particularly for small institutions graduation retention rates in ipeds fluctuate too much from to used to calculate improvement return to why remedial education success one of the metrics there are no nationally available data to measure success with entering community college with remedial needs however success students who test into education will considered in determining finalists and the

developers and gathered last week at the iac building in lower manhattan to honor winners of the new york city bigapps the city of new york opened data sets from agencies to developers and offered the carrot of in prizes in the hopes spurring technological innovation the judges for the included mahalo ceo jason calacanis kevin ryan chairman of groupe and fred wilson of union square ventures among a hugely successful economic brandon kessler says of competition the ceo of challengepost the company that organized competition for the city calculates that take the average amount spent on an app by a government agency and talking minimum of per app so at apps million worth innovation created in exchange for in prize but it was more than the pecuniary reward that piqued the interest teams that submitted apps only of which were eligible are motivated not just by money but by status and recognition altruism and the competitive spirit and intellectual the app makers retain their intellectual property but they must their submissions available for free for a year after the though they are encouraged to create premium versions asked if any the apps had a bright commercial future calacanis responded considering reaching out to some of these for investment so the grand prize went to wayfinder nyc which utilizes augmented to help users locate the nearest transit options second prize went

http://www.wifcon.com/anal/analcomproc.htm home contents discussions blog search search httpaddr search httpaddr processes in government contracting the far part and process by vernon j april boiled down to its essence choosing a contractor in a acquisition is a matter of information processing the collects information about alternative choices competing assesses each alternative on the basis of specified evaluation factors and then compares each alternative to the on the basis of those assessments in order to rank them and which is best the process is essentially the same no matter method of contracting is used ordering against a gsa multiple schedule simplified acquisition sealed bidding negotiation or opportunity under a multiple award delivery or task order when planning a competitive acquisition agency acquisition must design a process for getting information about the assessing each alternative and comparing the alternatives in order determine which is best in developing their process they must into account their objectives for process quality schedule and they must consider the attributes of a good decision the available to make it and the human and technological resources computers and decision support software at their disposal they want to minimize their transaction costs by making the decision they can in the shortest reasonable time and using no more their resources than absolutely necessary they also want to economize on the demands made on the competing firms so as not make government business unattractive to the best firms by it too costly and a review of protest decisions by the us general accounting gao and the literature on government contracting suggests that agencies fail to design efficient competitive processes because follow a poor process model that model has evolved over the course years in connection with source selections conducted under acquisition regulation far part contracting by negotiation its predecessors i shall refer to this model as the far part process the far part process the far has never prescribed a process for conducting source selection instead it has prescribed rules governing the of source selection processes the current rules in the far organizing for source selection preparing and requests for proposals and amendments thereto and exchanging information prospective and actual offerors and submitting receiving handling modifying and revising proposals and evaluating proposals and making selection decision far expressly states that describes only some of the processes and techniques that agencies use to conduct a source nevertheless by the end of the s a model process had within the federal procurement bureaucracy that has been passed down succeeding generations of acquisition personnel through word of training and classroom instruction the main steps that process model are set forth in table agency issues a request for proposals that solicits proposals from all agency receives competing agency convenes a panel or set of panels to evaluate the panels evaluate all proposals on the basis of the complete set evaluation factors for panels report their findings to the decisionmaker in decisionmaker either a selects the contractor or b establishes competitive range that includes all of the most highly agency negotiates conducts discussions with the agency asks remaining competitors to submit final proposal agency receives final proposal agency convenes panels to evaluate final proposal panels evaluate all final proposal panels report their findings to the decisionmaker in decisionmaker selects the decisionmaker announces the award table the far part process this process model has two key characteristics every competitor required to submit a complete proposal at the outset of the which addresses all of the evaluation factors for award and agency conducts negotiations with more than one firm the of these two characteristics lies in the effect that they have on amount of information that a competitor must prepare and submit that an agency must process in order to make a source decision and on the time and resources required to prepare and that soliciting complete proposals from all competitors the first characteristic of the far part process model is that all must submit complete proposals at the outset of the suppose that an agency plans to select the contractor on the basis a technical approach b management plan c experience d performance e small small disadvantaged and businesses subcontracting plan and f price under the far part process model the agency will require all the competitors to information pertinent to all of those factors at the outset it require every competitor to submit a technical proposal management proposal information about its experience information about its past performance its plan for small disadvantaged and small business subcontracting and prices and supporting price information as a consequence of approach the evaluation panel must assess every competitor on basis of all of that as a general rule the more information that an evaluation panel process the more time personnel that it will need in order process it and the more information that the decisionmaker will to consider when he or she compares the competitors to determine is best it is generally not too difficult to process complete information received from two to five competitors depending on amount of information solicited and this approach saves time by complete proposals ready at hand for the evaluators at the outset the competition and avoiding the need to pause while successive submissions but it can be a challenge to process information from ten competitors and the challenge can be great an agency receives proposals from or more competitors in cases the challenge can even be overwhelming thus in at least cases the process would be more efficient if agencies limited amount of information that the competitors must submit initially thus the amount of information that the evaluators must process and decisionmaker must consider so long as the limitations are with good decisionmaking practices one way to do that is to limit number of evaluation factors another way to do it is to apply evaluation factors in phases in order to progressively narrow competitive field asking the competitors in each phase to submit the information needed in that phase in this way an agency initially ask for limited information eliminate some competitors that basis and carry fewer competitors into subsequent phases in more detailed and voluminous information is obtained and this type of phased evaluation process is sometimes referred to downselect or negotiations with multiple competitors another source of processing costs is conducting negotiations discussions with than one firm although the far permits agencies to award contracts the basis of initial offers without negotiations agencies sometimes establish a competitive range consisting of than one competitor negotiate with them all and then competitive final proposal revisions from them the panel must then evaluate those revisions and report their to the far states that when establishing a competitive range agency must include all of the most highly rated proposals the proposals included in the competitive range the more information the agency will have to process and the more time and resources will used in the source selection process in the explanatory statement accompanied the federal register publication of the far part rewrite the far council we also note that comments received from government indicate that award is nearly always made to one of the three highly rated offerors in the competitive range the incidence award to an offeror other than one of the three such proposals is small that it does not support keeping any business particularly small business with limited bid and proposal resources in competition that the business has virtually no chance far states that in the interests of efficiency may include fewer than all of the most highly rated proposals in competitive range if they include a notice of that possibility in rfp agencies may also establish a competitive range that includes one offeror historically the gao has been skeptical when agency has established a competitive range consisting of only offeror and has said that it will subject such decisions to scrutiny if it receives a protest in that regard however there evidence that it has backed away from that stance since the far part rewrite took effect on january in sum the provide plenty of latitude to keep the number in the competitive small it seems that there is little reason to include more than in most aside from the information processing costs associated with with more than one competitor there is some evidence that with more than one firm during a source selection does not produce true meeting of the minds a government rfp is a very business document an rfp for a item contract in excess of routinely contains more than far clauses and many specifications and statements of work are written competitors must often read rfps and prepare their in haste and without an opportunity to sit down with government to go through the rfp to ensure a common understanding the terms in order to reach a true meeting of the the parties should fully discuss all terms and conditions in an to ensure that they understand them in the same however contracting officers have long been cautious to the point being when negotiating with more than one firm largely to concerns about fairness and improper disclosure of information but perhaps also due to the pressures of time the of board and court decisions suggests that when conducting procurements agencies do not always discuss the specification statement of work and the contract clauses in sufficient detail reach a true meeting of the minds negotiations are too often to deficiencies and weaknesses in proposals apparently based the assumption that the parties share a common understanding of terms and conditions all too often it is only after contract that the parties learn that they have different ideas about respective rights and obligations thus competitive are sometimes ineffective in producing a meeting of the minds the far permits negotiations between the government and successful competitor after selection but before award negotiations are not contemplated in the far part process model there is little evidence that agencies make much use of that to ensure that the parties really agree on the contract the far part process model in having considered the two key characteristics of the far part process model solicitation of complete proposals from every at the outset of the competition and negotiation with competitors i will now consider three examples of the model action in which it has resulted in competitive process i will describe its application to a source selection under far to a gsa multiple award schedule and to an acquisition under far part simplified acquisition procedures i will discuss its application when providing contractors under multiple task order contracts a fair opportunity to be competitive negotiation source selection under far part the case of the department of procurement for the of governmentwide acquisition contracts for its commerce technology solutions program that procurement was subject of a protest that was sustained by the us general office the solicitation described only evaluation factors past performance team composition and price past performance was comprised of two subfactors a and b past performance management competitors were to present some of the information about the subfactor past performance management described as the tools techniques used in previous work and the results obtained in oral presentation the rfp stated that the agency intended give each competitor an opportunity to make an oral the agency was surprised to receive more than proposals and so decided to narrow the field by eliminating some on the basis of competitiveness here is how the gao described the winnowing in performing this review the sseb chairs assigned letter from to c under the two past performance subfactors and a or under the team composition factor agency report a memorandum for ssa concerning clarification and streamlining proposal evaluation guide and processes may narrative explanations for these ratings were prepared as originally contemplated by the proposal evaluation guide comments at an initial screening matrix prepared for each functional area that ranked offerors according their relative ratings under the qrc subfactor this document noted each rating under the ppm subfactor and composition factor and each average loaded hourly rate hearing exh initial screening evaluation the officer reviewed the average loaded labor rates realism and reasonableness all of the average rates determined to be reasonable declaration of contracting oct at comments at for each functional area the sseb chairs recommended based upon the qrc subfactor ratings a that provide for a sufficient competition agency exh source selection report as an example for the functional area the agency received proposals and were rated as or better under the qrc hearing exh initial screening evaluation the sseb chairs briefed the two who were acting jointly concerning the results of the screening and recommended to the ssas that only those offerors received a or higher under the qrc subfactor be permitted to an oral presentation although the sseb chairs informed the ssas the significance of the letter ratings there was no discussion the specifics underlying each rating hearing testimony sseb the ssas agreed with the recommendations no documentation was prepared memorializing the of or decision to limit the competition to those offers that highest rated under the qrc subfactor id price was not in determining which offerors would be invited to make an presentation id declaration of contracting officer oct at declaration of sseb oct at and proposals under the ise area received b under the qrc subfactor and on that basis the protesters were invited to make oral footnotes omitted the agency apparently applied this process to than kathpal and computer management protested that by using procedure to eliminate them the agency had violated the terms of rfp because they had not been permitted to make oral presentations promised the gao sustained the protest on the grounds that a agency did not really evaluate price which must be evaluated in source selection and b the agency did not let the protesters oral presentations which it had promised it would do the gao that the agency could have amended the rfp to permit phased and progressive narrowing of the field of once it realized how many firms were interested in competing agency could have elected to amend the solicitation to eliminate oral presentation and perhaps even one of the evaluation factors subfactors from the initial thus agencies may evaluate proposals in phases and had the agency this case planned for a phased evaluation and described that process its rfp or provided in the rfp for phased evaluation as a procedure its process would have been more efficient and there not have been a protest or the protest would have been two hundred proposals is of course an unusually large number even if the number is only a phased process that quickly reduces the number to between three and five be more efficient than the far part process model and save time resources for both the government and some of the competitors in cases the number could almost certainly be reduced simply by prices before considering any other factors and eliminating whose prices are too it stands to reason that if agencies can economize on their information processing costs by evaluating competitors in phases progressively narrowing the field then they can economize bid and proposal costs by soliciting proposal in phases asking for detailed and voluminous information only those competitors who survive the early phases of the process in an acquisition in which an agency anticipates receiving large number of proposals phased solicitation and evaluation make for a more efficient less and more competitive orders against gsa schedules whatever the advantages and of the far part process model it is understandable that follow it when conducting source selections under far part what remarkable and more difficult to understand is why they follow it when the rules in far part do not apply eg selecting a contractor for placement of an order against a gsa award schedule and when conducting simplified in the past few years the gao has decided several protests in agencies followed the far part process model when using gsa award schedules far prescribes procedures placing orders against gsa schedules in excess of the threshold but within the maximum order threshold need only review catalogs or pricelists of at least three contractors and select the one that they think represents the value at its website the gsa prescribes special procedures ordering services that require a statement of work procedures are as a when ordering services ordering offices prepare a request request for quote or other i a statement of work a statement of work preferred that outlines at a minimum the work to be location of work period of performance deliverable applicable standards acceptance criteria and any requirements ie security clearances travel special etc should be ii the request should include the statement of work and the contractors to submit either a price or a price to provide the services outlined in the statement of work price order shall be requested unless the office makes a determination that it is not possible at the time placing the order to estimate accurately the extent or duration the work or to anticipate cost with any reasonable degree confidence when such a determination is made a labor hour quote may be requested the shall be based on the prices in the schedule contract and consider the mix of labor categories and level of effort required perform the services described in the statement of work price of the order should also include any travel or other direct charges related to performance of the ordered unless the order provides for reimbursement of travel at the rates provided in the federal travel or joint regulations a ceiling price must be established for iii the request may ask the contractors if necessary appropriate to submit a project plan for performing the task information on the experience past performing similar iv the request shall notify the contractors what basis will used for selecting the contractor to receive the order the shall include the basis for determining whether the contractors technically qualified and provide an explanation regarding intended use of any experience past performance in determining technical qualification of transmit the request to contractors based upon an evaluation of catalogs and price lists the ordering office identify the contractors that appear to offer the best considering the scope of services offered pricing and factors such as locations as appropriate and the request as i the request shall be provided to at least three if the proposed order is estimated to exceed the threshold but not exceed the maximum order ii for proposed orders exceeding the maximum order threshold request shall be provided to an appropriate number of contractors that offer services that will meet the iii in addition the request shall be provided to any who specifically requests a copy of the request for the iv ordering offices should strive to minimize the costs associated with responding to requests for quotes for orders requests should be tailored to the minimum level for adequate evaluation and selection for order placement presentations should be considered when evaluate responses and select the contractor to receive order after responses have been evaluated against the identified in the request the order should be placed with schedule contractor that represents the best value see far those procedures do not require issuance of the rfq to all contractors the establishment of a competitive range or with all offerors within the competitive range rules in far part which are not applicable to the selection of a contractor under a multiple award schedule yet we know that agencies have followed the far part process model even when far part did apply to the in its decision in the matter of inc the describes a procurement in which the immigration and service ins sought to award a blanket purchase agreement for mail and records management services against multiple schedule for document management services and products agency issued a request for quotations on june the asked quoters to submit extensive technical and price information gao describes the scheme as offerors were required to submit separate technical and proposals for evaluation by a technical evaluation committee and a business evaluation committee bec respectively were to clearly demonstrate the understanding of overall and specific requirements of the proposed bpa and proposal in which material information requested was not or where indirect or incomplete answers or information were might be considered unacceptable rfq offerors were to submit both hard and electronic copies of their proposals rfp award was to be made to the offeror whose proposal represented best value to the government based on three evaluation technical approach past performance and price the approach and past performance factors were equally weighted and two combined were significantly more important than price rfq of the two equally important technical approach estimating model and management only the former is at issue offerors were required to submit an estimating model that stated underlying assumptions and constraints of their method accomplishing the work under orders issued against the bpa the statistical basis for their estimates and explain how derived their technical approach from the analysis of the sow multiple years of workload data supplied by ins offerors required to explain illustrate and explicate their model how the workload associated with each of the many forms under the program built to a model for the technical approach operating each service center and the direct mail program as whole failure to do so was to be taken as a lack of of the technical requirement and a deficient technical approach the rfq listed specific criteria under which ins to evaluate this estimating model to assess the to provide the required services rfq under one offerors were required to show how using the ins estimates forecasted demand and their own allocation and employment of assets using available data would result in an workforce under another criterion offerors were required explain their methods and rationale for allocating labor among functional areas such as filing mailroom operations and entry given the forecasted demand id estimates forecasted demand were based upon the historical data amendment no at question and answer nos pricing tables rfq attach reports c offerors were required to submit price proposals that included sections relevant to this protest first offerors were to an explanation of pricing that described all assumptions made constraints affecting price as well as the price methodology second offerors were to complete electronic tables in accordance with specific instructions these tables which were to serve as the mechanism by which ins under the bpa were built upon estimates forecasted demand third offerors were to provide a priced of the estimating model developed in their technical proposals models submitted for both the technical and price proposals required to be the same except that the model submitted for technical proposal could not contain any labor rates or offerors were required to electronically link the estimating model to the pricing tables in a manner that would ins to see how their proposed price was determined rfq price was to be evaluated for price reasonableness and cost as well as total evaluated price ins was to conduct its analysis using one or more of the techniques specified in acquisition regulation far and its cost analysis in accordance with far ins might also any proposal that was unreasonable or materially unbalanced as prices for basic and year quantities the rfq defined unbalanced proposal as one that incorporated prices less than cost for some items prices that are overstated for other items rfq the agency established an evaluation board which included a selection advisory council a technical evaluation panel and business evaluation committee it received four proposals on august completed the initial evaluations on august established competitive range conducted discussions with three offerors received final proposal revisions on october it then another offeror and reopened discussions with the remaining two amended the rfq and received another round of final proposal on november it awarded the bpa an ordering agreement not order against the gsa schedule contract on january six after it had issued its rfq the loser protested and the gao denied protest on april the protest decision is pages in deciding the protest the gao made the following as a preliminary matter the rfq stated that ins intended to issue bpa against the gsa fss contract accordingly provisions of far subpart apply here

competition already been obtained it was just a matter of choosing among the contractors why not instead just issue a statement work ask for quotes and experience and past performance pick a contractor and then negotiate the terms of the bpa including final pricing formulas one can find several cases among the decisions of the simplified acquisitions some agencies follow the far part model even when conducting simplified acquisitions agencies can the simplified acquisition procedures described in far part to contracts valued at up to and up to million for for commercial items yet there are several cases on record of using the far part process model to conduct in its protest decision in the matter of finlen complex inc the describes an army procurement of meals lodging and transportation military service applicants coming to the military entrance station meps in butte montana the army wanted to establish requirements contract with a local hotel to obtain those since the procurement was for a commercial item valued at less than million the army decided to use simplified acquisition procedures permitted by far the contracting officer issued a request for proposals which the described as the rfp here issued to implement a procurement described on cover sheet as a commercial acquisition simplified acquisition procedures anticipated award of requirements contract for a period followed by four year options to the offeror proposal was considered most advantageous to the government rfp the rfp advised that offers would be evaluated on quality food and transportation proposal facility quality control past performance and price factors id the also advised that the factors would be important than cost or price id otherwise the rfp was silent the relative weight of the evaluation factors the rfp also silent on the role in the selection decision of any evaluation factor other than past performance as for the role past performance the solicitation set forth considerable including how the agency would use the past performance and what it would consider although not disclosed to offerors the relative weights set for this procurement facility quality percent food and transportation facility location percent quality control percent and performance percent agency report ar tab the agency received proposals from six hotels it established a member team which evaluated the proposals and wrote pages of and a consensus report the contracting representative wrote a decision document for the contracting signature incumbent contractor protested and the gao sustained the the protester argued that the selection decision was unfair because solicitation was misleading about the relative importance of evaluation factors making past performance seem much more than it really was the army countered by saying that the rfp silent about the relative importance of the factors and that far and say that agencies are not required disclose the relative importance of evaluation factors in of commercial items when using simplified acquisition procedures gao sustained the protest anyway with respect to the contention that since this on its face is identified as a commercial item procurement simplified acquisition procedures no further analysis is needed disagree we look to the substance of an actions than the form in our view the labeling of a procurement simplified does not absolve the agency from its obligation treat vendors fairly see comark fed sys b jan cpd at use of a procurement approach rather than a simple federal supply purchase triggered requirement to provide for a fair and while there is no dispute here that the procurement of meals hotel rooms for meps applicants appears to squarely within the reach of a commercial item as that term defined at far there is little about the procedures used this procurement that can reasonably be called simplified example the agency elected to use a request for proposal that requires the commercial offerors prepare proposals addressing five evaluation including one factor quality control for which offerors had develop and submit a unique quality control plan contracting officer approval of plan changes throughout the life the contract fn upon receipt of offers agency conducted a evaluation inspected developed consensus scores and made a written recommendation to the meps commander who in turn recommended selection decision to the contracting officer who in turn and documented the despite the simplified label this procurement is very similar any other negotiated acquisition conducted under the rules set in far part those rules require that when offerors are asked prepare detailed proposals those offerors must be advised of weight of all factors and significant subfactors that will the contract award far when our office asked the to address why it would want to withhold this basic information offerors preparing proposals the agency answered that the relative importance of factors may result in offerors their proposals to the more important factors agency supp at in addition the army argued that revealing the weight of factors in the solicitation would hinder the ability to change the weight of those factors during the course its evaluation id in our view neither of these considerations appropriate under the circumstances of this or any procurement nor are they advisable for the integrity of the procurement we recognize that cica exempts solicitations in procurements simplified procedures from the requirement that the importance of evaluation factors be disclosed usc moreover we are sensitive to the fact that the of far parts and is to avoid the use of procedures constrict and complicate the acquisition process and that far and do not on their face limit contracting discretion to disclose or not disclose relative weight of evaluation criteria in a commercial procurement conducted using simplified procedures basic principles of fair play are a touchstone of the procurement system and those principles bound even broad grants agency discretion see intellectual properties inc supra here where the agency required the commercial offerors to detailed proposals addressing unique government withholding the relative weight of evaluation factors denied offerors one of the basic tools used to develop the detailed proposals called for in the in short calling an acquisition simplified does not make it so is not what you say you are doing that counts it is what you do why did the army prepare and issue an rfp require competing to prepare and submit written proposals establish an evaluation and have that board prepare pages of notes and an evaluation none of that is required by far part a search of an american automobile club aaa website yielded a list ten hotels in butte montana why not have the meps commander prepare checklist based on its requirements for food lodging transportation and then have one or two members of the detachment all ten hotels in butte and complete a checklist for each this be done in one or two days why not then have the meps commander to the contracting officer the names of three hotels that meet needs and with which they would be willing to do business contracting officer could then contact the three hotel managers fax email a copy of the rfq to each of them and ask them to fax or price quotes based on the price quotes the contracting officer consultation with the meps commander could pick the hotel represents the best value and negotiate an agreement on contract and conditions the entire contractor selection process and could have been completed in a week or the fair opportunity process under multiple award delivery and order contracts far requires that when placing against multiple award delivery and task order contracts agencies provide each awardee a fair opportunity to be considered for order in excess of far expressly states the source selection procedures in far subpart do not apply this process the fair opportunity process is not subject protest so there are no gao decisions which illustrate the use of far part process model therein nevertheless there is anecdotal and documentary evidence that some agencies have conducting what are essentially selections when awardees a fair opportunity some industry associations have about the bid and proposal costs associated with such and some agencies have published formal guidance for providing a opportunity process which reflects the far part process model for example the guidance issued by the national institutes of information technology acquisition and assessment center information and partners innovations task order guidelines march that guidance provides the solicitation of complete task order proposals from all awardees even discussions with multiple awardees prior to the award of task again the question must be asked why follow the far part model when the far permits the use of a much simpler and more process why ask for complete proposals from all awardees when far does not require that this be done and why discussions with more than one contractor surely there must be simpler way to choose a contractor from among firms that have been evaluated and awarded a contract a way that is less costly for both the government and the some best practices in competitive process one of an acquisition most important tasks is efficient competitive processes while the far part process model suitable for many acquisitions that fall under far part it is cumbersome and costly procedure to use when there numerous competitors and an unnecessarily complex procedure to when ordering from gsa schedules making simplified acquisitions giving offerors a fair opportunity to be considered deliver and task order contracts not even the new procedures for ordering services under gsa schedules and task contracts require contracting officers to follow the far part process as indicated by the kathpal decision even when conducting a part source selection there is no need to require complete information from every competitor at the outset or to evaluate offeror based on every evaluation factor agencies may solicit information and evaluate the competitors in phases narrowing the competitive field based on limited information obtaining detailed and voluminous information from only a acquisition personnel should design their competitive processes comply with statute and regulation to yield good decisions and economize on agency transaction costs and competitor bid and costs acquisition personnel should not follow the far part model without first considering alternative processes instead appropriate they should innovate to develop more efficient in that regard consider the following guiding principle of the acquisition system as set forth in far the far outlines procurement policies and procedures that are by members of the acquisition team if a policy or procedure or particular strategy or practice is in the best interest of government and is not specifically addressed in the far prohibited by law statute or case law executive order or regulation government members of the team should not assume it prohibited rather absence of direction should be interpreted permitting the team to innovate and use sound business judgment is otherwise consistent with law and within the limits of authority contracting officers should take the lead in business process innovations and ensuring that business are some best practices in competitive process design include limit the number of evaluation factors it is the number evaluation factors that determines the amount of information must be obtained from competitors and processed by the in order to reach a decision therefore use no more factors than absolutely necessary and only those factors on the differences among offerors are likely to be more limit the amount of proposal information required from as a general rule and especially when acquiring services do make offerors write technical or management narratives describing how they will do the work or how they organize or quality assurance and safety etc such writings are and costly to prepare and evaluate but they do not necessarily demonstrate a to perform and usually are not binding in any meaningful moreover incorporating such writings into a contract inconsistent with service contracting policy agency technical personnel want to obtain insights how well the competitors understand the work require presentations instead of written technical or use the far part process model in source selections only when is most effective when conducting source selections under far use the far part process model when five or fewer are expected and when obtaining complete proposals from offerors at the outset of the competition will save consider phased submission of information and proposal when conducting source selections under far part and when is a realistic likelihood of receiving more than five consider soliciting proposal information and evaluating in phases alternatively consider planning to use evaluation as a contingency do not follow the far part process model when ordering from schedules when using special ordering procedures services that require a statement of work do not follow the part process model and do not use far part terminology competitive range or discussions or refer to far part the rfq agencies should conduct market select at least three contractors to solicit based on past performance and perhaps an informal interview provide firms with a statement of work by fax or email and ask for quotes then choose one firm with which to negotiate the terms the order or blanket purchase agreement defense agencies with dfars and expecting a large number of to their fair notice of intent should request limited experience past performance and price quote at the outset of competition and progressively narrow the competitive field asking for more detailed proposal information except in circumstances pick one contractor and then negotiate the of the order or blanket purchase agreement do establish a competitive range negotiate with more than one firm a time or solicit revised proposals from more than one do not follow the far part process model when making acquisitions when using simplified acquisition procedures to complex supplies or services worth in excess of and which a synopsis must be published and if planning to ask for information than just a price quote either a select one for negotiations based on experience past and a price quote and then negotiate to agreement on details b narrow the competitive field of competitors on the basis experience past performance and a price quote before asking more detailed proposal information providing a specification statement of work and clauses for price quote development by fax email do not use far part terminology or refer to far part in the rfq do not establish a competitive range negotiate more than one firm at a time or solicit revised quotes or from more than one do not follow the far part process model when giving under a multiple award delivery or task order contract a opportunity to be considered maintain a dossier on each reflecting its performance under task orders and any qualifications that it may have demonstrated during when the time comes to issue an order send a draft of the order each contractor and ask for a price quotation choose contractor for negotiations based on its performance its price quote and if appropriate its qualifications negotiate the details of the order with contractor if you cannot reach a satisfactory agreement then back and choose one of the other contractors for negotiation not solicit complete proposals from every contractor establish competitive range negotiate with more than one contractor at time or solicit revised quotes or offers from more than our government is heavily dependent upon contractors to do work that not inherently governmental and it is going to become even more so the future this means that effective acquisition management is to good government in turn the design of efficient processes is essential to effective acquisition management in this era of urgent needs and ever more limited staff while the far part process model works well in many it is not always the most efficient process and thus does not reflect best practice acquisition professionals must innovate designing competitive processes in order to economize on transaction costs and contractor bid and proposal costs and obtain value efficiently and within a reasonable amount

necessary and it may not be possible negotiate a price that is in accord with all the opinions or with the contracting objective the contracting officer is responsible for exercising requisite judgment and is solely responsible for the final decision the recommendations and counsel of contributing including auditors are advisory only however the contracting should include comments in the price negotiation memorandum significant audit or other specialist recommendations are not d the contracting primary concern is the price government actually pays the eventual cost and profit fee should be a secondary concern the contracting is to negotiate a contract of a type and with a price providing contractor the greatest incentive for efficient and performance the negotiation of a contract type and a price are and should be considered together with the issues of risk uncertainty to the contractor and the government therefore contracting officer should not become preoccupied with any element and should balance contract type cost and profit or fee negotiated to achieve total result and price fair and reasonable to both the government the contractor if however the

competition see exception standards at b of this ii established catalog or market prices of commercial items sold substantial quantities to the general public see exception at paragraph b of this subsection iii prices set by law or regulation see exception standards paragraph b of this for acquisition of a commercial item if the contracting does not have sufficient information to support an exception paragraph a of this subsection but the contracting officer determine the price is fair and reasonable see exception standards paragraph b of this subsection and pricing requirements for exceptional cases where a waiver has been granted exception standards at paragraph b of this subsection for modifications to contracts or subcontracts for items if the basic contract or subcontract was awarded without submission of cost or pricing data because the action was granted exception from cost or pricing data requirements under paragraph of this subsection and the modification does not change the contract subcontract to a contract or subcontract for the acquisition of than a commercial item see exception standards at paragraph b this b standards for exceptions from cost or pricing adequate price competition a price is based adequate price competition i two or more responsible offerors competing independently priced offers responsive to the expressed requirement a award will be made to a responsible offeror whose proposal the greatest value see to the government and price is substantial factor in source selection the lowest evaluated price b there is no finding that the price of the otherwise offeror is unreasonable any such finding must be supported by statement of the facts and approved at a level above the ii there was a reasonable expectation based on market research other assessment that two or more responsible offerors independently would submit priced offers responsive to expressed requirement even though only one offer received from a responsible responsive offeror and a based on the offer received the contracting officer can conclude that the offer was submitted with the expectation competition eg circumstances indicate the offeror believed that at least one other offeror was capable submitting a meaningful responsive offer the offeror had no reason to believe that other potential did not intend to submit an offer b the determination that the proposed price is based on price competition and is reasonable is approved at a level above contracting officer iii price analysis clearly demonstrates that the proposed price reasonable in comparison with current or recent prices for the same similar items purchased in comparable quantities under terms and conditions under contracts that resulted from adequate established catalog or market established price established catalog prices are prices including prices recorded in a catalog price list schedule or verifiable and established record that a are regularly maintained the manufacturer or vendor and b are published or available for customer ii established market price an established market price is a that is established in the course of ordinary and usual trade buyers and sellers free to bargain and that can be substantiated data from sources independent of the iii based on a price may also be based on an established catalog market price if the item or class of items being purchased is itself a catalog or market priced commercial item but is similar to the catalog or market priced commercial item to ensure any difference in prices can be identified and justified resorting to cost iv sold in substantial quantities an item is sold in quantities if there are sales of more than a nominal quantity based the norm of the industry segment in determining what constitutes substantial quantity the contracting officer should consider things as the size of the market and how recently the item introduced into the market models samples prototypes experimental units are not substantial quantities for services to sold in substantial quantities they must also be customarily by the offeror using personnel regularly employed and equipment any is necessary regularly maintained principally to provide a the method used to establish sales may be sales order shipment invoice actual recorded sales or other records so long the method used is consistent provides an accurate indication of activity and is verifiable if the item would not otherwise for an exception sales of the item by affiliates may be considered addition sales of essentially the same commercial item by manufacturers or vendors may be considered in determining whether are substantial provided that the price of those sales is considered data to support sales quantities may also come from manufacturers industry associations or marketing groups financial reports b an exception may apply for an item based on the market price of item regardless of the quantity of sales of the item previously made the offeror or the types of customers for these sales provided sales of the same or similar items by other sellers meet the v general public the general public ordinarily consists of other than the us government or its instrumentalities eg government corporations sales to the general public do not sales to affiliates of the offerors or purchases by the us on behalf of foreign governments such as for foreign military if the contracting officer can determine without requiring from the offeror that sales are for government end use these need not be considered sales to the general prices set by law or regulation pronouncements in the form periodic rulings reviews or similar actions of a governmental or embodied in the laws are sufficient to set a commercial items for acquisition of a commercial item if contracting officer does not have sufficient information to support exception under or a the contracting officer grant an exception for a contract subcontract or modification of contract or subcontract if the contracting officer obtains the information described in cost or pricing data may obtained for such a commercial item only if the contracting makes a written determination that the pricing information inadequate for performing a price analysis and determining exceptional cases the head of the contracting activity without power of delegation waive the requirement for submission cost or pricing data the authorization for the waiver and the for granting it shall be in writing a waiver may be considered another exception does not apply but the price can be determined to fair and reasonable without submission of cost or pricing data example if cost or pricing data were furnished on previous buys and the contracting officer determines such data are when combined with updated information a waiver may be granted if head of the contracting activity has waived the requirement submission of cost or pricing data the contractor or subcontractor to whom the waiver relates shall be considered as been required to make available cost or pricing data award of any subcontract expected to exceed the cost pricing data threshold requires the submission of cost or pricing unless an exception otherwise applies to the modifications this exception only applies when the contract or subcontract was exempt from cost or pricing data based adequate price competition catalog or market price or price set law or regulation for modifications of contracts subcontracts for commercial items the exception at applies if the modification does not change the item from a item to a noncommercial item however if the modification to contract or a subcontract changes the nature of the work under contract or subcontract either by a change to the commercial item or the addition of other noncommercial work the contracting officer not prohibited from obtaining cost or pricing data for the added c special circumstances when purchasing commercial items it not necessary to obtain information supporting an exception for line item sampling techniques may be if the us government has acted favorably on an exception for the same or similar items the contracting officer may consider prior submissions as support for the current exception request from the submission of new information does not relieve the officer from the requirement to determine reasonableness of price the current when acquiring by separate contract an item included on an federal supply service or information technology service multiple schedule contract the contracting officer should grant an and not require documentation if the offeror has provided proof that exception has been granted for the schedule item price analysis be performed in accordance with to determine reasonableness the contracting officer and offeror may make special for the submission of exception requests for repetitive these arrangements can take any form as long as they set forth effective period and the exception criteria at are such arrangements may be extended to other government offices their d requesting an exception in order to qualify for an other than an exception for adequate price competition from requirements to submit cost or pricing data the offeror must submit written request the solicitation provision at or methods may be used it is the responsibility of the officer to determine based on the information submitted and any information available to the contracting officer which exception any requiring cost or pricing a pursuant to usc a and usc b cost or data shall be obtained only if the contracting officer concludes none of the exceptions in applies however if the officer has sufficient information available to determine reasonableness then a waiver under the exception at should be considered the threshold for obtaining cost or pricing is this amount will be subject to adjustment october and every five years thereafter unless an applies cost or pricing data are required before accomplishing any the following actions expected to exceed the threshold in effect on date of agreement on price or the date of award whichever is or in the case of existing contracts the threshold specified in i the award of any negotiated contract except for actions such as letter ii the award of a subcontract at any tier if the contractor and subcontractor have been required to furnish cost or data but see exceptional cases at iii the modification of any sealed bid or negotiated whether or not cost or pricing data were initially required subcontract covered by paragraph of this subsection adjustment amounts shall consider both increases and decreases example a modification resulting from a reduction of and an increase of is a pricing adjustment this requirement does not apply when unrelated separately priced changes for which cost or pricing data would otherwise be required are included for administrative convenience the same unless prohibited because an exception at the head of the contracting activity without power of delegation authorize the contracting officer to obtain cost or pricing data pricing actions below the pertinent threshold in paragraph a this subsection provided the action exceeds the simplified threshold the head of the contracting activity shall justify requirement for cost or pricing data the documentation shall include written finding that cost or pricing data are necessary to whether the price is fair and reasonable and the facts supporting b when cost or pricing data

the contractor and the higher subcontractor shall i conduct price analyses and when subcontractor is required to submit cost or pricing data or if contractor or higher tier subcontractor is unable to perform adequate price analysis cost analyses for all subcontracts include the results of these analyses as part of their own cost pricing data submission and iii when required in accordance submit the subcontractor cost or pricing data as part their own cost or pricing data b unless the subcontract qualifies for an exception under any contractor required to submit cost or pricing data also obtain cost or pricing data before awarding any subcontract or order expected to exceed the cost or pricing data threshold or any modification involving a price adjustment expected to exceed cost or pricing data c the requirements in paragraphs a and b of this modified to relate to higher tier rather than to the prime contractor shall apply to lower subcontracts for which subcontractor cost or pricing data are d if the prime contractor negotiates subcontract prices negotiating the prime contract such subcontract prices nevertheless be reviewed and analyzed by the government in no should such negotiated subcontract prices be accepted as the evidence that these prices are fair and prospective subcontractor cost or pricing a the contracting officer shall require a contractor that is to submit cost or pricing data also to submit to the government cause submission of accurate complete and current cost or data from prospective subcontractors in support of each cost estimate that is or more both more than cost or pricing data threshold and more than percent of the proposed price or considered to be necessary adequately pricing the prime contract these subcontract cost pricing data may be submitted using a standard form sf pricing proposal cover sheet cost or pricing data b the contracting officer shall require the prospective contractor support subcontractor cost estimates below the threshold in with any data or information including other subcontractor needed to establish a reasonable c if the prospective contractor satisfies the contracting that a subcontract will be priced on the basis of one of exceptions the contracting officer shall not require submission cost or pricing data to the government in that case if the estimate is based upon the cost or pricing data of the subcontractor most likely to be awarded the subcontract contracting officer shall not require submission to the government data from more than one proposed subcontractor for that d subcontractor cost or pricing data shall be accurate complete current as of the date of price agreement or if applicable date agreed upon between the parties given on the certificate of current cost or pricing data the prospective shall be responsible for updating a prospective e in exceptional cases the contracting officer may with approval of the chief of the contracting office excuse a contractor from submitting subcontractor cost or pricing data and required related analyses before completion of negotiations of prime contract the prime contractor must however obtain this cost pricing data before award of the subcontract in question any from a prospective contractor to be excused from subcontractor data before completion of negotiations of the contract must be supported by an explanation as to why the data analyses cannot be submitted in a timely manner if excusing prospective contractor appears to be appropriate the officer shall provide the chief of the contracting office with prospective explanation the contracting supporting rationale and a discussion of how the subcontract will be determined to be fair and reasonable or what steps will taken to protect the interest of the government eg include contract clause that provides for negotiating an adjustment to prime contract amount after field pricing a when obtaining field pricing support on a prime contractor in accordance with the contracting officer should audit or field pricing support to analyze and evaluate the proposal a subcontractor at any tier notwithstanding availability of data analyses performed by the prime contractor if the contracting believes that such support is necessary to ensure reasonableness of total proposed price this step may be appropriate when for there is a business relationship between the contractor subcontractor not conducive to independence and the contractor is a sole source and the subcontract costs a substantial part of the contract the contractor has been denied access to the the contracting officer determines that because of factors such the size of the proposed subcontract price audit or field support for a subcontract or subcontracts at any tier is critical to fully detailed analysis of the prime contract the contractor or higher tier subcontractor has been cited having significant estimating system deficiencies in the area subcontract pricing especially the failure to perform adequate analyses of proposed subcontract costs or to perform analyses prior to negotiation of the prime contract with government a lower tier subcontractor has been cited as having estimating system b when the contracting officer requests the cognizant aco or to review a cost the request shall include when available a copy of any prepared by the prime contractor or higher tier subcontractor proposal cost or pricing data provided by subcontractor and the results of the prime cost or c when the government performs the subcontract analysis government shall furnish to the prime contractor or higher subcontractor with the consent of the subcontractor reviewed summary of the analysis performed in determining any costs by element included in the subcontract proposal if subcontractor withholds consent the government shall furnish a of unacceptable costs for each element in such a way as to disclosure of subcontractor proprietary prenegotiation a the process of determining prenegotiation objectives helps contracting officer to judge the overall reasonableness of prices and to negotiate a fair and reasonable price or cost and fee setting the prenegotiation objectives the contracting officer analyze the proposal taking into account the field report if any any audit report and technical analysis whether or part of a field pricing report and other pertinent data such independent government cost estimates and price histories this may include sessions with the offeror when the officer deems b the contracting officer shall establish prenegotiation before the negotiation of any pricing action the scope and depth the analysis supporting the objectives should be directly related the dollar value importance and complexity of the pricing when cost analysis is required the analysis shall address pertinent issues to be negotiated the cost objectives and profit or fee c the cost objective and proposed pricing directly affect the profit or fee objective because profit or fee only one of several variables the contracting officer shall not agree on profit fee without concurrent agreement on cost and type of contract agreement on the exact values or assigned to individual factors see is required during negotiations and should not be price negotiation a at the conclusion of each negotiation of an initial or price the

to buying with documentation to assist negotiators in achieving rates in the absence of a fpra or fprr field pricing reports include support for rates a reviews are a specialized form of cost reviews differ from traditional evaluation methods traditional reviews local contract audit and contract personnel primarily base their evaluation of forecasted costs on analysis of historical costs and trends in contrast reviews do not assume that a historical costs efficient and economical operation instead these reviews evaluate economy and efficiency of the existing work methods materials facilities operating systems and these reviews are accomplished by a team of contracting contract administration pricing audit and representatives the objective of reviews is to both short and improvements in the economy efficiency in order to reduce the cost of performance of contracts in addition by providing rationale for any and quantifying their impact on cost the government will be able to develop realistic objectives for b there are two types of review see and overhead review see these reviews may be performed together or the scope of a review can range from a examining the entire operation including overhead and selected major subcontractors to a review examining specific portions of a program a program review is used to evaluate significant of direct costs such as material and labor and associated costs usually incurred in the production of major systems when program review is conducted relative to a proposal a separate audit report on the proposal is b a program review should be considered particularly the case of a major system acquisition see part some initial production has already taken the contract will be awarded on a there are future year production requirements for quantities of like the items being acquired have a history of increasing the work is sufficiently defined to permit an effective and major changes are sufficient time is available to plan and conduct the review adequately personnel with the required skills are available or can be for the duration of the c the contracting officer should decide which elements of operation have the greatest potential for cost savings assign the available personnel resources accordingly while particular elements to be analyzed are a function of the contract task elements such as manufacturing pricing and management and organization and subcontract and vendor management normally reviewed in a d in acquisitions for which a program review conducted a separate program review team report in accordance with agency procedures is required field reports are required only to the extent that they contribute to combined team position the contracting officer shall consider findings and recommendations contained in the program review team report when negotiating the contract price completing the negotiation the contracting officer shall provide administrative contracting officer aco a report of any uneconomical or inefficient practices together with a report correction or disposition agreements reached with the contractor contracting officer shall establish a plan to monitor correction of the uneconomical or inefficient e when a program review is planned the officer should state this fact in the acquisition plan see and in the overhead a an overhead review is used to evaluate indirect such as fringe benefits shipping and receiving facilities equipment depreciation plant maintenance and security taxes general and administrative activities it is normally used to and negotiate a forward pricing rate agreement fpra with contractor when an overhead review is conducted separate audit report is b the following factors should be considered when contractor sites for overhead dollar amount of government level of government level of noncompetitive government volume of proposal major system or mergers acquisitions other conditions eg changes in accounting systems or business c the objective of the overhead review is to significant indirect cost elements identify inefficient uneconomical practices and recommend corrective action if it conducted in conjunction with a program review a overhead review report is not required however findings and recommendations of the overhead team or separate overhead review report shall be provided to aco the aco should use this information to form the basis for government position in negotiating a fpra with the contractor the shall establish a plan to monitor the correction of uneconomical or inefficient estimating a the consistent preparation of proposals using an estimating system benefits both the government and the contractor increasing the accuracy and reliability of individual cognizant audit activities when it is appropriate to do so establish and manage regular programs for reviewing estimating systems or methods in order to reduce scope of reviews to be performed on individual proposals the negotiation process and increase the reliability of the results of estimating system reviews shall be documented in b the auditor shall send a copy of the estimating system report and a copy of the official notice of corrective action to each contracting office and contract administration office substantial business with that contractor significant deficiencies corrected by the contractor shall be a consideration in proposal analyses and c in determining the acceptability of a system the auditor should the source of data for estimates and the procedures for that the data are accurate complete and the documentation developed and maintained in support of the assignment of responsibilities for originating reviewing approving the procedures followed for developing estimates for direct indirect cost the extent of coordination and communication between elements responsible for the estimate management support including estimate approval establishment controls and training unit a direct and indirect costs are generally allocated to contracts accordance with the cost accounting standards of cfr chapter when applicable and the contract cost principles and procedures part however for the purpose of pricing all items of distribution of those costs within contracts shall be on a basis ensures that unit prices are in proportion to the base eg manufacturing or acquisition any method of costs to line items that distorts the unit prices shall not be for example distributing costs equally among line items is acceptable except when there is little or no variation in base b however the policy in paragraph a of this subsection does apply to any contract or subcontract item of supply for which the is or is based on an established catalog or market price of commercial item sold in substantial quantities to the general under or a commercial item exception c in addition when contracting by negotiation without full and competition contracting officers shall require that offerors in their proposals those items of supply which they will manufacture or to which they will not contribute significant value contracting officer shall require similar information when by negotiation with full and open competition if adequate competition is not expected see the information not be requested in connection with the award of contracts under general services competitive multiple award program the information shall not be requested for commercial sold in substantial quantities to the general public when the are or are based on established catalog or market prices information shall be used to determine whether the intrinsic value an item has been distorted through application of overhead and such items should be considered for breakout the contracting may require such information in any other negotiated contracts contract a the contracting officer shall insert the clause at integrity of unit prices in all solicitations and contracts for acquisitions at or below the simplified acquisition construction or services under part utility services under part of this service contracts where supplies are not contracts for petroleum b the contracting officer shall insert the clause with its i when contracting without full and open competition or when by agency unbalanced a offers shall also be analyzed to determine whether they unbalanced with respect to prices or separately priced line items is particularly important when evaluating the relationship of the for first article tests or test items to the price for the units and in evaluating the prices for options in relationship to prices for the basic b an offer is mathematically unbalanced if it is based on which are significantly less than cost for some contract line items significantly overstated in relation to cost for others an offer materially unbalanced if it is mathematically unbalanced and there is a reasonable doubt that the offer would result in lowest overall cost to the government even though it is the evaluated offer the offer is so grossly unbalanced that its acceptance would tantamount to allowing an advance c offers that are materially unbalanced may be d depending on the nature of the acquisition contracting shall use either price analysis or cost analysis techniques or combination of the two techniques to determine if offers materially unbalanced the following are examples of techniques can be used to determine if an offer is unbalanced although examples specifically relate to first article testing they may also used for other procurements where unbalanced offers may be of compare all offers to determine if the offerors have higher prices for the first articles than for the production units comparison should consider whether the government or the will perform the first article for an individual offer compare the relationship of first prices to prices for production items the cost to the offeror first articles may be estimated i by comparing the total offered including the first article to an alternate proposal by same offeror which does not include first article testing or ii if cost data has been submitted by certain elements of cost to determine for instance manufacturing and special tooling and test equipment costs prorated among the first articles and the production units or are applied to the first articles if cost data are not available it be necessary for contracting officers to estimate contractor scope of this a prescribes policies for establishing the profit or fee portion the government prenegotiation b applies to price negotiations based on cost c prescribes policies for development and use of structured approach for determining the profit or fee objective see for the contents of a structured approach d specifies situations requiring contracting officers to profit and considerations for that a profit or fee prenegotiation objectives do not represent net income to contractors rather they represent element of the potential total remuneration that contractors receive for contract performance over and above allowable costs potential remuneration element and the estimate allowable costs to be incurred in contract performance together the total prenegotiation objective just as actual may vary from estimated costs the actual realized or fee may vary from negotiated profit or fee because of such as efficiency of performance incurrence of costs the government not recognize as allowable and contract b it is in the interest to offer opportunities for financial rewards sufficient to efficient contract performance attract the best capabilities qualified large and small business concerns to government and maintain a viable industrial c both the government and contractors should be concerned with as a motivator of efficient and effective contract negotiations aimed merely at reducing prices by reducing without proper recognition of the function of profit are not in interest negotiation of extremely low profits use historical averages or automatic application of percentages to total estimated costs do not provide proper for optimum contract performance with the exception of ceilings in on profit and fee agencies shall not establish administrative ceilings or create procedures that could be represented to contractors as de a structured approaches see for determining profit or prenegotiation objectives provide a discipline for ensuring that relevant factors are considered subject to the authorities agencies making noncompetitive contract awards over totaling million or more a shall use a structured approach for determining the profit or objective in those acquisitions that require cost analysis may prescribe specific exemptions for situations in which use of a structured approach would be clearly b agencies may use another structured contracting officer a when the price negotiation is not based on cost contracting officers are not required to analyze b when the price negotiation is based on cost analysis officers in agencies that have a structured approach shall use it analyze profit when not using a structured approach officers shall comply with in developing profit or prenegotiation c contracting officers shall use the government prenegotiation objective amounts as the basis for calculating the profit or prenegotiation objective before the allowability of facilities cost of money this cost was included in profits or fees before applying profit or fee factors the contracting officer exclude any facilities capital cost of money included in the objective amounts if the prospective contractor fails to identify propose facilities capital cost of money in a proposal for a that will be subject to the cost principles for contracts commercial organizations see subpart facilities capital cost money will not be an allowable cost in any resulting contract d the contracting officer shall not negotiate a price or fee exceeds the following statutory limitations imposed by d and usc i for experimental developmental or research work performed under contract the fee shall not exceed percent the estimated cost excluding ii for services for public works or the contract price or the estimated cost and fee for production delivery of designs plans drawings and specifications shall exceed percent of the estimated cost of construction of public work or utility excluding iii for other contracts the fee shall not percent of the estimated cost excluding the limitations in subdivisions and iii of subsection shall apply also to the maximum fees and contracts however deviation to the limitation for a or contract may authorized in accordance with subpart e the contracting officer shall not require any contractor to submit details of its profit or fee objective but consider them if they are submitted f if a change or modification calls for essentially the same and mix of work as the basic contract and is of relatively dollar value compared to the total contract value the officer may use the basic profit or fee rate as prenegotiation objective for that change or solicitation provision and contract a the contracting officer shall insert the provision at facilities capital cost of money in solicitations expected to in contracts that are subject to the cost principles for contracts commercial organizations see subpart b if the prospective contractor does not propose facilities cost of money in its offer insert the clause at waiver facilities capital cost of money in the resulting common unless it is clearly inappropriate or not applicable each outlined in paragraphs a through f of this subsection shall considered by agencies in developing structured approaches and by contracting officers in analyzing whether or not using a structured a contractor effort this factor measures the complexity of the and the resources required of the prospective contractor for performance greater profit opportunity should be provided contracts requiring a high degree of professional and managerial and to prospective contractors whose skills facilities and assets can be expected to lead to efficient and economical performance subfactors through following shall be in determining contractor effort but they may be modified in situations to accommodate differences in the categories used prospective contractors for listing material acquisition this subfactor measures the managerial technical effort needed to obtain the required purchased parts material subcontracted items and special tooling include i the complexity of the items required ii the number purchase orders and subcontracts to be awarded and administered whether established sources are available or new or second sources be developed and iv whether material will be obtained routine purchase orders or through complex subcontracts detailed specifications profit consideration should correspond to managerial and technical effort conversion direct labor this subfactor measures the of direct engineering manufacturing and other labor to converting raw materials data and subcontracted items into the contract considerations include the diversity of engineering scientific manufacturing labor skills required and the amount and quality supervision and coordination needed to perform the contract indirect costs this subfactor measures how the indirect costs contribute to contract performance the elements in the allocable indirect costs should be given the consideration they would receive if treated as direct labor the elements of indirect

state and local leaders to work together on reforms and develop comprehensive plans that enhance local modernize school practices and improve educational outcomes students we are fully in support of the national coalition on request that diversity be prioritized in the race to top district competition criteria the importance of integration and avoiding racial isolation has been reaffirmed as compelling government interest by five justices of the us court in parents involved in community schools v seattle district and by the department itself in its december guidance on the voluntary use of race to achieve diversity and racial isolation in elementary and secondary schools report jointly with the us department of justice we recognize challenges in creating and maintaining racial and economic however we believe that it is inappropriate to use federal funds perpetuate racial and economic isolation in our public schools at very least new federal funds should incentivize local efforts and promote in addition to our support for the promotion of diverse and learning environments we are also in support of prioritizing engagement as a vital mechanism for improving school diversity we recognize and commend the inclusion of involving stakeholder engagement and support we are concerned that race to the top district competition proposal the most important source of federal funding for schools lacks a clear commitment parental parental engagement is an essential component of school parental involvement has been closely linked to effective turnaround strategies greater student achievement and improved attendance parental engagement also contributes to greater readiness improved student social skills and higher rates the department has previously identified parental engagement a core component of school reform in the blueprint for revising elementary and secondary education act esea the department the importance of strengthening and supporting comprehensive that promoted systematic inclusion of parents and communities partners enhancing district capacity around family providing additional resources expanding grant opportunities providing other financial incentives to create programs that family and community engagement and identifying and supporting practices that focus on engagement strategies that increase achievement yet this acknowledged interest in family engagement mostly absent from the draft criteria of the race to the top effective parent engagement strategies must be part of comprehensive education plan and not simply voluntary or parents should be fully informed not only of their right to that their child is receiving a education but also their responsibilities in creating an enriched learning outside the classroom we urge the department to adopt measures prioritize and encourage parental engagement in all schools provide the proper resources incentives and guidance for schools new federal funds should incentivize local efforts to promote prioritize innovative educational approaches that merge reform and the compelling need for parental engagement leas regional groups of leas are in an optimal position to promote parental engagement they can institute school district policies that foster meaningful parental monitor levels of parental engagement at the and and proactively address unique issues that arise striving to include parents in the school in accordance with these general comments there are several which we believe the department of education should include in final competition design they are as as an absolute priority panels that are responsible for lea applications during the peer review process must include critical mass of parents and members of the local as an absolute priority personalized learning environment department should add that an application must coherently comprehensively address how it will implement strategies provide parents with meaningful opportunities to engaged in their education including involvement school processes and meaningful with school monitor and track district and school efforts to parental and community as a competitive preference priority in addition to the allocated for providing family and student supports the should also whether the applicant has formed a coherent and partnership with all types of parents as well as public private organizations such as local or other groups to support the plan described in absolute priority under selection criteria district capacity and success factors reform conditions the third articulated goal of stakeholder engagement and support should be modified explicitly say meaningful parent community and engagement and support additionally the department a clear definition of what constitutes meaningful community and stakeholder engagement and a detailed description of how can demonstrate ways which families teachers principals and community have been engaged in the development of the proposal and appropriate how the proposal has been revised based on engagement and feedback making letters of support from key stakeholders parent organization and local and civic organizations mandating that parental and community feedback included in the application if an lea fails to provide letters of support evidence of parental and community feedback provide a detailed description of why letters of orfeedback were not thank you for the opportunity to present these comments the competition presents a unique opportunity to creatively challenges within our public education system we urge the to include changes to the competition criteria that reflect commitment to parental engagement this necessitates clearly standards and guidelines and not simply

supports the department of emphasis in the proposed district race to the top on teaching and learning implementation of the rigorous common standards and their related assessments is the most critical currently facing our urban schools along with ensuring disadvantaged and minority students are learning this content at rates that will overcome persistent achievement the four areas of reform in the rttt authorization stress importance of raising content standards creating assessment and systems necessary to track adapt and evaluate performance the effective teaching of academic content often the weakest link education reform initiatives and ensuring that the lowest schools and students do not continue to the district rttt program provides an important opportunity additional investment in local systemic reform activities not available in the current environment of declining state and resources and shortchanged in esea and idea funding additional areas of support in in this national

average and the metric serves as a proxy for the full range of disadvantaged minority school children who are projected to soon become majority of the student the following comments from the council of the great city emphasize one overriding concern in the proposed requirements and provide a number of additional suggestions strengthen the operation and impact of the diversion of effort from the four rttt reform areas into tangential school districts should be allow to maximize this new opportunity by addressing the rttt reform areas in the context of own local systemic improvement and academic reform efforts being channeled into new or tangential directions by requirements and review criteria in our opinion the absolute competitive priorities on personalized learning plans and services are entirely new directions not reflected in the rttt authorization which could result in school district resources and efforts being diverted away from higher standards expanded data and assessment systems curriculum revised instructional approaches and new accountability measures actively underway in school addressing both the absolute and competitive priority criteria in project will be a practical necessity not a choice order to receive a grant under the proposed rules districts likely have to set up elaborate systems and procedures to meet absolute requirement of an individual learning plan for each as well as to identify integrate and a variety services for a student and a family districts may want to apply for these particular approaches and should be allowed to do so but other districts that committed to other approaches for increasing academic rigor teachers and principals tracking performance and instructional delivery systems should be able to propose their thinking in the four rttt reform areas without narrowing their to fit prescriptive parameters of the proposed personalized and integrated services priorities moreover there is limited on the effectiveness of these practices to warrant these particular priorities being implemented on a national differentiated instruction can be delivered and appropriate student interventions can be provided without the personalized learning in the proposed requirements example a large segment of special educators acknowledge that the child left behind subgroup performance and accountability produced more significant academic progress for students disabilities over the past decade than three decades of education plans ieps and prescriptive idea procedural requirements new study to be issued this summer by the council of the great schools and the american institutes for research shows improvements in teaching and student achievement will not result when timely information on assessments are available unless practitioners pay particular to specific instructional strategies and teaching skills that informed by the data the council is concerned that the proposed personalized learning systems and individual student learning plans add formalities and procedures to the instructional process directly affecting the quality of teaching or student with only grants being awarded the initiative should a wider variety of approaches to local systemic reform narrowing district options under the proposed absolute and recommendation delete the absolute priority on personalized and the competitive priority on integrated community services in of more flexible approaches to the four reform areas of rttt delete each of the selection criteria and subcriteria associated the current absolute and competitive union support as part of stakeholder engagement and support not as condition of a number of council districts have expressed concern over reticence to fully support and participate in a rttt project issues arose in a number of districts during the state rttt process the proposed requirements include the signature of local union along with the signatures of the district and school board as a condition of eligibility the superintendent school board are legal representatives of the school district as a of local government the union is not the council finds inappropriate for any official to be delegated aspect of control over the eligibility or ineligibility of a district in the application for a federal grant the council that the selection criteria for meaningful stakeholder engagement support be weighted to reflect the importance of this criterion possibly with additional points for union support the council finds that a percent support level among teachers in leas collective bargaining is unnecessarily high and suggests recommendation strike paragraph in the eligibility criteria on and appropriately weigh the stakeholder engagement and criterion in paragraph under reform conditions in selection b on page also on page in selection criteria at least percent and insert a delete mayor county executive and township administrator comment response and revise state comment documentation many school districts serve multiple local communities headed by variety of mayors or township administrators as well as executives securing formal comments from each of these officials burdensome and of questionable benefit the stakeholder engagement support requirements in selection criteria should suffice ensuring the involvement of appropriate local elected officials at state level a school district should not be required to document the state declined to comment it should be sufficient to evidence that the state was provided with the opportunity to for at least five business recommendation on page under state comment period paragraph subparagraph a strike evidence that the state declined to and insert evidence that the state was given five business days which to comment and on page paragraph strike the mayor or town administrator comment period increase emphasis on districtwide systemic given the limited amount of funding available for each the council supports allowing a district to focus rttt funding particular segments or portions of the school system rttt however a systemic reform initiative should demonstrate how the activities contribute to districtwide reform the council consolidating the various subcriteria addressing districtwide reform into the vision selection criteria a in order to fully the overall impact of the recommendation relocate selection criteria districtwide change on page as a new paragraph under selection criteria a on page consolidate selection criteria and subcriteria for easier development and peer the proposed requirements set out an extensive range selection criteria which will result in review points being among far too many provisions the council suggests consolidating streamlining many of the criteria and subcriteria and allow the reviewers to focus on the most critical reform issues and the recommendation to remove the multiple requirements related on personalized learning see above will substantially streamline the application recommendation the council suggests wherever possible to assurances instead of specific requirements in the selection eg the salary and expenditure information under selection b on page consolidate selection criteria d on transition plan continuous improvement on page and the accessibility and earning options in selection criteria on page into the quality plan criteria under selection criteria b on page revise funding ranges to better reflect the varying sizes of districts and increase the number of available the funding structure of the proposed grants is flawed district or consortia serving students could receive up to million while a district serving hundreds of thousands of students limited to receiving million in effect a district of students which is times larger than a district serving students could receive only million in additional funding funding structure will have some weaknesses but the proposed is not equitable the lower end of the funding structure should lowered the middle range should be adjusted and the upper end be increased by lowering the lower range of grants more grants can awarded with available recommendation to million for students million for to students to million for or more superintendent evaluation and school board evaluation requirements be the impact and appropriateness of an evaluation of a school which is the legal authority of most school districts as units of government seems questionable particularly for elected boards additionally most urban school boards already evaluative criteria for their clarification needed on requirement for an school districts will be uncertain about whether they must meet program requirement regarding on page the requirements should clarify the precise basis for a being required to undergo an assessment and develop a plan see program requirements in paragraph on if there is no official notice or criteria provided for districts then this requirement should be made into an assurance district would assure that if is determined the grant period an assessment and remedial plan would developed and jeff simering council of the great city submitted by council of the great city schools on tue june vote vote the national education association appreciates the opportunity provide comments on the race to the top district competition dated may while nea remains concerned about the use competitive funding programs to advance education goals we support broad concept of allowing districts to apply for race to the top funds for the first time in this we also strongly support the requirement that key stakeholders such educators and their representatives must support plans involvement of those who work in our schools in the development implementation of this program will bring experience and expertise its design and greatly increase capacity for we are sympathetic to the broad concept of advancing learning through this competition as long as it is promoted unnecessary requirements and with sustained fiscal support a chance of success and local stakeholder support with so many struggling financially around the country and meeting so many for change such as stronger standards and assessments and requirements of the state waiver programs great attention should paid to make sure that any new proposal has a clear focus and does impose unnecessary burdens that might tilt the scales applicants that have the fewest resources and serve the students in this regard we would urge the department of education consider whether its heavy emphasis on its existing rttt proposals in the competition might be reduced in favor of personalized learning and comments on the specifics of the proposal eligibility criteria and application o we believe that the minimum of participating students in district will exclude individual districts that could succeed advancing personalized learning from applying requiring them to best seek out a consortium in spite of their own unique strengths and goals moreover the coordination of an ambitious program among a number of small and often geographically isolated that could comprise such a consortium may require human and resources that are not readily available in smaller systems when coupled with the complex data o we recommend deletion of the eligibility and application of a clear track record of commitment to the core assurance areas including designing and implementing a evaluation system as defined by the department this criterion tilt the scales against states dilute the focus personalized learning and make it difficult for schools with fewest resources and the greatest challenges to o we applaud the requirement of a local signature on the application and urge that it be required even in absence of collective bargaining to ensure the support of stakeholders during the critical implementation process and the capacity for success we also applaud the requirement signatures from all presidents on memoranda understanding mous with consortium participants we believe provision could be strengthened through the inclusion of a that be involved in the development of o to the extent charter school leas are considered for grants we several concerns charter sector accountability and transparency weak and inadequate in at least some important respects in most the southern regional education recently issued report schools in sreb states critical questions and next steps recommendations for how states can do more to ensure academic and adequate oversight among those we believe merit consideration policies o require charter contracts to include meaningful measures of performance and also specify the types of measures that most gauge the academic growth of charter school students in state should continually review how well these gauge academic growth and attempt to improve o ensure that all authorizers establish clear and rigorous and procedures for charter school application reviews and charter school oversight authorizers must establish specific criteria for the continuation and renewal or revocation of school contracts and must aggressively hold charter schools to criteria states and authorizers must also close poorly charter schools that fail to improve over o ensure that charter school authorizers have the capacity to support rigorous high quality application review process and to rigorous oversight while respecting charter autonomy states maintain small authorizers with limited should consider ways to aid small authorizers extending the expertise and abilities of larger authorizers to o ensure that authorizers rigorously review every charter school regular intervals as determined by each this is important ensure that poorly performing schools either make improvements or closed within a reasonable period of the federal government can incentivize states

towns opportunities comment but recommend that attention be given to how to make practical when a district includes a significant number of and o to the extent teacher evaluation is required in this evaluations should be comprehensive based on multiple indicators provide teachers with clear and actionable feedback to enhance practice and should include all three of the following i indicators of teacher practice demonstrating a matter knowledge skill in planning and delivering instruction engages students ability to address issues of equity and and ability to monitor and assess student learning and instruction accordingly ii indicators of teacher contribution growth demonstrating a professional growth and to a success and iii indicators contribution to student learning and growth demonstrating a impact on student learning and growth such indicators must authentic reflect that there are multiple factors that impact learning beyond a control and be agreed to by local unless tests are shown to be appropriate scientifically valid and reliable for the purpose measuring both student learning and a performance such should not be used to support any employment action against a and may be used only to provide formative o in the definition of student growth on page we recommend multiple before measures in numbered paragraph one and before alternative measures in numbered paragraph two in definition of teacher evaluation we applaud the inclusion of phrase multiple valid o with regard to student growth we encourage the department to maximum flexibility in how student growth measures are included in systems when providing guidance to potential grantees when grant applications and when providing guidance technical assistance to grantees because in some jurisdictions growth measures are bargained or agreed upon by all parties major concern is that many of the teacher evaluation systems are being implemented without being piloted or and we encourage the department to focus on those grantees that in such rich feedback systems in early implementation furthermore we urge the department to stress the importance evaluation systems being implemented with fidelity and without such as some evaluations being based on the student growth other absolute o nea believes that promoting innovation around personalized is an important education goal one key component in learning is the support of educators who provide the learning which we hope will receive support through this including use of funds to recall or hire education support professionals and specialized instructional personnel to advance personalized o nea also applauds the goal of priorities of ensuring a group of rttt and applications as well as rural and selection o the requirement that applicants set forth a comprehensive coherent reform vision that builds on its work in the four educational assurance areas takes away from the focus on learning and puts the focus on rttt reforms this the reality that sustained personalized learning as described in proposal will in and of itself be a heavy lift for districts and it also heavily disadvantages state o the inclusion of teacher attendance as a vision factor anomalous and the definition of teacher attendance could protected collective bargaining district o requiring districts to demonstrate a clear record of success advancing excellence means that districts with the greatest could find it difficult to receive grant funds the result will be funds flow to the districts that already have relatively capacity rather than to those with greatest o we would urge the department to emphasize that the competition allows a district to partner with district to build functionality and capacity districts have significant capacity to personalize opportunities for all students encouraging these districts to with a struggling district and use funds to collaborate may an effective way to improve the education of students in schools and provide valuable lessons for all involved districts student o the proposed rules evaluate applicants in part on their ability implement one of the four school intervention models in schools however some districts have no reason or requirement implement one of the four school intervention models furthermore proposed rules do not ask applicants to implement intervention model therefore the requirement that a demonstrate their ability to implement one of the four models does seem strongly related to the goal of this proposed o we encourage the department to clarify for privacy reasons that required data transparency around salaries will be adjusted so personally identifiable financial information will not be o we strongly support the encouragement of meaningful engagement support of stakeholders in the proposed rules including support educators and their representatives in leas with collective and percent support of educators in participating schools in without collective bargaining not just the teachers but all the involvement of local stakeholders will bring and experience to proposed personalized learning plans and promote solutions tailored to the unique circumstances of schools and preparing students for college and o the proposal includes a number of proposed new local structures including professional teams or communities that improve practice by using feedback provided by the teacher and principal evaluation system and also school teams that have sufficient flexibility and autonomy over such as school schedules and calendars school staffing models roles responsibilities for educators and and budgets these structures raise important issues regard to school autonomy existing structures collective bargaining their inclusion in this proposal along with significant changes envisioned in teacher responsibilities creation of digital learning content and personalized learning highlight the need for and educator support appear in other parts of the o we also encourage the inclusion of a savings clause for rights federal state and local law as well as collective bargaining to the one included in the waiver policy and o the proposal promotes the opportunity for students to progress earn credit based on demonstrated mastery not the amount of time on a topic this concept should be further studied by the in light of core content standards assigned to each grade level state tests which measure specific skills at each grade o the proposal calls upon leas and schools to support learning through among other things ensuring that all students parents educators and other stakeholders as appropriate relevant to teaching and learning have equitable sustainable access regardless of income to content tools and learning resources both and equitable access for parents is an important ideal but a task for schools and provides further evidence that other rttt unrelated to personalized learning should be pared to allow for important efforts like helping o we would urge the department to further spell out and address privacy implications of creating data systems that provide capability for parents and students to export their information in open data format what data will be exportable and how will it protected from a ferpa o an important infrastructure improvement that should be advanced this proposal is small class size which promotes attention and instruction efforts to decrease class size should explicitly encouraged and supported by this budget and we urge modification of the requirement that the applicant

secretary zero to three appreciates the opportunity to comment on the race to top district competition proposed guidelines zero to is to promote the healthy and positive development of infants toddlers particular those in the most vulnerable families the path later success in school and in life begins in the early years as foundations are laid for all later learning we believe officials have a large stake in community efforts to ensure that most young children receive early developmental support to minimize the gaps that emerge even before they reach therefore we are pleased that the eligibility criteria for district competition make clear that the early childhood period be covered in a local grant we offer a few suggestions for ensuring that any applicant choosing include services for younger children incorporates this age appropriately first it should be clear that when the early age group is included organizations can be partners the grant application not simply providing assurances that they been consulted while local education agencies leas in a instances fund services for very young children they very rarely providers of services to the age group including head start for children in the prekindergarten age also are most frequently provided by organizations addition as described below early childhood activities in which or schools might engage to enhance opportunities for the young feeding into their schools could include initiatives other than services which also would call for community we also urge that the application clearly delineate the between early childhood including the early elementary grades services for older children in the areas of developmentally curricula and teaching practices as well as evaluation and the various domains of physical social and inextricably related in young nurturing relationships in the early years support the emotional and social competence that provides the foundation for cognitive bricks and mortar for therefore we strongly recommend that applicants be required to that they will use a comprehensive curriculum for children in grade and younger that addresses all domains of development understanding of how learning in very young children is not instructed should be infused into professional opportunities for teachers working with the age the types of measurements used to determine progress for children above third grade as well as success for the schools attend are not appropriate for the early childhood period we urge that the application require assurances that assessments children in third grade and younger will conform with recommendations of the national academies of sciences reports on assessment and that such assessments will be used to improve practices and support the development of individual children not make decisions about program funding we also note that as above some activities related to early care and learning through these grants could be more and metrics should make room for other ways of assessing we are pleased with the inclusion of the competitive priority for integrating public and private resources which has potential to create strong partnerships between early childhood providers such partnerships could used as the umbrella under which activities to enhance early services could occur these activities could include initiatives than direct services such as community early childhood assessments facilitating the provision and on screening early developmental delays and disabilities or joint development we believe this potential for early childhood could be heightened by requiring a description of how the provided through the partnership will be shared and will enhance goals and activities described for the partnership in

suggested refocus from personalized learning to accelerating achievement all levels of students and cultivating academic focus should be on accelerating the performance of all including high needs students that does not necessarily mean that tasks are personalized or different in all situations but instead mean that rich high quality common tasks are used personalized scaffolding for all the existing focus on adapting to personal could be misleading an improvement is to say academic interests academic interests and academic perseverance solely adapting to kids personally enjoy doing is not likely to make a significant on learning overall the emphasis should be on tools producing substantial in shorter time periods acceleration rather than on a method as the outcome the focus should be on promoting a with defined requirements that encourages innovation to specifically in literacy ensure that personalized learning does exclude all students from having the opportunity to confront texts in math it should not prevent all students from engaging in careful sustained study of common problems as performing countries hone the metrics for effective and highly effective teachers requiring districts to report them separately change the measure teachers to whom students have daily access to teacher or teachers record where a teacher of record is defined by the evaluation explicitly identify technology as a force that can expand the of highly effective teachers and explicitly identify class size as a barrier that needs to be create a race by engaging an evaluation partner to refine yardsticks and by issuing an annual report card on the progress every district is making toward its goals it would be best if partner could embed data analysts in a representative number districts require districts to invest in their side of providing note that while the core measures will not change the specific may be refined to render them cheaper to execute more comparable more help create pressure on districts to do good things on the way application and provide a clearer guide to judges by awarding for policies identify highly effective teachers even if a more fully

just increase the class sizes responsibilities of highly teachers and compensate them for their additional labor shift resources in response to performance strengthening and expanding the reporting period for winners the grant data system requirements should be that districts not only track match but that they provide back data to teachers their supervisors on student achievement metrics should be tracked by the doe for five years rather in districts from states use to calculate percentiles on the state tests and report those districts should calculate the growth percentiles for each baseline score in the starting year of the grant as long as the did not change the tests the reporting partner could use those percentiles for measuring whether or not growth is in words the first year would ensure that the median student is a growth percentile of however in subsequent years that could rise if achievement is below are suggested revisions for individual sections in the include

httpaddr june re race to the top district draft dear secretary the naacp legal defense and educational fund inc ldf is pleased submit the following comments in response to the department ed executive summary of race to the top competition all children especially those from homes disabilities or with high needs must have the opportunity to schools with peers from different backgrounds feel safe and when in school and have equal access to teachers who and effective we know that ed is committed to goals and we offer the following comments to strengthen support the challenging and necessary work to make these goals the following comments focus on improving promoting reducing discipline rates and ensuring properly training and evaluating engaging parents and promoting through ed has a prime opportunity to promote diversity reduce racial isolation in schools the supreme court in involved in community schools v seattle school district and departments of justice and education in their joint guidance on voluntary use of race to achieve diversity and avoid racial in elementary and secondary schools continue to stand by the teaching of brown v board of education that diversity provides and important civic and educational benefits to students indeed highlighted diversity as one of its supplemental priorities discretionary grant programs announced by ed in december and you noted upon the release of joint guidance by the departments education and justice on promoting voluntary integration and efforts isolation remains far too common in classrooms today and it is increasing this denies our the experiences they need to succeed in a global economy employers and customers will be increasingly diverse also breeds educational inequity which is inconsistent with core yet despite this overwhelming support for school diversity there been no mention of reducing racial isolation or promoting through rtt or flexibility package notably in who attend schools are considered students but there is no emphasis within the guidelines address the racial isolation that imperils ed should call on leas to diversify schools and support this through priorities either as an absolute or preference as it suggested in its december federal notice furthermore we suggest that ed assess applications based part on how applicants propose to reduce racial isolation and diversity in schools within recipient districts ed should monitor the progress of recipient districts in reducing isolation and increasing diversity in schools affected by lastly for schools that need intervention the magnet school offers an effective method of addressing the twin goals of student academic performance and promoting diversity such should be included in the options supported through for around struggling in addition to these recommendations please note that we also the comments on race to the submitted by the coalition on school reducing discipline rates and in the executive summary ed requires grantee districts racial or disciplinary disparities to undergo assessment and develop a plan to address the root causes of disparities we applaud and strongly support this requirement disciplinary rates are double what they were in the despite overwhelming research on the academic social and fiscal of on exclusionary discipline and as suspension expulsion rates rise racial disparities in discipline only continue widen we see these elements of a pipeline incredibly damaging to our youth and deeply intertwined the same issues of access and fairness at play in brown we commend for addressing racial and disciplinary in to extend this benefit to more students we join our colleagues in dignity in schools campaign in urging ed to require not just but all applying districts to undertake a needs assessment and a plan to address disciplinary disparities the race to top competition required some states to make significant changes in and policy in order to apply for grant funds to the extent that ed committed to using competitive grant programs as a key lever for on matters affecting school pushout such a catalyst should be used aid students in districts that do not receive funding as furthermore we urge ed to require applying districts to set measurable benchmarks for reductions in disparities and to grantee districts with continued disparities to set aside percent of their remaining grant funds for implementation approaches to school requirement to the early intervening services provision of the individuals disabilities education act usc research shows implementing best practices that focus on inclusion rather exclusion from school as a method of discipline can result in academic performance student attendance and perceptions of please note that we fully endorse the comments submitted by the in schools campaign on race to the as ensuring eligibility we support focus on students from homes and those high needs however the requirement that of participating be from households is simply too low we fear that this threshold will fail to properly direct resources to the students and schools that desperately need the additional support urge ed to raise the minimum percentage of students from homes to be served by these reform funding disparities documented extensively in recent report comparability can hobble efforts to improve struggling schools applaud assessment of lea transparency described on page five the executive summary documenting funding disparities is a first step to addressing one of the persistent divides in education reporting however is not enough recipients must required to address these disparities by instituting policy that close the funding gaps and move the districts toward funding for all schools within their competitive though we fully support the proposed focus on students living poverty and students we must note our disagreement with the method for distributing funds through competitive funding by definition creates winners and losers it may be useful for spurring innovation competition is not a way provide equitable educational opportunity to all children if we hope to achieve equity in our education system funding proposed competitions such as should be distributed more equitably conditional incentives to leas and schools that commit to the measures noted in this properly training and evaluating equitable distribution of fully prepared and effective at the heart of any improvement of student performance is a that is able to support student learning to perform this work beginning teachers must be that is teachers have completed their training program prior to becoming to work effectively with students beginning on first day in the classroom unfortunately our most vulnerable typically have less access to such teachers despite a prohibition in title i of the no child left behind act of minority students and students from homes disproportionately taught by teachers who have not yet completed training and despite abundant research that indicates that become better with experience the latest civil rights data indicates that schools serving mostly students twice as likely to have teachers with one or two years of than are schools within the same district that serve mostly equitable provision of and effective teachers essential to providing every student an effective learning environment data regarding the improved provision of and effective teachers to all students especially from homes and with should be an indicator leas must monitor and report improvement in these areas toward goal of providing all students with equal access to the best and prepared teachers should be required of all applicants leas propose plans to increase the retention and development of these teachers should receive additional points on their teacher any discussion of teachers should also include evaluation we serious concerns with the descriptions of the evaluations that recipients will have to implement though we agree with the concept evaluating staff at every level of the lea hierarchy and using information to inform professional development and improved for students the description of the evaluations mandated by implies that the evaluations will focus on standardized test scores a significant factor in measuring performance of school and staff overreliance on these limited measures of student learning educator performance has already resulted in teaching to the test morale in teachers and school leaders and an alarming trend students being pushed out of school to artificially inflate performance data indeed powerful perverse incentives are created test score data is given too much emphasis in rather than overemphasizing the data that these assessments test score data should be part of a balanced and multifaceted to measuring school and lea staff performance such an approach entail equal weighting of many of the measures noted in the guidelines including observations parent and student surveys school climate data particularly for lea administrators and board members we suggest employing several measures that will a comprehensive view of performance such as school climate parent student surveys and feedback from lea staff and leadership addition to multiple indicators of student academic and to the extent that evaluation data is used to inform changes lea compensation systems we remain concerned about the possibility using test score data for awarding bonuses to staff so such systems have the potential to induce which the president has repeatedly decried unscrupulous tactics adopted by educators and district staff increase scores eg the cheating scandals in atlanta dc and other engaging parents and true reform requires a team effort to provide every child an opportunity to learn school lea and sea staff must be involved working together toward the same goal the requirement that seas elected leadership comment on the lea application is intended though the five day comment window is hardly sufficient an review of and commentary on an application given integral nature of sea and feedback the required review comment period should be longer similarly there should be a required review and comment period of equal length for stakeholders and parents the comment window for community and parents should precede the submission of the application such once feedback from the community and parents is incorporated into application the sea and elected leadership may then the we thank you for the opportunity to naacp legal defense and educational fund submitted by eric gonzalez on fri june vote vote thank you for this opportunity to comment on the race to the top district program i encourage the department to lower student minimum eligibility criteria to matched by lowering of the award amount for smaller leas as it stands now competition precludes many if not most rural districts and nearly public charter schools from they form however laudable these consortium take significant time to they are authentic and there is very little time to meaningful and truly aligned consortium of for example or schools or between a district and a a second and perhaps more important reason for lowering enrollment eligibility requirement is to create the opportunity more and deeper innovative efforts to personalize learning evidence suggests that the charter schools sector has pioneered disproportionate share of most compelling examples of innovation the last years why should a kipp circa or a carpe circa be rendered ineligible for the race to the top program this program is more likely to yield the lasting proof it seeks if it does not set arbitrary limits that preclude many of strongest potential a final reason to lower the minimum eligibility this program aims personalize learning to pioneer effective and innovative approaches provide each individual student with the learning pathway they the proposed minimum appears to be inconsistent with the of the program submitted by jon on fri june vote vote having seen the early interest in cradle to career work in houston as we are promoting it via all kids alliance i hope it wil central to the district race to the top but more important than the catchphrase are the elements all must have leadership skin in the game data informed decision built on continuous improvement protocols are essential and accountability is submitted by robert on fri june vote vote comments from america achieves on proposed race to the america achieves a nonprofit organization helping educators communities build outstanding educational systems to prepare student for success in college careers and citizenship the opportunity to submit comments on the draft race to competition guidelines to inform these we convened eight leading district and state superintendents and than a dozen national education experts to discuss how the could best drive transformational we are pleased that will build on the progress made by support for state and district policy reflected in state race to the top the redesigned teacher fund and other grant programs as well as nclb waivers to improvements in teaching and learning this competition can new resources on accelerating and deepening learning for students so that each student achieves rigorous college standards by catalyzing assessing and improving models of teaching and learning that are and steered ongoing analysis of data to determine the curricula technology and other supports that individual students need important opportunity built into this competition includes students to advance track and manage their own learning rigorous we recommend three sets of changes to help this initiative fulfill potential which are further detailed first we recommend communicating more clearly a required blend strategies a accelerating and deepening individual student learning to high common expectations through continuous improvement learning and instruction b personalizing student engagement the assessments of and supports to help individual students achieve exceed high specific academic personalization is an important frame for redesigning learning teaching but it is a means to an end the risk exacerbated by early stage of learning technologies uneven instructional capacity schools and the short time frame for completing this application that personalization could actually lower expectations and the rigor instruction especially for currently students that clearly not the intent and specific changes would help ensure competition accomplishes its real second we believe that aspects of the current draft especially limited district time and bandwidth to complete applications as well existing cultures of compliance risk driving applicants potential vendors towards using checklists to meet requirements instead the competition should support local design execution of a strong specific vision to accelerate deepen personalize learning in participating schools to help students and exceed high expectations by requiring that all components be aligned toward that vision and ambitious outcome for third the notice could better leverage the work needed supplement sustain and eventually expand the school work supported by this initiative one recommendation towards this end is to increase the maximum grant to detailed it is important to mitigate the risk of personalization inadequately defined and contextualized inadvertently expectations especially for students and communicate a blend of two primary a accelerating and deepening individual student learning to high common expectations through continuous of learning and instruction b personalizing student engagement the assessments of and supports to help individual students achieve exceed high specific academic expectations not but for each day week and instructional to do so we revising language in the absolute priority and selection to specifically reflect these requiring applicants to detail their plans for continuous improvement of and for equipping educators and students with needed capacity tools to modify and improve instruction to better accelerate deepen learning for each individual requiring applicants to describe their comprehensive and reform vision and a specific vision of accelerated personalized learning that ensures continuous improvement of to ensure applicants do not take a checklist approach to application requirements and to better accomplish the aims to a support local design and execution of a strong vision to accelerate deepen and personalize learning to help reach and exceed high expectations and b align all plan toward that vision we recommend the focus on dramatic improvements in student outcomes to meet exceed high expectations aligned to college and career standards the application should also clarify the definition expected implementation of college and career specifically that each student master rigorous content and demonstrate the ability to apply knowledge through setting teamwork critical thinking communication problem solving and other skills additionally application should clarify that the intent of this competition to create models of dramatic not incremental improvements those ensure that for relevant or illustrative schools subjects and programs of study applicants outline a specific vision of what accelerated deepened learning will look like to help students reach and high expectations applicants should describe how plan component is indispensable and aligned to this overall including how the organizational and human capacity will be to design and execute on this ask applicants to describe current and projected capacity needs how they will ensure adequate capacity to implement their ask districts to describe how they will drive and implement process for school classroom or instructional design demonstrates stakeholder and has a clear plan for educational model or instructional program for deepening and personalizing learning a process for management to that model and a vision and strategy for a culture that supports it the short application timeframe provide insufficient time for schools to fully thoughtful comprehensive redesign plans that are imaginative have ownership and support from teachers and other please allowing applicants to create a process such as a competition that provides adequate time structure criteria support to enable schools to craft or adapt classroom and designs that address the needs and vision outlined and create critical mass of schools achieving breakthrough outcomes for individual student this likely would lead to new or schools beginning implementation in the fall of the process could also match schools with partners that have in instruction school design change management culture human capital and reducing the long list of requirements in c and c of the guidelines and instead focus on evaluating how well describe new or redesigned schools and classrooms or a process create those and articulate an instructional vision including approach to continuous improvement of supports to help students reach high expectations strategies ensure excellence and equity for every student plans for management and culture shift and the way in which a school and classroom and each plan component aligns to vision and while the overall vision goals and alignment of these into integrated models would be even more important than components of a design schools should be asked to critical components such as continual assessment of what working and what is not that is available in a timely manner inform instruction leadership with clear vision instructional methods tools resources curriculum infrastructure provided to help students reach college standards supports for teachers to accelerated deeper and personalized learning including time collaboration student support services integrated or offered as a personalization approach not as separate competitive priority and rethinking of resources including roles and responsibilities budgets developing a process to judge an capacity and for leading this type of design competition to achieve the and vision as well as assess their plan for sustainability scalability to reach more students over explicitly linking design components with strategies for and supporting teachers and leaders who will make new models outcomes a reality teachers and principals need the skills and other tools eg data technology and time collaboration that will allow them to deliver on the promise new instructional classroom and school models the should require applicants to articulate how they will ensure their human capital management system is or will be ready to that challenge a significant number of points should be to this portion of ensuring that required performance metrics reinforce the and related design principles that are at the remove student and teacher survey provide measures grouped by school level to ensure metrics across a range of for high school measures include persistence outcome modify performance measures regarding student access to educators to specify only the percentage of teachers record who are highly remove the personalized learning plan adjust the application to better leverage the needed to supplement sustain and eventually expand the school classroom level work to be supported by this initiative to student outcomes to accomplish this the department ensure that districts describe how local and state policies enable the success of redesigned classrooms and schools should include a description of any current requirements policies eg seat time carnegie units from which schools be released to enable innovative design models as well as policies practices or expectations that will be established accomplish the request that districts describe sustainability and scale showing how new school and classroom models will reach students over time consider allowing a approach to the full target of participating students over the grant instead of serving at least students in year adjust size of grant awards to better reflect the needs of smallest and largest the variability proposed award sizes for districts with to potentially over participating students is small the proposed sizes for small districts may exceed what is necessary and could difficult for small districts to sustain after the award cycle competition should allow for greater variability in award size awards for smaller districts reduced to million and to million for larger although the percent poverty threshold in participating may be a reasonable minimum districts proposing to serve higher levels of students through this should be advantaged or discard or deemphasize provisions that are outside of control and or not essential to the implementation the desired outcomes these include eligibility requirements for p data system as well as union sign off and teacher for the plan these could be included as criteria offering more points to those district able to higher levels of replace the requirement for personalized learning plans with description of how systems and schools will track student progress and use that information to provide instruction and support needed to reach or exceed expectations requiring personalized learning plans could lead bureaucratic paperwork and detract from the transformation teaching and replace the proposed competitive priority the competitive on comprehensive student and family supports seems from broader reforms although many students require added to achieve high academic outcomes providing academic supports to students and families could incorporated into a thoughtful school and district design as approach to personalization alternate competitive priorities

districts in building on state policies design fundamentally new models of teaching and learning that achieve dramatic gains for every child in terms of the knowledge skills necessary for success in college and career in addition to drivers of this redesign such as personalization growing evidence experience tell us that many kids in poverty a core target of program cannot achieve these gains without express attention their underlying social and emotional needs and that with integrated supports all students can succeed at high levels the notice acknowledges this by establishing a competitive around additional student and family supports but the current is not fully defined in sum we recommend that the priority be moved into the selection criteria as part of a redesign strategy that each district should address in its context the description of these supports be revised to more fully best all students need social emotional and cognitive competencies succeed in school and schools must have foundational conditions teaching and learning the experience of safety connectedness support and academic challenge and engagement in order to development of those competencies for example success depends on executive functioning and their ability to attend concentrate and work in groups similarly students learn and achieve more they are physically and socially safe because the experience anxiety for example compromises working memory students who emotionally and physically safe are more productive in class and correlates with many of the children who are the focus of the program come school without these competencies face many adversities and schools that are not adequately designed or prepared to support teaching and learning the challenges of poverty disrupt development and compromise their ability to understand and manage emotions and relationships in ways that will lead to school and success the outward signs of this disruption take varied predictable forms from distraction to dysfunction and development inevitably interferes with ability to fully the work of childhood and progress in school successfully while adversities of poverty are powerful in their own right they are exacerbated for students with disabilities and those who are language the current draft begins to address these barriers to and development by including a competitive priority that addresses challenges facing chronically underperforming schools in communities the proposal could be further strengthened by making competitive priority a core requirement if the cannot be changed adding specificity to the nature of social emotional provided and the metrics that should collected would be an important step in bringing these kinds practices to a successful model must directly address effects development and the ways it can compromise their ability attend to learning and their ability to instruct hence the requirements should call for approaches that address and emotional learning the quality of supports provided to and the competency and motivation of all adults in a school building address in their daily practice the cognitive social and needs and development of all as rtt moves into being a district initiative it is important establish the expectation that schools intentionally adapt and build capacity to meet the challenges that children living adversity bring with them to school should address the that learning and student support are absent inadequate in many schools that conditions for teaching and are poor in many schools and that principals and typically lack the skills to deal effectively with the challenges in to do this should in its core requirements not just as competitive priority address all critical elements of school that can drive student achievement a culture with high expectations for achievement student proficiencies in social persistence toward goals and a broadened definition of teacher competency that proficiencies in instructional practice student engagement social and emotional learning and development an adequate capacity for academic and supports and interventions for students in only by addressing these elements can schools and districts effective policies and an infrastructure capacity and culture enables teachers teacher teams and school leaders to focus on improving individual

martin and mr there is a continuing clear and compelling need for racially and socioeconomically diverse education for all across the country advocates continue to struggle against the of schools

compelling interest by the us court in parents involved in community schools v seattle district no us and the december memoranda guidance on the voluntary use of race to achieve and avoid racial isolation in elementary and secondary schools guidance on the voluntary use of race to achieve diversity postsecondary education by contrast schools inordinately expensive to maintain and improve due in part to difficulty of attracting and retaining effective teachers to environments it is thus troubling that the guidelines omit incentives that promote racially and socioeconomically schools a core component of a the proposal emphasizes education improving schools without the necessary parallel promoting racial and socioeconomic diversity on a school or level this limited approach can encourage districts to students in schools and programs apply remedial resources instead of creating the schools and classrooms that produce the best learning environment all students the current proposal incentivizes such a approach as it allows leas to apply for subject area including lowest performing schools feeder patterns and subjects and rather than undermine own core educational assurance areas all of which require that a district guard against the harms of and socioeconomic isolation and call into question the commitment to achieving diversity the guidelines should aligned with these absolute priorities to incentivize racially and socioeconomically diverse a eligibility the eligibility criteria should explicitly require an lea demonstrate a commitment to racially socioeconomically diverse education at the district school classroom level the department should also eliminate measures could bar counties serving the neediest students from accessing race the top desegregation orders and title vi to further discourage racial isolation the creation of schools and the marginalization of populations the should carefully scrutinize applications from leas with an desegregation order or a title vi complaint though these should not be ineligible from participating in race to the top department should ensure that the applicants do not allocate in a way that further marginalizes populations by comment from title vi complainants and parties in the litigation especially for dual district applicants the should solicit comments from private or government plaintiffs on record of eliminating the vestiges of segregation require evidence that the proposal will be in fulfilling its affirmative duty to effect on small the requirement that leas with less than students may apply

additional input should required community stakeholders must be given an opportunity comment on the school application packet in order to meaningful public participation in the process the department mandate a comment period for suggestions cautions and even from any affected stakeholder concerned with the record priorities and prospects for engaging and serving populations once a district develops records anticipated by the program requirements they must be open not only the department and its research partners but to any interested through foia the abbreviated comment period for this proposal exemplifies appears to be the discounting of meaningful public the comment period was shortened to two weeks and is limited online comments only thereby depriving key stakeholders of notice

strategy that promotes both and group applicants should be required to include the amount of time for teacher professional program requirements the grant size should be reduced as replication and will

emotional o refraining from substance abuse including alcohol tobacco and o maintaining school engagement without high truancy and drop out o cultivating strong relationships with caring and

engage with you on this important look forward to continuing the hayling policy national collaboration for submitted by hayling on fri june vote vote i agree with the comment in submitted by capricia on fri june vote vote healthy schools have diverse populations school districts should rewarded with grants if the school board puts a cap on each school it is not overwhelmed with too many low achievement kids for no more than below grade level at each school so our teachers not overburdened so all our schools can strive to be balanced and we can give each child the attention and resources every child deserves a good what makes a good good teachers make excellent schools in a perfect world the teachers would teach in the lowest performing schools the best teachers want to teach in the high poverty there are more issues to deal with kids who afford to pay for school lunch for grades k for grades probably afford a home they may not have a quiet place to do their homework or someone help them do their homework or maybe have dinner the before or have parents who are struggling to work two jobs to ends meet in the higher income schools more parents have time volunteer in the schools and raise lots of money selling paper golf tournaments etc for supplies computers special appreciation lunches wake county nc schools have had an excellent reputation for the years because they had a diversity policy they have repealed that policy please make diversity in schools a priority by making that a requirement for the race to the submitted by rita on fri june vote vote the foundation for community education would like to register support for the race to the top program many of the contained in the program description have the potential to make positive changes in the way we approach teaching and learning there one issue we would like to address in the description of how program will be implemented at the lea level you can find references to engaging parents and the community community are strong advocates for engagement and have been for many years references to involving parents and community have been showing up the proposal guidelines for program sponsored by the department education for many of those years the problem often encountered implementation is that there is often no one in a school or who has the training and major assignment in facilitating engagement of parents and community it is often a matter described school leaders as well this is job in our unfortunately job turns into no the number one suggestion is to make sure parent and engagement is not just a window dressing element in the program that leas are held accountable for the successful engagement of parents and key members of the community we know that there research that has established a correlation between parent and student success but time and time again this activity gets aside for coffee and cookies meetings that do not result in active involvement in their learning there are also members of community who care about education and have resources have great potential for having a positive impact on teaching second we would like to recommend that leas participating in the to the top program employ a member of the leadership team who expertise in working with parents and community members to provide variety of useful activities that will bring greater success to educational progress of our last suggestion is to require that an effective assessment be of the engagement of parents and thank you for providing us with this forum for sharing our thoughts this stephen r parson president the community education submitted by stephen parson on fri june vote vote several organizations who are members of the national coalition school diversity submitted this letter today to secretary urging a priority for race to the top district proposals that school diversity and reduction of racial isolation as part of educational reform dear secretary on behalf of the undersigned organizations and individuals quality racially and economically integrated education we these comments in response to the draft executive summary of the requirements priorities selection criteria and definitions for race to the top district competition for the department of race to the top district competition our primary concern is that proposed standards overlook the continuing importance of racial and economic segregation in public schools and voluntary school integration we recognize that the notice and website is set up to solicit informal comments but we believe the omission of school diversity criteria from the new notice merits more formal the importance of promoting integration and avoiding racial has been reaffirmed as a compelling government interest by justices of the us supreme court in parents involved in schools v seattle school district and by the department itself its december guidance on the voluntary use of race to diversity and avoid racial isolation in elementary and schools issued jointly with the us department of justice yet acknowledged federal interest in diversity and reduction of isolation is altogether absent from the draft standards for the race the top district competition we recognize the challenges in and maintaining racial and economic diversity however we believe it is inappropriate to use federal money to perpetuate racial economic isolation in our public schools at the very least federal funds should incentivize local efforts to promote we made this same point in in response to the notice of priorities requirements definitions and selection criteria for department of original race to the top fund asking diversity to be included as a priority it did not appear in the rule nor has it appeared in any of the race to the top funding since then however the need for diversity in our schools has grown more salient in his speech at the edmund pettus bridge selma alabama secretary duncan discussed the importance of in education both broadly and as it had benefited him stating policies which stunt healthy diversity are bad for children and odds with the american dream and committing that the department embark on a revitalized mission to increase the fairness and equity the december guidance on the voluntary use of race to diversity and avoid racial isolation in elementary and schools further emphasizes this priority stating that racially schools provide incalculable civic and educational benefits students and that schools lacking in racial diversity may fail provide the full panoply of benefits that k schools can offer guidance clarifies that schools and districts can lawfully school diversity and gives examples of methods that can be used achieve diversity the department in this new competitive round should be soliciting innovative educational approaches achieve this goal there is no reason for the department to divorce concept of educational reform from the compelling need for diversity in fact the two can and should go hand in furthermore the supplemental priorities for grant programs published in december affirmatively permit department to provide a funding preference for projects designed promote student diversity including racial and ethnic diversity avoid racial isolation in order to promote understanding break down racial stereotypes and prepare students an increasingly diverse workforce and society given this approval of diversity as a source of preference for federal money the department should in its nofa utilize a priority for diversity to encourage voluntary integration consistent with the of the guidance such a priority would not be unprecedented student diversity and avoiding racial isolation are competitive preference priorities albeit very weak for funded charter school under the new race to the top funding round leas and regional of leas are in an optimal position to effectively promote they can institute school district and policies foster a diverse student body can monitor levels of diversity at and the and can act dynamically address the unique issues that arise in balancing the importance diversity with the difficulty of satisfactorily achieving it recognized in the december guidance leas are often in the role to build a diverse student population in american schools from bottom given the unique opportunity for the competition to target compelling goal of diversity at the ground level we urge that final notice reflect the goal of supporting racial and integration in public schools we suggest that the statement of and each section of the nofa reflect this commitment and that priority is placed on applications whose proposals similarly this commitment otherwise the importance of reducing racial economic isolation of disadvantaged students of color as part of overall school reform strategy is likely to be overlooked both applicants and by us doe proposal in accordance with these general comments we recommend the additions to the as an absolute priority a competitive preference priority or proposed invitational priority the department should add approaches to voluntary school integration and school transfers to promote integration this could include example large leas encouraging transfer and programs to promote integration and small leas applying interdistrict consortia or demonstrating evidence of cooperation encouraging transfer programs to integration building on the experience of successful programs in areas across the country including boston st louis hartford core educational assurance areas should include as a fifth area goal of creating a racially and socioeconomically diverse environment for under eligibility criteria we suggest the addition of the two criteria these are already likely obvious to many doe grantees practice however these principles are often the proposal by the lea or consortium of leas will attempt ameliorate and not increase school based poverty concentration racial isolation in the schools affected by the the lea or consortium of leas may not use these federal funds create new racially concentrated or high poverty program requirements should include language supporting school integration efforts the department should require applicant to include in its application an analysis of how its will utilize both the federal funds and its local resources knowledge of ongoing circumstances to increase decrease racial and economic isolation and segregation of students the jurisdiction applying for selection criteria b a high quality plan should include description of how the district has demonstrated evidence of a plan successfully address the racial and economic isolation of students the jurisdiction applying for funds priority should be given proposals with demonstrated evidence that the district has the will capacity to encourage voluntary racial and socioeconomic within the school and classroom in particular weight should be to applicants who have demonstrated how their plan will capitalize resources and knowledge to increase student through school transfer programs attendance or other innovative selection criteria c performance measurement should as a measure the extent to which the applicant has established ambitious yet achievable annual targets for decreasing the racial economic isolation of students one measure of how well applicant has so established might be the quality of school transfer program selection criteria d transition plan and continuous should include the extent to which the applicant has a plan increasing the racial and socioeconomic diversity within schools classrooms and for decreasing the racial and socioeconomic of students in the schools grades or subgroups receiving funds in particular plans should provide for how the leas implement their school transfer programs to balance the efficacy of diversity goal with the potential for require that each lea implement data collection and a plan to conditions of racial isolation for students data should include longitudinal data pertaining to individual performance for ethnic majority and minority students transfer neighborhood students and students of high middle and thank you for the opportunity to present these comments please let know if you need additional information we would be happy to

to the top district dear secretary in response to the may edgov blog post the mexican legal defense and educational fund maldef submits the comments to the proposed priorities selection criteria definitions that the united states department of education department outlines to carry out the newly announced race to the district founded in maldef is the leading latino legal rights organization often described as the law firm of the community maldef promotes social change through legislative regulatory advocacy community education and high impact litigation the areas of employment immigrant rights political access education intent here is to encourage the department develop final requirements that help districts innovate and the rates of latino students graduating career and including those that are english language learners ell students and immigrant maldef sees promise in the of this federal program given that substantial numbers of students latino students failed to benefit from earlier race the top rtt efforts for example of the twelve states that won and awards only two have latino student populations that meet exceed the national proportion of latino students in united schools see education trust student demographics in rttt states aug consequently while the twelve states represent percent of the students they only serve percent of the latino students of the five states with highest density ell enrollment arizona california new nevada and texas only arizona succeeded in winning rtt during a comparatively smaller award see migration policy states and districts with the highest number and share of language learners moreover of the five states with the migrant student populations california texas florida and oregon only florida won rtt on balance appears to be a positive evolution of the rtt that the department has championed maldef encourages the however to use the here to proactively reach districts found within states particularly those sizable subgroup populations including racial and ethnic ells and migrant students to this end maldef offers the suggestions to strengthen the proposed priorities and o absolute priority personalized learning environment criteria maldef believes the department can and should do more ensure equitably reaches latino students across the school districts while the proposed reach of will likely new districts that the previous rtt efforts did not the criteria for is less detailed than rtt or even the no child behind nclb flexibility waiver applications currently this lesser prescriptive approach appears to be tied to encouraging development of innovative personalized teaching and learning models promote college and outcomes a personalized teaching learning environment is one every child deserves and we applaud goal the concern for maldef however remains that with greater autonomy many recipients may find themselves serving students and not all students or even those students with greatest need given local political pressures or greater engagement by certain parent sectors over o recommendation while applicant districts may apply for all a portion of their schools for specific grades or for bands they must assure in part that at students are served and at least percent of students are from families maldef recommends that ensure that an additional percentage of the or more served be ell special education and migrant students commitment to ell and special education students evident within the waiver application process it appears however not be present here in the context moreover the regarding ells and students with disabilities should be corrected expanded to also factor in migrant students the future lessons to learned from the experience should proactively account for personalized teaching and learning models can and should reach with unique learning needs like ell special education and students now is the time to require that districts schools grades and bands that reach all subgroups not just o absolute priorities and rural leas in rtt states and states maldef commends the department for prioritizing rural from rural latino enrollment increased by nationally and in some of the most rural states has increased four and five fold see the rural school and trust why rural matters jan much of this growth in rural areas includes ell and migrant students and for many these rural districts this is the first time they have latino families and students the measure of innovation in districts should be to account for newcomer present in those o recommendation the department should require rural applying for funds to demonstrate how they will improve performance for ells and migrant o selection criteria review of the selection section does not disclose any affirmative check for whether applicant district is in compliance with current civil rights laws that they are affirmatively engaging parents and other representing all student subgroup interests caution here is whereas the waiver applicant states had an affirmative obligation engage community based organizations and civil rights many of them failed to carry persuade the larger public they did so the department nevertheless approved many applicants regardless of these deficits now is the time to avoid similar negative result with o recommendation maldef encourages the department to add a consultation requirement and hold applicant districts to carry burden with demonstrable evidence of such stakeholder engagement example under of the selection criteria section letters support from such key stakeholders the department should add b letters of support from such key stakeholders as parents parent organizations early learning programs the business civil rights organizations advocacy groups that represent language learners special education students and migratory local civic and organizations institutions higher education moreover maldef requests that the department add a more assurance requirement that an applicant district is not engaged impermissible discrimination one place to capture such a civil compliance assurance might be selection criteria section the extent to which the lea and school infrastructure personalized learning which could be amended to i ensuring that all participating students parents educators other stakeholders as appropriate and relevant to and learning have equitable and sustainable access regardless income race ethnicity gender disability english language status migratory status or other protected categories to tools and other learning resources both and o competitive preference priority results resource alignment integrated services latino and african american students are overrepresented in the worst performing schools students that percent of latinos and nearly half of african american high schools where graduation is not the norm see ucla civil project historic reversals accelerating resegregation and the for new integration strategies aug not schools are five times more likely to have weak power which correlates with high dropout rates see o recommendation we join the june recommendations of alliance for educational excellence concerning dropout recovery early warning indicator and intervention systems maldef too the department to add a second competitive preference priority focuses on districts that present persuasive plans to create factor in early warning indicators of weak promotion power at middle school level and dropout issues at the high school level personalize interventions to put those students at risk of out back on track the premise of is to foster innovation proceed without fostering innovation around persistent dropout seems shortsighted and o definitions the definitions section defines all use of subgroups in the program under the narrowest definition subgroups section economically students students from major racial and ethnic groups with disabilities and students with limited english proficiency under nclb yet an applicant vision success preparation for college and careers results alignment and integrated services cannot and should not be without affirmatively factoring in gender equity and the needs migratory students the two major student subgroups excluded section but factored in under other portions nclb including section and o recommendation maldef encourages the department to apply the subgroup definitions inclusive of gender and migratory wherever possible in the program requirements selection criteria and o selection teams and transparency maldef commends the department factoring in peer reviewers for waiver applications who knowledgeable on the needs of ells and students with disabilities encourage the department to tap its resources to similarly ensure the selection table for the awards has seats for those expertise in ell education special education and migrant education also in keeping with the commitment transparency with waiver applications maldef also encourages department to take steps to inject transparency into how districts are thank you for your time and attention to these matters please do hesitate to reach dc office if you have any questions or mexican american legal defense and educational fund washington submitted by maldef on fri june vote vote regarding the the lack of any priority for proposals that increase diversity and avoid racial isolation in schools we education reform and encouragement of diversity in schools as that can and should go i am the first vice president of the minsters conference of salem nc and vinicity and we as a body of ministers have been on the issue of the changing demographics from more diverse setting to more segregated setting it is amazing to us that over years ago the supreme court found that separate but equal to not be the most effective means of the educating all children now we find research case after case revealing that separating by race still yields poor rests when it come to profficiency in a most recent study it has been confirmed teachers impact the performance of the student by their atitudes behaviors in the classroom and the combination of segregated and poor teacher influence make for to disasterous results for school conclusion local school systems should not be left to their decisions alone but should have mandated and enforced goals from us department of education for diversity and academic performance all schools current school systems do not and can not produce effective education plan

no review of the of the proposed plan or its potential fiscal impact the application should make clear that any implementation problems delays will be considered the sole responsibility of the grantee and all solutions to such problems will be negotiated between the district and the us department of the application should require that districts provide an for public comment on their application consistent with the meeting laws of their state to ensure that there is sufficient for review at the local level this will help identify conflicts with existing local policies and agreements and

hopes to see in forthcoming rtt applications including personalized learning plans for all the ability to track and monitor individual and collective results and the delivery of more engaging and empowering learning view on the importance of technology to personalized learning is reflected in the conclusion of a report issued by the ascd council of chief state school officers and the software industry association personalized learning requires not only a in the design of schooling but also a leveraging of technologies personalization cannot take place at scale technology personalized learning is enabled by smart systems which help dynamically track and manage the learning needs all students and provide a platform to access myriad engaging content resources and learning opportunities needed to meet students needs everywhere at anytime but which are not all within the four walls of the traditional in our review of the rttd draft application documents we noted they did not contain as a clear a link between technology personalized learning something we believe is warranted and while the term digital learning content appears in selection c preparing students for colleges and careers and receives definition the term technology only appears a few times and no definition thus it is unclear whether the very devices equipment that are supposed to deliver digital content are eligible support in this competition while we understand the interest in allowing to use a variety of tools technology and oriented we are concerned that the of explicit references to technology and the absence of a definition technology within the final application may lead applicants to that the department does not support or perhaps disfavors as a component of their therefore

regarding the elements of the race to the the provision for educator involvement in developing a application for an grant does not go far enough as applied states such as texas first though texas lack collective bargaining per se for school employees the of by the local president should be explicitly to situations where local district policy has formal consultation mechanisms with a representative organization negotiating on behalf of all employees in the unit addition the requirement of evidence of support from percent educators involved should be modified to require specifically that least this level of support be demonstrated by while this proposal sets a laudable goal of developing individualized instruction plans it undercuts achievement of that goal by incorporating the overly requirements of the sig program and the race to the model especially regarding options and evaluation based largely on an impoverished measure of achievement derived from scores on state assessments see texas prior comments on regulations implementing sig and rttt the should be modified to encourage other possible improvement models as community schools and the requirements regarding teacher should be altered to state achievement tests there is substantial evidence of the effectiveness of programs meeting mandatory and design criteria on state standardized assessments both our state and federal accountability systems already has had effect of dumbing down instruction narrowing curriculum encouraging the very approaches that the of education professes to the proposal also fails to take into account the constraints affecting school capacity to implement all the many facets of the proposal for example from already inadequate base level of funding texas school districts in current biennium have suffered budget cuts averaging than per pupil per year with serious detrimental effects educational opportunity for a major urban district such houston isd the maximum grant at million per pupil would not even begin to make up lost state aid for a single year yet as experts from the teacher advancement program have testified in the texas effective implementation of just one piece of what new model of teacher evaluation and as much as a year per pupil in targeted additional expenditures a sustained basis year after texas aft continues to have a fundamental objection to the race the top approach this competitive approach guarantees that millions children in districts that do not receive rtt grants will lose out vital programs and services instead of using these competitive to promote unproven programs the department of education should to ensure that teachers in every classroom have the tools and conditions for teaching and learning that they and their need to be submitted by eric hartman on fri june vote vote public impact an education research and consulting appreciates the opportunity to comment on the draft guidelines for race to the top district competition we are pleased to see points in the guidance that encourage districts to expand access to highly effective teachers the department is most likely accomplish the aims of race to the top if districts find ways sustainably extend excellent reach to more students in process districts will open up a wide array of opportunities teachers who have achieved excellence to have more impact both and by leading and developing other teachers toward creating what we call an opportunity culture in addition believe as many do that more teachers could achieve excellence they had far more direction and plentiful frequent feedback from who have mastered the art of excellence in we respectfully submit three comments all designed to focus on enhancing excellent improve performance measure related to number of students highly effective teachers we strongly support the inclusion of measure of the number and percentage of students with access highly effective teachers this new metric encourages districts think not just about how many teachers are highly effective also how to extend their impact to more students we recommend changes to strengthen the focus on excellence and the likely on students rationales a the metric should be narrowed to reporting the number percentage of students who are taught by highly effective alternately the metric should ask districts to report effective and highly effective is one set measures for effective and one for highly effective alternative may be the intention of the existing clarification of two distinctly reported categories would ensure that this intent is b instead of measuring daily access to teachers the should track the number and percentage of students whose of record in the teacher evaluation system are rationale for a while good solid teachers produce much outcomes than the least effective teachers in approximately top produce enough learning gains on average for students start behind to catch up in a reasonable and motivating period even with a teacher roughly in the middle of the quartile by some estimates it takes two consecutive years for child who is one year behind grade level in a subject to catch and four consecutive years for a child who is two years behind catch up students working at grade level need similar gains become honors this kind of progress from beginnings at birth to that exceeds those beginnings is the foundational hope of education without aiming for consistent access to excellence no school or district can provide a opportunity to large numbers of rationale for b daily access is both too loose and too of a standard it is too loose because access does not mean highly effective teacher is actually responsible for a learning arguably all of a students have access to given teacher at that school this form of the metric would likely lead to meaningful increases in great teaching for daily access is also too tight because some of the school models that use blended learning involve approaches such having students alternate days with a teacher one day and in digital lab the next or having a remotely located teacher who not be physically accessible despite full accountability learning and strong frequent personal connection using webcams online in place of daily access we suggest linking this metric to teacher evaluation systems the district winners will be required have under the terms counting the number percentage of students whose teachers of record in each subject in those systems are highly effective both the and teachers of record then will be motivated to select means extending each highly effective reach that are likely work with the specific teacher and students in a given school record becomes professionally valuable to can pursue opportunities to help more students peer teachers based on it becomes in interest extend reach one complication this introduces is how to count students who more than one would be the case with all students and some elementary students the most accurate and approach would be to calculate for such students the proportion their teachers in designated subjects who are highly effective the event that designated subjects are not defined in other of the guidance we suggest that they be defined by each but must include all english language arts ela and math elementary students and ela math science and social studies secondary students we suggest that the department districts to measure excellence in other subjects as well include those teachers in the career advancement opportunities become available when teachers can extend their reach so example if a student had teachers in designated subjects and were highly effective this student would count as in the of the number of students with highly effective reward plans for expanding access to highly teachers because expanding access to the most effective is part of the absolute priority the should ask districts to present a plan for this example as part of the current section c specifically districts should be awarded points presenting plans that specify how schools implement designs change staff roles school schedules the use technology in ways that increase the number of students teachers of record in designated subjects are highly enable highly effective teachers to earn more for reaching students as the teacher of are financially sustainable with current funding covering temporary transitional costs specify the new means by which teachers who have not highly effective status can increase their the application should allow districts to meet this criterion presenting specific school designs that qualify or by processes by which existing or new schools will compete for opportunity to devise and implement qualifying reward policy conditions for expanding impact of highly teachers the competition should award points to districts putting into place a variety of that important to enable highly effective teachers to reach students among the most important districts should receive if their policies and their policies that govern enable identification of highly effective teachers even if more fully developed teacher evaluation system is not yet place no limits on increasing class sizes of highly teachers voluntarily and for increased pay proportional to increased class enable highly effective teachers to earn higher pay than regular salary schedule for reaching more students permit paraprofessional staff to monitor students during instructional time provided that the teacher of is an effective or highly effective teacher this is important enable blended learning without diminishing the critical role adults who are accountable for learning thank you again for the opportunity to

identification of the primary and math teachers for students in middle and high school grades who rotate among teams of teachers for various subjects following of such a data system districts would require at least three school years to validate the links and pilot component of a multiple measures evaluation system utilizing such data to inform personnel in addition to the technical data system

another program but comprehensive restructuring and transformation based on and school system capacity competencies public will and trust in democratic public education network and its members welcome the opportunity speak more with you or your staff about how we can help you reach goal for accomplishing the wendy d puriefoy president and public education submitted by arnold f fege on fri june vote vote june the honorable arne us department of maryland ave washington dc dear mr ascd representing more than educators appreciates opportunity to comment on the notice of proposed priorities criteria and definitions for the race to the top district competition we support the efforts to districts to personalize teaching and learning encourage them provide differentiated instruction and require them to devise implement effective we have several recommendations and questions that we hope will addressed prior to posting the final selection the competition draft applicants to delineate a vision that will translate into improved student performanceas demonstrated by several indicators however the only indicators listed are those that to college readiness we hope that the department does not intend indicate a preference for college readiness over career preparation recognize that both are legitimate paths for high school graduates many students the measure of success after high school graduation certainly be acceptance to and enrollment in college however for more students success will be employment and indicators should also be reflected in the vision an additional measure required in the vision statement performance on summative assessments college career citizenship readiness are not limited to proficiency on standardized reading and math tests but they include all and the comprehensive knowledge and skills required of students high school graduation challenging curriculum across all content areas is essential for college and civic preparation accordingly curriculum and instruction in areas must demonstrate high expectations for students and strategies measuring student achievement in all content areas would provide a more comprehensive picture of and growth thus we recommend broadening the performance required in the vision statement to include multiple measures student achievement in all core academic subjects including but limited to subject areas in which statewide summative exist as well as requiring districts and schools to publicly student achievement in core subjects however it is measured collected at those college and standards we applaud the requirement applicants adopt standards and assessments that prepare students succeed in college and the workplace and to compete in the economy as part of the core educational assurance areas ascd high standards for students educators and schools a curriculum and high standards are the means by which our children receive a education enabling them to compete in our the current definition of college and standards in draft executive summary provides two types of acceptable standards is that states may use standards that are approved by a state of institutions of higher education we would appreciate about whether this needs to be a discrete and affirmative of the standards by the state network of institutions of education the question arises if the institutions of higher in a state network are members of the national collegiate association ncaa which requires adherence to the initial eligibility requirements for prospective student these requirements are intended to ensure that students can handle rigors of college coursework and thus be considered ready initial eligibility criteria include a certification students have satisfactorily met the secondary courses necessary for graduation would a state membership the ncaa and application of its initial eligibility requirements sufficient to meet the certification of standards evaluations ascd supports rigorous but fair evaluations for and school leaders any evaluation of a effectiveness must based on a combination of inputs including but not limited student performance classroom observations and parental feedback addition such evaluations must be used for improvement and professional growth evaluations for teachers school leaders should include valid clearly defined and performance standards and rubrics school leader evaluations also be based on demonstrated leadership skills including providing clear school vision and direction implementing rigorous curriculum related activities and supporting a culture of collaboration and professional the executive summary definitions of teacher and evaluation systems should reflect all of these components particular differentiating between those components relevant teachers from those relevant to school the teacher and principal evaluation system definitions identify on student growth for all students as a significant factor in evaluation criteria we recommend language to ensure that performance or student growth constitutes not more than percent this the proposed superintendent and school board evaluations are to reflect student outcomes performance rather than the growth language in the teacher and principal evaluations aligning the language in the four evaluation requirements clearer guidance to districts as they develop these evaluation there is significant variance between student growth and outcomes performance the latter of which could be construed to only testing results in reading and math in any case we would urge the department to ensure that this component does not more than percent of the evaluation of superintendents and personalized learning ascd is pleased with the strong focus personalized learning directing districts to differentiate to meet the needs of each child ascd believes that a approach to learning recognizes that successful young people knowledgeable emotionally and physically healthy safe and cared motivated civically inspired engaged in the arts prepared for and economic and ready for the world beyond their borders together these elements support the development of a who is healthy safe engaged supported and challenged given recognition by the department of personalized learning as paramount student success as demonstrated by this proposed grant competition belief ascd shares we recommend that the department similarly personalized learning by requiring its inclusion in school strategies promoted by the effective integration of student supports in the school environment crucial to supporting the whole child we are heartened that competitive preference priority would require districts to address behavioral and other needs of important components of meeting the needs of the whole child thus recommend that the department consider making the integrated option part of the core educational assurance areas to ensure that services that districts provide to students are coordinated delivered in a way that supports the whole teaching ascd strongly supports the requirements with to teaching effective teaching is the number one indicator of success empowering educators to become effective in their role enabling them to implement personalized teaching and learning for students is an important step toward improved student achievement success after ascd has been a advocate of a whole child approach education for each child in each school in each personalized learning strategies that best meet and support individual needs are an essential component of a whole education we are gratified and commend the us department education for recognizing and promoting the importance of learning as reflected in this competition proposal true success and effective school reform are dependent upon an system that recognizes the individual needs of each accommodates the diversity of the school and the community it and offers worthy educational opportunities for everyone we forward

the proposal personalized learning strategies with the maximum involvement and ownership of the public promoting outcomes that recognize the importance of linking school and in changing the capacity and culture of the district this allows districts and communities to concentrate efforts on authentic student achievement and away from passing fits all models and mandates without recognizing differentiated needs of various communities and their students major regret is that there will only be a few districts that grants rather than providing the resources to all districts that the

struggled to produce excellence and equity all children to personalized approaches to and learning that will use collaborative strategies st century tools to deliver instruction and supports tailored to add academic social and emotional needs of each student with goal of enabling all students to graduate college and eligibility rural school we are concerned about the requirement that applicants must meet threshold of serving a minimum of students while consortia district and long distance learning are promising strategies there a cost in personnel bringing communities together and face to planning in developing consortia that may make such challenging if not prohibitive for small and very poor districts we have a lot to learn from the approximately percent the rural school districts that would be excluded from this oour goal recommendation is to set aside funding that is discretionary to meet these needs offer special and personal assistance in helping smaller communities in meeting logistical prescriptions in applying for size culture history and context can have an impact on everything effect size conditions for learning opportunities funding middle and high school as a result of inadequate preparation during secondary school million students do not graduate each year and in nearly schools fewer than sixty percent of students graduate low performing high schools and their feeder middle must be reformed without losing the systemic focus on a continuum education from cradle to career it is critical that middle and schools preparing students for graduating and transitioning postsecondary education receive focused attention within a competitive preference priority should be given to that focus their reform efforts on low performing middle and schools serving large proportions of low income the requirement that at least forty percent of students must be from families should be raised to at fifty percent for all eligible applicants and a competitive priority should be set for applicants serving more than fifty in addition poverty at the secondary school level should be accurately measured by requiring the use of a feeder application the draft application requirements should include appropriate focus on personalization and the utilization of data address specific student needs although the application requires systems that link teachers and students as well as p and education data it does not explicitly call on districts to data systems for the implementation of early warning indicator recommendations all applicants should be required to

best practices support professional development promote school district report card data utilization of data and serves as a partner in supporting mechanisms as student trackers accelerated learning and supports as a result we believe it is critical that organizations have a strong role in the applications the development review and support of the application as described the guidance many schools and lack the capacity themselves to personalize instruction leading toward college and readiness and strong local education funds and national and intermediary organizations have the capacity to fill this b district capacity and success pen recommends that this section be changed community and district capacity and success the addition of community is consistent with one of the goals of rtt proposal linking school district and community including municipalities with student centered instruction capacity in a document just released and signed secretary duncan and six major national education organizations it recognized that no community can flourish unless its children safe healthy and and no school can a strong pillar of a thriving community without deep responsibility for and ownership of the academic thus recognizing that the fate of communities and their schools inextricably linked we must make schools stronger by embracing community resources expertise and activities and we make communities stronger by anchoring them around highly b under community and district capacity and success meaningful stakeholder engagement and pen joins with the coalition for community schools in applauding focus on engaging local for letters of support from key stakeholders to be these stakeholders must also have a voice in the planning this change would be consistent with the emphasis on deep community engagement and emphasis in school and consequently we propose adding to a the following in a description of how families teachers and principals participating schools as defined in this document and such stakeholders as parents and parent organizations students and organizations early learning programs the business community rights organizations advocacy groups local civic and organizations local government agencies institutions of education in addition pen would add local education and other local and national intermediary to strengthen the definition of key stakeholders throughout document we suggest adding a new definition to the guidelines based the existing key stakeholders includes parents and parent organizations and student organizations early learning programs the community civil rights organizations advocacy groups local civic organizations local government agencies education funds and other local and national organizations institutions of higher education c preparing students for college and careers teaching a and consistent with the definitions under community and district and success factors above we recommend that stakeholder support expanded in the communities they serve lefs working with partners have committed themselves to increase by the of high school students who graduate or are on track to college and career ready by the work of lefs along with other community stakeholders around the country demonstrates importance of broad partnerships partnership working in concert ensure that personalized learning is achieved and leads to college and career readiness under these two sections we note the role of community partners and lefs is noticeably absent from key actors responsible for learning in this section we changing and to include the with the support of parents teachers and other educational specialists and personnel and such key stakeholders d preparing students for college and careers teaching we suggest modifying the definition of school leadership team is used in c to more clearly define community members we adding community members and a representative of key we further suggest that the department add stakeholders as a definition in the guidelines and which should defined according to existing language in the guidelines stakeholders includes parents and parent organizations students student organizations early learning programs the business civil rights organizations advocacy groups local civic organizations local education funds and other and national intermediary organizations institutions of education add d to read all participating educators work with stakeholders as partners in exploring experiential models including education transformative experiences

exactly what they to succeed and funders and policymakers can better determine programs are working and which ones are not coordination will be important to the success of these often the community stakeholders are overlooked in recruitment induction retention and professional development addition works with the teachers already in the whereas community stakeholders can work with the district to create talent pipelines such as models stem inservice urban residency some of the more successful pipeline programs involved community partnerships with the school district and education for o pen believes that using the teacher urban residency model now supported and led by lefs in denver area new york philadelphia and los angeles chatanooga and seattle as well elsewhere in the nation provides the transformational model that turn around difficult and struggling schools and meet the of o another example is humanitas model employed by the los education partnership which focuses on transforming the school create more effective teaching and learning focusing on effectiveness and not on a minimum and arbitrary standards of qualified as in o yes another example is that of the public education fund chattanooga and the benwood initiative working with the most schools to provide the kind of personalized professional and support called for in the producing staggering increases reading and pen continues to be concerned about the distribution of less teachers who are significantly overrepresented in schools that minority and students in schools serving the most african american and hispanic students nearly twice as likely to be to employed to be teachers who are to the profession in the most recent us department of education report the study concludes that there is a growing disparity the least experienced teachers placed in schools with american and latino students it has been that even for highly effective teachers the first few years of career can be difficult research has shown that black and students have different levels of exposure to novice clotfelter ladd and vigdor and according to the center for educational statistics nces schools and staffing sass in most intervention models the teacher workforce was likely to be white younger and less experienced and more likely have provisional certification after intervention than before it addition the study found that the largest sector of current has only one year of experience a revolving door pattern instability and inexperience whereas in l the modality was years of c preparing students for college and careers pen joins the coalition for community schools in recommending surveys of educators f and students g should also include culture and the conditions for learning in order to paint a picture of the conditions in which teachers teach and students thus we suggest making the following changes to the definitions student student survey measures perspectives on teaching and related supports eg school climate school culture and conditions for learning in their classrooms and schools the must be valid and reliable over time these should be predictive of rates of student we suggest adding a parallel definition for educator survey mentioned but undefined that would educator survey measures perspectives on learning and related supports eg school climate school the conditions for learning faculty trust etc in their and schools the surveys must be valid and we strongly urge the department to add a parent survey that would districts learn more about parent engagement and their needs supporting student learning we suggest adding to parent survey measures perspectives on teaching and related supports eg school climate school culture and conditions for learning teacher and principal support for parent engagement in classrooms and schools the surveys must valid and lastly we strongly urge the department to add a community survey would help districts and the community learn more about community stakeholder involvement see stakeholders definition above ownership in advocating for change and building public will to the special needs of the most difficult schools we suggest adding to community survey measures and assesses individual and community capacity and perspectives on their understanding of academic and developmental student and school data the needs of most difficult schools the supports they are able to commit provide and their responsibility in supporting quality education for all children in their community the surveys must valid and competitive preference priority for middle and high a competitive preference priority should be given to applications focus their reform efforts on low performing middle and high serving large proportions of low income students the requirement at least forty percent of participating students must be families should be raised to at least fifty percent for eligible applicants and a competitive preference priority should be for applicants serving more than fifty percent in addition poverty the middle and secondary school level should be more measured by requiring the use of a feeder budget o recommendation pen recommends converting the optional supplement to competitive preference priority for supporting ttransition from high school to college and disconnected districts should be encouraged to focus attention on young people o among the least likely to enter postsecondary education o students who are credited and students who dropped out of high school or are otherwise disconnected from education in order to incentivize applicants to target our most students and support the transition to college and career the budget supplement should be converted to a competitive preference applications o implements strategies for supporting the successful between secondary and post secondary school through the expansion rigorous secondary curricula eg advanced placement international baccalaureate effective models such as dual and early college high schools school programs and targeted assistance in grade transition courses on grade grade assessments to reduce the need for remediation postsecondary education o develops partnerships between the school district the system employers nonprofit organizations and social providers to identify and connect students who have dropped out school are exiting the juvenile justice system or are and connect them to education job training wraparound support in order to increase the number of students who enter and persist postsecondary education we o focused efforts be made to ensure that high school particularly high school students are prepared for rigor of postsecondary education such efforts can o expanding school counseling o providing rigorous course options such as advanced international baccalaureate early college high school and enrollment o offering further practices that create a culture high pen recommends that the following data be collected on a basis to measure and report performance on college and o percent and number of ninth graders who graduate college and ready in four o percent increase and number of students to be college career o percent and number of students being taught effective o new assessments should be used to inform high school rather than high school exit requirements pursuing better opportunities rather than often counterproductive exit o metrics such as college preparatory course work in subjects such as algebra gpas and credit accumulation high graduation o college acceptance enrollment and persistence o student participation in college access such as counseling in addition pen recommends that when focusing on college and readiness that school districts with community partnership metrics indicators and a report card which tracks the student information and progress from the early years to college or career based on a project led and

particularly for children and children of color and our comments focus on how the guidelines can be used to help districts integrate and prioritize developmentally and culturally appropriate standards practices and include professional development opportunities focused on development cultural competence and family we applaud the focus on professional development for teachers selection criteria but believe that in order to fully educators of young children to improve instruction and increase effectiveness they must participate in professional teams communities and training that support their individual and capacity to build a deep knowledge of child development principles culturally relevant practices as well as to engage in supportive and ongoing relationships with provide additional opportunities for meaningful family while includes meaningful stakeholder engagement and support its reform conditions and includes engaging parents and families through the competitive priority we believe there additional opportunities to prioritize families as a critical of student achievement nbcdi recommends including parent surveys the performance measures particularly for young children who complete their own student surveys the parent surveys should perspectives on teaching learning school culture family efforts and existing home environments with respect to early we also believe the measure should go beyond the number and of parents completing the survey and should hold schools and accountable for acting on the results of the surveys themselves towards comprehensively and consistently engaging a diverse range modify definitions and metrics impacting children through third districts who choose to work with children in third grade and must be guided by developmentally

development opportunities that minimize the effects of student finally we know that many schools and districts are not building on the particular academic social and developmental and needs of children of color and that in order to achieve the outcomes for our children schools must feature culturally staff engaging in practice research shows that students of color are taught with culturally responsive their academic performance improves significantly we encourage department districts and schools to think about how to and honestly talk about understand and integrate culture into

design elements for elt schools in addition to time documentation of elt recent research has provided powerful quantitative evidence the need for substantially more time demonstrating the powerful of increasing school time by more than hours above the district schedule roland fryer studied the charter schools of new city and found that students in schools with at least percent time than the district significantly outperformed students in with less time in fact almost all the charters have more than regular district schools but what distinguished from the rest was having significantly more time than hours of additional time on average schools averaged annual hours hours more than traditional district schedule performers operated with average of hours hours more time than the same distinction was true for elementary schools where averaged annual hours hours more than the district the performers averaging only hours more hours the see will dobbie and roland g fryer jr beneath the veil of effective schools evidence from new york nber working paper no december httpaddr in addition to directly advancing the program requirements being consistent with the existing priority adding a elt competitive preference would be consistent with the other signature to advance school innovation and reform in addition to the improvement grant requirement of increased learning time the school turnaround and transformation models the recent flexibility waivers explicitly included expanded time in its school turnaround principles alternative interventions priority and focus schools and as an alternative to programs funded through the st century community learning the one distinction worth emphasizing to set apart from waivers or the required use of increased time in sig is that recommendation is limited to the context of providing points to gain priority within an already competitive grant program designed to the innovations in this context it makes sense to the highest possible bar providing clear and specific guidelines take advantage of known success factors to lift the plans to the to accomplish this goal nctl recommends the following section competitive preference expanded learning an applicant receives points under this priority based on the extent which it utilizes expanded learning time in a subset schools as a component of its plan to create environments that are designed to significantly improve teaching learning through in determining the extent to which an applicant meets this the department will consider the initial planning process to determine which would be included in the proposed expanded learning time including a demonstrated evidence of a strong rationale for determination which schools were b school leader and teacher

flexibility for learning time thank you again for this opportunity to provide comments to the department of education regarding the future of this important nctl would be pleased to respond to any questions the department have about our recommendation and looks forward to working with you help make the program a jennifer davis david president director of federal this approach would also be wholly consistent with the supplemental priorities for discretionary grant programs which a priority for projects that are designed to significantly efficiency in the use of time staff money or other resources order to improve results and increase productivity priorities for discretionary grant programs u s department education fr submitted by david on fri june vote vote june the honorable arne us secretary of maryland avenue washington dc dear secretary thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed rules for district race to the top rttt program the aft offers the comments based on our experiences implementing the state program as well as our experiences with the school improvement program and the elementary and secondary education act our and the students they teach every day are the people most affected by these policies and the aft was pleased to see that the department included the of school boards and superintendents the aft has long called shared responsibility or degree accountability for learning and the inclusion of that requirement in this rttt competition is an important first step in that we also appreciate that the department would require evidence of engagement in the development of an application and evidence feedback has been incorporated into the final this is in addition to requiring the signature of the union in the final application submission the aft is in complete with the department that collaboration is the key successful implementation of school reform and we know that no works over the long term without the support and of educators the school the aft questions whether districts have the capacity to implement all of the district rttt requirements in addition to all the other us department of education requirements just to eligible districts must commit to doing everything within the rttt program this includes full implementation of the common state standards and assessments developing and using data systems inform instruction fully implementing teacher evaluation systems supporting schools we are already seeing struggling just to implement common core to the degree necessary just to get teacher evaluation systems up and running neither of can be done without the full engagement of all staff this is on top many of these districts having to figure out their new systems and other requirements as part of the esea waiver packages is not clear how layering a personalized learning environment includes among other things a personalized learning plan defined as formal document for every student on top of all of these requirements will serve while this competition would require districts to do a lot it to require them to do some basic things that would have a impact on student learning nowhere in the document including detailed criteria for a personalized learning environment is there mention of barriers to student success and what the system would do address these barriers absent are requirements for districts provide the tools conditions and resources to enable teachers to their jobs the aft also is concerned that that this district rttt process favors charter schools especially online charters with focus on digital learning content this in despite of incontrovertible evidence that states which allow unfettered of charter schools and digital learning programs have ongoing problems with quality and irregularities taxpayers in california colorado and pennsylvania been fleeced by virtual school operators who profit by taking in full amount that traditional public receive rather than the amount of their actual instructional which are much lower digital schools also are a major affront tradition of local control of education with no for digital education providers to demonstrate community through a threshold number of petitioners or some other finally the aft reiterates our fundamental problem with the program the rttt brand serves to sort now winners and losers the real losers in this program are of course millions of children in districts that will not receive rttt and who will thus miss out on programs and following are aft comments on specific sections of the kristor director schools and the students who attend them should not be dependent the results of a competition for funds ostensibly designed to improve teaching and learning this is particularly true in times budget cuts and austerity measures in so many school systems the has always been troubled by the competitive nature of the department of race to the top grant programs rather picking winners and losers our education policies should represent comprehensive approach focused on preparing every student not just select few to succeed in college work and eligibility regarding eligibility criteria a the aft is pleased to see that the first time superintendent and school board members are evaluated the aft has long called for shared responsibility degree accountability for student learning including requirement into this rttt grant competition is an important first in that the aft will be watching the application process to see what propose with an eye to whether the department will hold as rigorous standard to proposals for the evaluation of teachers as it does for evaluation of superintendents and school it is not lost on us that while teacher evaluations must student growth measures including state standardized tests if they available evaluations for school board and superintendent must include an undefined student outcomes performance the difference treatment is striking the aft recommends that if teacher and evaluations must include student growth measures standardized tests if they are available then superintendent school board evaluations must be tied to the same regarding eligibility criteria and the requirement that districts must enable access and use by stakeholders given legitimate concerns about the quality of teacher evaluation systems reliability of using test score data the aft recommends applicants be required to guarantee teacher privacy with regard to release of teacher evaluation and test score data we also approve limiting the availability and use of these data as in reform to students educators and parents who can use the data inform and improve instruction and the aft firmly believes that collaboration is the to successful implementation of school reform and we know that reform works over the long term without the support and educators in the school system consequently regarding criteria a the aft supports the requirement that union leaders on to the rttt application regarding the aft recommends that also sign the application these partners are key to implementation of selection regarding student attendance research indicates that defined as missing or more days per year for to lower student achievement and a greater likelihood dropping out of school the aft recommends that instead of a nebulous goal of improving attendance districts focus their efforts improving the attendance of those of missing or more days per year by offering supports that have a track record of to keep such students in related to chronic absence is chronic tardiness which is often damaging to the tardy student as chronic absence but even disruptive to the education of other students because students who chronically tardy disrupt the teaching and learning environment everyone else in the classroom the aft recommends that districts be encouraged to focus on improving chronic regarding the aft questions why the department would teacher attendance in this group and strongly objects to this yet another mechanism to identify bad teachers first of all needs to be some critical look at the data behind teacher for example teachers are more often ill because they work in with lots of ill children teachers in schools probably more likely to be sick than teachers in because their students are less able to access their own also teachers are predominantly women and women miss work more than men so that they can care for their own sick family members the department is going to require an examination of attendance it should also require districts to examine the health their buildings are teachers missing schools because of mold principals treat teachers is morale so low that teachers need break and many other factors that may cause teacher reform regarding reform condition the intervention models are defined in the document if as we believe the intervention models the four school improvement models previously defined by the department of education the concerns articulated in our prior submitted to the department about the efficacy of these models unchanged further we believe that our concerns are even warranted as we witness continued implementation of these models schools across the country and no body of evidence justifying preferred overall we believe that the four options are too narrow rigid preclude the very reforms that have proven to be effective based our experience and evidence there are common characteristics that through not turnaround models we that the department consider offering districts a fifth model would allow a school to choose the appropriate components that meet needs of the students in that school schools choosing this model will need appropriate supports from providers to facilitate successful implementation of the the aft would consider community schools as a viable and fifth regarding reform condition the aft believes that student data to use by students educators and parents to inform improve instruction and services is an appropriate use of such regarding reform condition b if the aim of this requirement is improve teaching and learning and ensure equity we believe that us department of education is focusing too narrowly on salaries will provide an incomplete picture of the real problems schools to ensure that all schools and students what they need questions regarding building conditions discipline and safety policies transportation and availability and the level of professional respect and for growth each school offers should be asked and regarding reform condition b the aft appreciates that department is requiring districts to submit evidence that including teachers have been engaged in the development of proposal and how the proposal has been revised based on engagement and we recommend that community partners be added to the list of who should be engaged in the development of the specifically regarding the aft strongly recommends evidence of direct engagement and support for be replaced with certification signed by the recognized collective representative in support and specifically regarding the aft strongly recommends have voted to be inserted prior to support the preparing students for college and overall related to c preparing students for college and the aft supports the concept of a personalized learning with the caution that it will require a significant coordination resources and shift in how district staff works implementation of this personalized learning environment is going require significant time and effort it is not apparent from requirements that a of these components would be the aft highly recommends having such a and that the last beyond the first year of the also the creation of such personalized learning environments is to require significant professional development and significant time implement akin to the current transition to the common core we recommend that the provision of appropriate time professional development be worked into the components of personalized learning the aft recommends inserting community partners after teachers community partners are key to any successful improvement initiative in this specific case community partners offer engaging and relevant material that will enhance the learning regarding this seems to suggest that within personalized learning environment the district would have to every student with a personalized learning plan defined as a document that would include personalized learning recommendations on a current knowledge and skills aligned with college standards and available content instructional and supports the aft believes that there is an appropriate role such highly structured formalized and individually learning plans for students with disabilities and students dropping out for example but we also believe that the that such plans be created for every student in the district would overly burdensome and not result in increased student would reward applicants that ensure school leaders sufficient flexibility and autonomy over such factors as schedules and calendars school staffing models roles responsibilities for educators and and school budgets the aft objects to this for two reasons first this conflict with provisions of idea and ieps that are currently being for thousands of children across the country these ieps are definition very prescriptive in terms of student schedules and required to serve such students second calendars schedules staffing are subject to collective bargaining and we strongly to a program that would bypass the collective bargaining process pursuit of flexibility and regarding and g the way these performance measurements structured the department has set as the goal of these measurements simply to achieve targets in the number and percentage educators and students completing a survey the aft believes that department should be holding districts to the goal of reviewing data results and then planning for and implementing measures to outcomes for example by the definition student should measure perspectives on teaching learning and supports the goal should not be that a certain percentage of complete such surveys but that over time survey results increasing levels of satisfaction for such teaching and competitive preference the aft commends the department for including community partnerships a competitive preference priority given how essential partnerships are to the success of a school system we would have for them to be included in this grant competition as a requirement for all district applicants rather than as an could earn applicants extra points in the we strongly believe that community partnerships with schools can succeed if there is strong coordination between all parties to end we recommend that competitive preference priority be revised read the integration and coordination of education and recommend adding an additional bullet under competitive priority coordinate the resources and services that teaching and program the aft unequivocally supports program requirement district grantees to develop plans to ensure that minority and students are not overrepresented in discipline and expulsion cases an appropriate condition that should be the aft recommends adding a definition for stakeholder and that this definition be applied whenever the term stakeholder is in the document because school improvement cannot succeed without involvement of these crucial partners our recommended definition parents students teachers principals lea leaders residents and community partners such community partner may include groups such as public and private agencies organizations local government institutions of higher family support groups program providers museums other cultural institutions organizations organizations teachers

practices and innovations that have proven to truly work for student achievement this shift has begun to result in marked improvements across the nation with competitive grant process spurring districts and states implement the proven reforms and innovations that will drive towards improved academic outcomes for students for this potential continue to be fulfilled however the race to the top program must cross a critical juncture and begin to make accommodations for hundreds of urban school districts like bridgeport ct have long been the stories behind urban cities like bridgeport are all familiar the booming industrial and manufacturing centers of country throughout the s and s these cities quickly themselves in the s suffering from rapid deindustrialization economic decline in bridgeport a city which once hosted factories jobs quickly became scarce to compound the devastation of deindustrialization in these cities as factories and jobs were lost property values quickly plummeted in states connecticut where education funding comes primarily from local bases this all too often meant that funding and resources for rapidly dried up the end result for all of these cities has destructive the students living in poverty who need the most are provided with the fewest resources worse while urban centers have more recently benefited from both public and investment in school reform the medium sized cities like for the most part continue to remain it is the medium sized cities however where the greatest for dramatic impact on student achievement can be found the reason this potential lies in the very reason for which they are ignored their size unlike a typical larger city like new york its schools and million students it does not take an significant investment to produce major changes in place bridgeport instead smaller investments into cities rapidly transform entire school systems producing outcomes for students in a far shorter period of time furthermore limiting these investments to states like connecticut where waivers have been granted we can ensure that investments are implemented in state legislative environments which have flexibility necessary for effective the implications for these types of investments are clear with investments needed and quicker turnaround times required cities in the race to the top program can lead to transformation of not just four to five urban districts over the of a few years but hundreds it is in these hundreds in places harrisburg pa buffalo ny sacramento ca bridgeport ct and so more where the most significant impact on the achievement gap can made through race to the top and ultimately it is for that reason we urge the department of education to consider this submitted by paul vallas on fri

earliest years of life as getting ready for school begins at the incontrovertible evidence from research in early brain tells us that a earliest experiences play a dramatic role in ability to form a strong foundation for learning to grow healthy and to enjoy success in later life babies are born to the emergence of basic skills and competencies is directly linked the later development of more sophisticated complicated skills children who have experienced early life trauma or a vacant childhood seldom arrive at door ready to learn they with them their own unique set of challenges that do not easily with only traditional educational intervention begins much too late sustained exposure to risks poverty chaotic home environments malnutrition abuse toxins or poor quality child care can influence the architecture of the brain preventing infants and toddlers from developing the neural pathways and connections that facilitate learning scientists now know that toxic stress experienced in childhood can lead to problems with learning behavior physical and mental health because the capacity for decreases with age it is much easier to positively influence growing brain than to try to repair its circuitry in good quality early intervention programs can improve odds of positive outcomes we must translate what science tells the needs of infants and toddlers into effective evidence

june the honorable arne us department of maryland ave washington dc dear secretary thank you for the opportunity to submit comments on the us of proposal for a new district race to the top strive commends the us department of education for addressing important role that districts play in comprehensive education while it is critical to provide individual schools with the for dramatic change it is equally important to create regional to ensure sustainability of school improvement efforts at strive are dedicated to the creation of systems of collaborating with district leaders and community partners to scale successful teaching and learning strategies that improve success we are excited about many aspects of the proposal released by department in late may and hope to see the following policies remain the final regulations to be released this summer these o competitive preference priority for results resource alignment integrated services the key to sustainability of results widespread community engagement and alignment across the continuum we are excited to see the inclusion of competitive preference priority and hope this encourages more to seek expertise and resources beyond the bounds of the education system by engaging a wide range of local partners aligning their resources to support shared goals communities realize and sustain significant gains in student o productivity data driven decision making the emphasis productivity through greater transparency of resources continuous improvement and resource alignment is key to thinking at the district level district leaders have to learn how do more with less and new processes that emphasize improvement and data driven decision making will empower districts make important decisions about educational in addition to maintaining the policies above strive encourages department to consider the following improvements to the district race to the top o eligible entity clarify that districts can partner intermediary organizations to drive continuous improvement impactful practices and align and leverage local resources to practices that will help the district meet identified goals organizations can be critical partners in connecting siloed systems services and engaging public and private funders seeking to education communities across the country have begun to partner local intermediary organizations to identify what works and organize community resources the results are striking student outcomes and significant social return on o ongoing engagement of community stakeholders while we commend department for encouraging applicants to engage community in the application process we encourage the department to continued involvement of key stakeholders throughout the process this will help local education agencies leas expand capacity and achieve sustainability of their reform goals department can achieve this by adding the following language at the of and a description of the roles that each stakeholder play to help the lea achieve its o inclusion of indicators as districts track toward the goals outlined in their vision it is important districts to also track indicators success must defined by academic performance and improvements to culture and social and emotional of students we encourage department to add at least two indicators to the list areas leas must track under the section titled vision this will districts the flexibility to identify indicators relevant to student o encourage regional scale and sustainability as demonstrate how they will achieve district wide reform participating schools we believe it is important to districts to think beyond their traditional geographic boundaries department should change the language in to read as how the implementation plan will translate into meaningful reform support district wide change beyond participating schools and help lea reach its improvement goals eg the logic model theory of change of how this approach will improve student across all schools in the lea community and o additional metrics for performance measurement the measures should be included in the performance measurement section ensure a more robust picture of student number and percentage of participating students reading on number and percentage of participating students assessed ready number and percentage of participating students who enroll in complete some form of postsecondary education o drive quality continuous improvement to ensure grantees implement quality continuous improvement process we recommend strengthening proposed language in to read strategy for implementing rigorous continuous improvement process that provides timely regular feedback on progress toward project goals and opportunities ongoing corrections and improvements during and after the term of grant this must include how the applicant will monitor measure use data to improve and scale best practices and publicly share quality of its race to the top district funded investments such professional development technology and o elevate the importance of cradle to career partnerships and community collaboratives across the country have begun to move needle on education reform celebrating significant results that from cradle to career these collaboratives recognize the need dramatic change across the entire education continuum and committed to an ambitious vision that tracks success from readiness to college and career success the department encourage more communities to embrace this type of reform by applying sliding scale to the competitive preference priority with points awarded to districts seeking funds for a cradle to thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important proposal look forward to working with communities in the months ahead to effective ideas that will better inform policy and jeff managing strive about strive is catalyzing a national movement focused on the success every child from cradle to career building on the principles collective impact strive is helping communities create the infrastructure to unite stakeholders around shared goals measures results in education and organizing a national network of cradle career communities strive is a subsidiary of submitted by jeff on fri june vote vote dear mr on behalf of the illinois state board of education we thank you the opportunity to submit comments to the draft requirements criteria proposed under the race to the top district we are pleased to be a race to the top phase grantee the our race to the top application has created is invaluable to reform agenda we hope that the competition will preclude future state competitions furthermore as our comments detail we hope that the competition will work in close and coordination with our race to the top phase we were pleased to see the focus on personalized learning via priority as a state we are working to create the conditions for personalized learning to take place in our districts at least initiatives that are part of our race to the top application districts to deliver personalized learning the illinois learning environment which incorporates the gates and foundation funded shared learning infrastructure and enhancements and extensions will create a common data technology platform to support personalized learning including the of learning maps our approach to programs of study includes requirement for individualized learning plans aligned to p programs of study at the high school the role of the state should be the application requirements propose that states may provided an opportunity to comment on district applications a review of applications should be required further the time established for the state review of these applications should extended we suggest at least two weeks to permit states to substantive comments and to increase the likelihood of the comments contributing to the final content of the application the lea response to the comments is suggested as suggest that the response to comments be district participation and were crucial to previous race to top competitions similarly we strongly believe that sustainability and benefits of applications relies heavily state support and coordination we suggest that district that are endorsed by the state be given scoring priority applications that have a state endorsement will make it more that the plans can be implemented and furthermore we suggest that similar to the previous race to the competition requirement that of state funds go to leas a significant share of funds should be set aside implement state rtt initiatives at the district level for example order to ensure that the work of grantees is leveraged outside their boundaries grantees should be required to develop and a plan in coordination with the sea to share and disseminate lessons learned in the implementation of their application with districts in the as the final regulations are developed we strongly recommend that involvement be clarified so that it is explicitly made part of implementation period and not limited to the application period sustainability of district innovations developed will depend upon coordination and collaboration with the furthermore we also recommend that stakeholder engagement be to include the implementation period broad stakeholder engagement support beginning in the application period and extending to conclusion of the grant and beyond is key to a successful sustainable finally if no funds supplemental or otherwise will be made we seek to have the final regulations clarify that seas will not required to provide additional supports technical monitoring or evaluation for should align with previous race to the top district applications should align to existing requirements investments that are part of previous race to the top competitions example we are a race to the top phase state and our makes a substantial investment in our reform agenda applicants especially participating leas should be required to their applications to existing rtt state initiatives and reform agenda at minimum the alignment should make that existing state investments are not contradicted by the furthermore our race to the top application contains initiatives that directly address competition priorities requirements districts should be required to align their to existing state initiatives that already support priorities requirements districts should also be required to demonstrate how will leverage existing state resources and investments in these close attention to alignment will help to ensure support sustainability of their we wish to thank you again for the opportunity to provide about the

public sector information a september titled costs and benefits of data provision prepared by houghton for the australian national data service examines immediate and wider economic costs and benefits to making the key takeaway from the study the direct and measurable benefits making psi available free and unrestrictedly typically outweigh costs when one adds the benefits that we cannot measure cannot even foresee the case for open access appears to the report offers an interesting and instructive analysis about overarching potential of making psi available online free and under open licenses we assume the figures to australian find that the net cost to the australian bureau of abs of making publications and statistics freely available and adopting creative commons licensing was likely to have around million per annum at prices and levels activity but the immediate cost savings for users were likely have been around million per annum the wider impacts in terms additional use and uses bring substantial additional returns our estimates suggesting overall costs associated with free access to abs publications and data online and standard licensing of around million per annum and annualised benefits of perhaps million ie more than times the the houghton study suggests that open licensing is a key component reducing friction in the downstream use of it is not simply about access prices but also about the costs involved standardised and unrestrictive licensing such creative commons and data standards are crucial in enabling that is truly open ie free immediate and unrestricted efficient economic solution for the dissemination of psi is to be free libre and free gratis ie making it freely online and using unrestrictive licensing such as creative in a separate internal document noted in the report the bureau of statistics described the impact of adopting cc licensing says that cc licensing meets public expectations with regard to government facilitates data sharing including across allows for more timely reuse of statistics facilitates and makes sense to a growing percentage of people who recognise understand cc licence symbols and the study urges us to try to understand and foster the yet potentially powerful innovation that can be unleashed when psi made freely available online and released using unrestrictive in the longer term there may also be unforeseen uses and that simply cannot be accounted for and again this may mean the costs and benefits experienced in the early years implementation tend to understate the advantages and can also have wider impacts in terms of innovation the development and introduction of new products services processes that in turn generate new economic economic new business opportunities better informed and

investors measure to help them predict potential success of emerging market send to friend send this page to a quick o o o o lack of knowledge high perception of risk limit investments emerging o the o the process of open o the process contributions competition o terms and the vine virtual integrated networking experience project will in prizes to individuals or teams of contributors developing investment indicators for emerging market smes small we will do this through a online competition that invites anyone with ideas to collaborate and refine them the end result will be an index factors that the seven fund will release to the public to assist broader analysis of investment opportunities for emerging entrepreneurs in emerging markets frequently cite a lack of access investment capital as a barrier to starting and growing businesses in the us europe and other mature markets smes from an inflow of capital from venture capitalists private and banks however investments in emerging markets limited by a lack of information and therefore a high perception risk the seven fund is sponsoring a competition designed to diverse thinkers from around the globe to develop a set of indicators and processes that can be used to assess emerging smes potential the goal of the competition is to provide a new set metrics that can be used to help improve investor confidence stimulate investment in promising emerging market of knowledge high perceptions of risk limit investments in barriers to commercial financial investment in emerging particularly in ventures fascinate us at the seven most oecd countries have flourished from high levels of investment flowing into smes outside of a few major hotspots such china brazil and india there is almost a complete lack of activity in developing we seek to further explore causes and possible solutions of this limited financial different investment vehicles exist for companies at different of size and development in emerging market economies there exists vehicle for very small through the various and offerings and a vehicle for large established entities through the banking and global financial markets the that have the most difficult time accessing capital are the small to enterprises smes that need more funds microfinance can offer and do not qualify for investments from banks the world financial markets although each country identifies a differently the most definition held by the eu is a sme is a firm consisting of between to investment level is a function of risk perception the higher the perceived by most investors the lower the actual investment risk on the other hand is a function of knowledge and the more an investor knows about an investment opportunity the the perceived risk to the investor venture capital firms vcs in us and europe work within this spectrum in markets where they more information and knowledge than the average investor investors use evaluation methods such as financial ratios to help determine the risk of their investment in equities these ratios are of very little to no use when looking at smes with revenue history therefore vcs specialize and become experts certain industries or sectors their acquired pattern recognition the potential for success in a specific industry allows them recognize winning ideas and entrepreneurs this expertise in lowers the risk of investment for however rather than using the financial ratios of general investors evaluate companies many vcs develop their own indicators known as proxies or analogs that help them to measure the success potential of smes these indicators serve to reinforce decisions made based on their pattern recognition such might consist of the time it takes a company to hire top talent the values and attitudes of the management team or the at which a company produces its first prototype others include amount of capital put into the by the the growth potential of the market or the number of potential to exit the investment the possibilities are endless these allow the vcs to quantify and reinforce their pattern recognition looking at but crucial markers of success capitalists are able to take risks that the average investor is not spreading the risk over multiple investments in the hopes that just returns a substantial payoff vcs have developed sophisticated useful systems and tools for managing risk and predicting success can benefit other investors we believe there is much that can learned from vcs and many of their findings apply particularly emerging we define emerging market economies to broadly encompass countries with a growing entrepreneurial class investors are challenged to find a model that functions in environments for a wide range of smes for example one manufacturer of solar photovoltaic panels needed to raise to reach its ambitious growth plan and was able to access venture funds and management talent one the other side of spectrum an african horticulture company that processes and vegetables to europe needed to expand its operations but little access to funders outside of its home country the that we pose to you is to find a model that can address the needs both types of small and companies are important for growth prosperity for two reasons smes can spur greater innovation traditional legacy firms hampered by bureaucracy corruption and incentive to protect the status quo indirectly a strong base of also indicates cultural and economic vibrancy as this sector typically where employment growth is highest the best ideas and economies learn to compete the seven fund is putting out a challenge a question to be answered anyone and everyone recognizing that traditional financial ratios assessment metrics are not sufficient for identifying emerging market firms we therefore pose the following what indicators can outside investors measure to help them predict potential success of emerging market process of open in building our index we could have taken several approaches we engage top academics economists and business strategists working developing markets or we could ask investment bankers and capitalists already investing in these markets we could go straight entrepreneurs themselves we believe however that stimulating dialogue among all these groups and anyone else who is inspired participate will generate the most powerful insights we welcome contributions from participants in our process of open innovation is inspired by several including a story featured in bill and polly mavericks at that recalls how a canadian organized an engineers and from around the world to submit their best ideas for where to drill gold the contest caught the eye of an australian engineer by the of nick archibald who had developed technology exploration archibald believed that his technology also work for minerals such as gold so he entered and won contest earned a huge prize and became an instant potts of a second inspiration comes from eric paper the cathedral the bazaar which describes the differences of a structured organized versus a collaborative development model open in the software industry as advocated by linux inventor linus finally we believe in the idea that the group knows more than any individual and that innovation often comes about when an expert one field looks at and tries to solve problems in a different as discussed at length in the recent book wikinomics development is being used across industries to expand the pool of developed to solve complex problems by tapping into the collective intellectual capital proposed solutions are more than if informed by only one this competition is a challenge prize paying homage to the other challenge prizes we wish also to recognize the roots of process used so effectively in the open source software movement engineers computer programmers and scientists we are pleased to among the early experimenters using the same process to seek in other this competition is the ideal situation to think differently innovate to look at an old problem in a new way and that is inviting you to do we are opening up this competition contributors who want to engage and pave the way forward to exciting investment opportunities in emerging market entrepreneurs will take the winning ideas and test them in rigorous academic later for now were interested in your most wildly innovative the contest runs on the seven website httpaddr submissions are due by november and the round of collaborative development ends on december winner will be announced in january and receive the will be awarded to all those who contribute to the winning starting with the originator and continuing to nodes along the process contributions competition phase i initial submission july november the first step to participating in the competition is to submit idea participants may submit their ideas using the form httpaddr submitted ideas can any form individual indicators a complete framework for evaluation equation that can be used to input indicative information anything can come up with see sample submissions we welcome your innovative registrants may submit more than one idea a word on the style in submissions should be made this is not an academic submissions will be judged on clarity and conciseness submissions are limited to a maximum of words and should include word abstract submissions that are brief address just one of the discussion or not comprehensive are also encouraged provide brief citations for any sources you phase ii collaboration november december after november all submitted ideas will be posted to a and everyone who has submitted an idea will receive a username password during this period of collaboration new and contributors post new comment on an existing combine refine and change although new contributors are encouraged during this phase the bulk the financial reward will be dedicated for participants that original ideas in phase i however we hope that the teams that formed during this phase will develop richer more comprehensive for evaluation final submissions of these combined refined ideas be submitted by december phase iii voting and awards january after december we will close the wiki to further edits and off registration in prizes will be awarded the community will be asked to select the top five finalists from an expert panel of judges will make the final selection of asked where does the name vine come from vines are growths based on flexible stems they possess nodal points of are often opportunistic and light seeking they are an adaptation life in areas where small patches of fertile soil are adjacent exposed areas with more sunlight but little or no soil many rock exposures and other supports rather than investing energy their own supportive tissue to enable them to climb toward the and flower seven aims to be a kind of rocky support to emerging how will the funds be awarded the will be awarded participants at critical nodes along the vine of the evolution of winning idea for example the originator of the winning proposal receive with each for two key contributors and each for the other four what does a successful submission look like submitted ideas can any form individual indicators a complete framework for an equation that can be used to input indicative information you can come up with below are two samples that provide examples the wide diversity of styles that we encourage for sample submission a word count evalution high integrity of entrepreneur market growing at greater than fifteen percent annually entrepreneur familiar with target market little threat of competition in first three years highly likely that venture can be acquired or go public proprietary or product entrepreneur attention to detail in materials and presentation entrepreneur demonstrated leadership ability in past entrepreneur philosophy compatible with vc culture expected return of over within five years sample submission b word count vcs must refine their underlying model in order to take advantage emerging market talent of businesses the emerging model should add three elements that differ from traditional models screening diverse sector expertise and a typical vc is able to complete six to eight deals per year due the lengthy process of search screening and due diligence since average investment size can be times smaller in emerging vc managers find themselves unable to leverage their time to comparable returns to developed markets vcs should seek to university graduates in target markets to act as their job is to actively cast as wide of a net as possible and travel and meet entrepreneurs in person with salaries ranging as as per year vcs can thus access a wider investment without wasting managers time in addition vcs should utilize online business acumen test to further vet possible entrepreneurs will create a more robust of investment opportunities traditional models the vast majority of vcs are focused in the and sectors while the majority of emerging market smes are focused agriculture manufacturing and services vcs should therefore expertise in these areas again using local talent many these investments will require risk management such as climate risk or commodity price hedging that competing vcs do have this will allow vcs to access investments in emerging with little competition from other finally many emerging market smes struggle to offer a likely ipo acquisition exit option this has proven a major barrier to investment one solution is for vcs to offer a patient capital that expands the return on investment horizon beyond the five and seven years instead of a quick model vcs target sustainable ownership as long as the investment profitable the vc can recoup its investment through dividends smaller ownership sales this will require more patient that have a similar horizon fortunately there are growing number of investors with this profile including development banks private worth individuals and investment funds by specifying up front that an emerging market has a different investment

surveys through which consumers assess the quality of care they receive through their health from providers and in hospitals nursing homes facilities and other settings the cahps team has also research and developed guidance for reporting these data to providers and other audiences detailed information about products and history can be found at httpaddr in over americans were enrolled in health plans visited health facilities through which cahps data were b research this foa solicits research to be performed within five broad areas developing and testing cahps survey products b maintaining cahps surveys and all materials related to survey administration developing and maintaining materials related to reporting cahps results d designing and implementing quality improvement based on cahps data and e promoting cahps products each of areas is described in detail in this this foa lists approaches to aims as examples of the kind of work could be performed in support of a particular effort should not feel constrained by these suggestions or regard them inclusive of all the aims that may need to be performed in a area and are encouraged to propose different and new a note on terminology used in this foa the cahps team includes two cahps grantees ahrq cahps staff and staff from the network contract the cahps consortium or the includes all these groups plus any funder apart from ahrq of a product the steering committee refers to selected of each group composing the cahps consortium grantee teams are organized to develop a particular survey reporting resource improvement guide or other product grantee teams include members both grantee organizations as well as a support person from user network contract and an ahrq the successful adoption and implementation of cahps products are on collaboration among potential users stakeholders professional organizations health advocacy groups and many people and organizations also development and promotion of useful cahps products depends on cooperation trust and open sharing information within the cahps team in describing their ability perform the research in response to this foa applicants highlight their ability to work as part of collaborative teams addition to their technical skills and at the beginning of each project year the steering committee will in person to assess progress towards goals and activities for coming year the steering committee will also determine what types support will be needed from the user network contract in the coming to months after this meeting the director of the user contract will prepare a budget based on the list of the support activities the steering committee will then meet by phone discuss and refine the number and types of support activities as as timelines specific aims and for the purpose of application preparation applicants should that the maximum annual total costs of is to be approximately as developing and testing cahps survey maintaining existing cahps surveys and all materials related survey reporting cahps performance of quality improvement studies based on cahps disseminating and promoting cahps sources that may be helpful in developing content for this foa the national health care quality httpaddr and its updates and the affordable care act especially part d title subpart ii relating to consumer assessment of health care applications that respond only to individual objectives of this rather than the entire range of objectives will not undergo developing and testing survey products of the cahps iv grantees will need to work with the ahrq project pos to develop omb clearance packages to cover the collection data for survey testing and other purposes and develop packages submit to the national quality forum for a developing new from the beginning of cahps to the present the cahps team has had ideas and requests for new surveys than the budget could support their applications applicants should identify the most important within which new surveys should be developed and explain why development in these areas is critical applicants should describe the principles that guide their survey development process testing b developing materials to support the implementation of cahps every cahps survey comes with complete instructions for implementation from how to draw a sample or hire a contractor responding to questions from the news media about survey data the user network contractor takes the lead in assembling and publishing these implementation materials documents are based on written or verbal input from the grantees some user products such as programs for analysis of data must be developed by the grantees applicants must their capability for developing or collaborating in the development these products with specific emphasis on their experience them as part of a collaborative c advancing the science and practice of consumer developing new strategies for collecting cahps data since beginning of cahps the cahps team has developed both telephone versions of each survey in addition to formats applicants should consider identifying and testing methods for survey data collection such as data or interactive voice response if they yield valid and reliable these methods have the potential to reduce the cost of data thus making them more attractive to potential users as new for cahps surveys are explored the cahps team will need to reliable methods for obtaining data from and reporting data to with cognitive impairments and people with visual or impairments specific aims involved in this work may developing testing strategies conducting field tests analyzing and modifying methods applicants must describe their strategies obtaining information about and developing new techniques as well as testing these techniques and preparing them adoption by cahps d advising the user network managers on decisions to the cahps the user network contract develops and maintains two cahps one containing data from the cahps survey for health plans and a containing data from the cahps survey for clinician and practices grantee team members usually the principal attend an annual meeting with the managers of these databases to them on technical questions or questions related to the use of data sometimes these meetings are by conference call sometimes are usually in connection with a user applicants to this foa must account for their participation in annual meetings as part of their maintenance of existing cahps surveys and administration of to accommodate the needs of cahps survey users and organizations the cahps team strives to keep cahps core survey stable from year to year health care quality measurement is a field and from time to time the consortium considers and changes to the surveys administration strategies modes of collection as well as development and testing of new sets supplemental items applicants must describe how they plan to existing surveys and the types of testing that may be required support changes to the surveys they should also describe plans updating and maintaining all materials related to administration cahps surveys including but not limited to programs for analysis sampling strategies sample letters and postcards to respondent participation instructions for administering the via mail telephone or other media and instructions for surveys to as well as reporting cahps data of a development of reporting in cahps i the cahps team developed a template for users cahps surveys so they could report results to consumers and audiences but the cahps team found that no survey sponsor used template in its entirety though many used chunks of the text or data displays in reports they designed themselves in view of the cahps team realized that we could best serve report developers publishing reporting resources rather than templates cahps ii team developed two products for this purpose talkingquality web site and the report card compendium which briefly described talkingqualitygov to assist developers of quality reports consumers the cahps ii team developed a web httpaddr which organizes existing and research about principles of effective reporting talkingquality web site describes the entire process of developing quality report from getting started to evaluating the project offers when available advice on strategies contribute to a successful report card compendium in addition to advice about reporting sponsors often want to see how other organizations to theirs respond to the demand from consumers for understandable health quality information in response the cahps developed the report card compendium a directory of over of comparative information on the quality of health plans providers its purposes are to inform and support the people organizations that develop report cards and to provide easy access examples of different approaches to content and in cahps iii the cahps grantee teams worked collaboratively with user network contractor to completely update both resources cahps iv applicants may wish to consider updating them part of their applicants are free to propose development of additional resources if additional resources are proposed the applicant explain why this resource is necessary and how it will be useful report b composite labels development and cahps survey data are traditionally reported in composites roll up scores related to a cluster of items makes it possible for the user to review five or six composite rather than responses to or individual items most developers however choose to include individual item scores with composites for those users who want a more complete picture of quality of services offered by a provider or institution requires organizations that wish to use the cahps trademark on surveys to develop and report survey composites exactly as specified the administration instructions for that the labels for these composites must make sense and appeal to users cahps reports to ensure that this is the case the cahps team traditionally begun the process of composite label development conducting a factor analysis to see which items cluster together analysis team then meets with the reports team to develop draft for these item clusters the reports team then iteratively proposed labels with target audience members until they identify that work applicants must describe their ability to perform research or describe a different and better way to produce accurate understandable composite c conduct of research related to the science of in addition to the aims listed above past cahps grantees developed and performed research projects to advance the science reporting healthcare quality information to consumers and audiences for example the cahps iii grantees performed a study members of the target audience visited a web site that gives different types of information about physicians including data patient assessment data and anecdotal data participants in study were asked to review the data and select a physician who would best for them and their families the design of this experiment enable us to see which type of information users consult first or often as well as their reasons for choosing these sources ahrq is interested in research that examines the effect of ways to report health quality data to consumers for choice of care services and providers and their organizations for improvement applicants to this foa must describe research studies they wish to conduct in cahps iv applicants choose to devote funds to a single large report research study as cahps iii grantees did in either case the study description explain why testing the proposed hypothesis is important and how results will benefit the report development d additional reporting in addition to the aims applicants must describe experience with and demonstrate their ability develop cahps products for culturally diverse audiences and with poor reading or cognitive develop and test spanish language work with the user network contractor to promote cahps contribute information to assist in the aims of updating revising reporting resources and materials relate to elements in cahps implementation work with the user network contractor to identify and existing research published and unpublished regarding of health quality quality improvement of cahps began with a primary goal of providing to consumers and purchasers which they could use to guide their plan selection decisions as cahps has evolved there has been interest in exploring the usefulness of cahps data for strategies to improve the quality of health care from the consumer patient a quality improvement qi studies based on cahps for the purpose of application preparation each applicant assume that they will conduct one quality improvement study within first half of the project and one additional study in the last half the project both studies should be based on cahps data for first study the applicant should recruit a site at which the will be conducted and include letters from the organization its willingness to collaborate should the application be description of these study designs must show that the has the skills and expertise necessary for designing implementing and evaluating quality improvement studies based on data for the qi study proposed for the latter half of the applicants are not required to have already recruited a should describe these studies in their applications in a way that allow reviewers to assess that ability to perform work before beginning work with a second site the grantee submit a research plan and obtain approval for this plan from project applicants may choose any cahps survey to use as pre and post of change applicants are free to propose any qi study they like ahrq is interested in studies that incorporate multiple in different settings another area of interest for potential collaborations is projects these projects incentives to health plans provider groups and other health delivery systems to improve their performance by offering financial reimbursement or special bonuses to those who meet goals cahps or similar consumer assessment data are often included one of the performance measures in these types of studies should consider proposing one or more qi studies that interventions and measurement strategies that will relatively easily and at low cost to other applicants may need to develop different and new cahps products implement a qi study for example cahps data can identify areas a provider or an organization is performing poorly eg in communication skills but these data do not specify where and what particular communication problems are thus grantees may need develop qualitative or quantitative tools to pinpoint behaviors that need to be changed like all cahps products interview protocols focus group discussion guides and other materials developed for qi studies will be published on the web and available to users free of b the cahps improvement the cahps team in collaboration with the center for medicare medicaid services cms developed the cahps improvement practical strategies for improving the patient care experience in ii this document which was updated during cahps iii is available the cahps web site and contains a wealth of information about the of patient experience data assessment of an to change and steps to implementing quality improvement it also identifies strategies that can be used for improvement applicants to this foa may consider updating resource as part of cahps iv as well as developing additional to assist cahps survey users in implementing quality disseminating and promoting adoption of cahps products providing technical assistance of the though dissemination and promotion is described in this category many of the aims relating to these areas are intertwined the development work some additional aims are described a user network since the beginning of cahps national user network meetings have an important and positively evaluated means of communicating with product users these meetings allow users to discuss problems issues with survey implementation report preparation procedures or any other issue related to cahps products it allows users to meet each other and share strategies to obstacles or success stories related to use of cahps products network meetings have also allowed the cahps consortium to hear problems that need to be fixed information that needs to be or explained differently or requests for new since the contract that supports cahps and promotes its also performs these services for surveys of patient culture sops for hospitals medical offices and nursing homes it anticipated that a sops survey for pharmacy will be completed by time these cooperative agreements are awarded the past two network meetings have included sessions on cahps sessions on sops sessions that address the use of data from each of these identifying areas where providers and health care organizations improve service though developing sops surveys is not part of foa grantees need to be familiar with sops surveys and contribute planning sessions at user group meetings httpaddr for more about sops organizations who receive cahps iv awards must collaborate with other and the user network contractor to plan and present one meeting during the five year span of this agreement this collaboration will involve but is not limited identifying a location appropriate for the meeting planning the of the meeting content for the sessions and proposing serving as speakers moderators or facilitators at the developing a strategy for soliciting and reviewing proposed for the meeting working with the user network contractor on all elements of meeting planning presentation and in addition to user network meetings applicants may wish to planning and delivery of smaller scale meetings on narrower such as best practices for reporting cahps data to purchasers of health care services or b participation in the ahrq annual every september ahrq sponsors a meeting to showcase research and present information and discussion on issues related mission in the past the cahps team has found that this offers a relatively way to communicate new information cahps for budget preparation applicants should assume that the cahps will present three cahps sessions and one cahps at the annual meeting for four years of the five year span of this the team will not present cahps sessions at the ahrq annual during the year in which the user meeting will take c additional applicants are free to propose additional meetings for the purpose disseminating information about cahps products for example the ii grantees developed and presented a meeting to present and cahps research conducted both within and outside of the dwebinars podcasts use of social media and to cahps applicants to this foa must collaborate with the network contractor on the development and delivery of webinars podcasts related to cahps surveys data reporting and improvement strategies topics for these webinars and podcasts will determined in collaboration with ahrq staff and the user contractor applicants to this foa may wish to suggest strategies in addition to webcasts and podcasts for reaching users with new information about cahps products and e other dissemination and promotion applicants to this foa will also assist the user network when necessary with responding to requests for information from present information about cahps products at professional publish articles including monographs and special journal if appropriate about cahps in professional journals meet with who play a critical role in the adoption of cahps products such ncqa nqf or the hospital quality alliance and perform activities if see section viii other information required federal for policies related to this section ii award mechanism of this funding opportunity will use the cooperative agreement mechanism in the cooperative

administrative requirements cooperative terms and conditions of funds although the financial plans of ahrq provide support for this awards pursuant to this funding opportunity are contingent upon availability of funds and the submission of a sufficient number meritorious ahrq intends to commit approximately million dollars in fy fund two applications each application must be five years in with a budget not to exceed million annually in total costs to government facilities and administrative costs requested applicants are included in the total cost limitation applications project periods that exceed five years or budgets that exceed million total costs in any given year will not be reviewed beyond the first year will be contingent upon a review by agency of the continuation section iii eligibility since ahrq has funded cahps grantees to develop and test experience surveys to conduct research on reporting survey results consumers and other audiences and to develop and implement improvement programs based on cahps asking health care organizations to change practices such the use of a new survey for collecting patient assessments of care often met with resistance most organizations that collect these have invested a considerable amount of time and money in development systems to sample patients collect the data analyze the data interpret the results to these changing surveys and associated systems even when a new survey has advantages over the existing one often looks like spending resources to fix something that over the past years ahrq has learned that the most important leading to adoption of cahps surveys is a strong and consistent relationship between the cahps team and potential users this involving potential users as well as organizations that them in all phases of product development from identifying topics and items to brainstorming about potential obstacles to adoption in cahps iii the cahps team spent three years an excellent working partnership with stakeholder organizations develop the cahps survey for the medical home though a first draft of this survey has been produced there is work to be done in this area such as a field test to implementation issues including the effect of survey methods on validity reliability and other variables and testing strategies for lower cost data collection it would take months new grantees to develop a similar working relationship with all stakeholders in this process and it would extremely difficult accurately communicate the history of decisions that lead to product for these reasons ahrq has decided to limit the for cahps iv to the two existing eligible number of applications each applicant may only submit a resubmissions applicants are not permitted to submit a application in response to this a eligible the competition for this foa is limited to the two current cahps hhs grants policy requires that the grant recipient perform substantive role in the conduct of the planned

thru a forum response prizemaster to a question posed in a post but was not included in data directory that people downloaded nor its existence broadcast all the contestants by those who knew about this data set and used it in their solution had unfair advantage over those who know the difference winning an losing could have been just that given the photo that we it is unfortunate that the fairness of such a major competition compromised by something that registered posts grand prize awarded to team pragmatic for those interested in some additional numbers including the rmse a blend of bpc and the ensemble we posted them on our httpaddr the blend quoted there is not the theoretical best value which require drilling down to the constituent prediction sets that make the two final

httpaddr the netflix prize was brilliant google and microsoft should the httpaddr as to the quote that this contest proves that most fail by sorry i dont have his name handy maybe just throwaway comment but i must respectfully strongly every aspect of the competition arguably contributed to the and collaboration in particular collaboration demonstrably had effect of pushing the bar ever the contest can be seen as an evolution in collaboration the results were mainly by individuals think simon funk the team began to coalesce and combine and in the end entire teams and recombined anyone who thinks collaboration was not at the heart of this competition is just very mistaken id say publishing results is also a method of collaboration among teams and we see collaboration by netflix to participate with conferences the key words for this is symbiosis and feedback the feedback loops the better the scoreboard is a feedback publishing results is a feedback loop the online forum is a loop the two conferences are feedback loops teams combining is feedback loop media coverage is yet another feedback loop collaboration is tightly coupled with all what is true is that most contestants fail to win first place that was known prior to the competition its an intrinsic property all competitions in general not of the netflix prize in also winning st place is of course not the only good reason i will take an analogy from biology that some might laugh or cringe but which i would argue is highly meaningful and analogous there only one egg and millions of sperm only a single sperm fertilizes egg and its superiority over the nd best sperm is surely so close nothing as to be therefore a contest among humans is similar to the fertilization of egg a mechanism that has been tested and reused by evolution uncountable species over maybe hundreds of millions of and of course the internet is a massive naturally for this to play last edited by vzn registered posts grand prize

this competition and it is poetic justice that guys came out on there is absolutely no blame or diminished value for your teams of the kdd data the blame lies squarely on netflix who undoubtedly made a naive mistake in an otherwise highly as you can see from the web page it would have taken than a basis point of performance to give them the additional win according to the digit rounding rule i have no idea if they used the kdd labeled points or not nor if that would have made difference or not but any way you look at it netflix made sophomoric mistake by allowing the kdd data to be used informing all the contestants about it via last edited by statistician registered posts grand prize awarded to team pragmatic netflix wasted the million dollars i have been a member for years and i

http://www.inspirenetwork.org/mnre/doc/Final_Report_Cookstove.doc initiative for development and deployment of improved cookstoves recommended action report by institute of technology energy and resources institute new of new and renewable of large percentage of population continues to depend on biomass for their cooking needs the cooking devices used by majority of them have very poor thermal efficiency and serious health impacts due to unclean combustion while past few decades have seen a lot of interest the world over in development of better cookstoves for burning biomass the magnitude of the problem is still a major cause of concern in india a lot of resources went into the national programme on improved cookstoves between and with mixed experiences learning from this programme a need has been felt to start a new initiative on biomass cookstoves with a different approach considering the changes that have taken place in the society technology and the global concerns initiate the process of formulating a new programme a brainstorming session was held by the government in march involving various experts from within india and abroad subsequently in october ministry of new and renewable energy mnre awarded a joint project to iit delhi and teri for six months to make suggestions for the broad contours and the action plan for such a programme in consultation with the stoves community across the country and abroad covering various aspects relevant to biomass cookstoves team of five investigators undertook the task of carrying out wide consultations to formulate the recommendations presented in this report the recommendations have been prepared for five different aspects of cookstoves which the new initiative should address these are i an innovation contest for next generation of cookstoves ii technical aspects including and various issues related to testing and standards iii delivery of improved cookstoves iv fuel processing and supply v community stoves moreover to address the need for a different structure of the new programme npic the project team has also made recommendations for management and implementation strategies for the new initiative recommendations for each of the components outline the activities that need to be carried out under the new initiative it is suggested that these activities be carried out in two phases phase i comprising of the tasks which need to be started immediately so as to prepare the ground for the long term activities to be undertaken in phase ii a brief summary of these recommendations is presented suggest an approach to develop the appropriate technology we also recommend that this prize be central focus on cleaner and efficient combustion is required in order to achieve the health and social gains that are the primary motivator for this the basic technical performance specifications for the cookstove prize should be based on four key parameters carbon monoxide co particulate matter pm efficiency and black carbon additionally have to consider cost safety and as additional given the complexities of the prize design process partnering with the right organization to develop the prize is absolutely critical this organization must have both expertise in developing such prizes and has a global to be carried out in this phase initiating the process of prize design with a the of the entries at the end of the contest cookstoves initiative would need to address the technical needs of the programme which can be categorized under two broad categories a research and development covering fundamental as well as applied research and development of new products b testing and standards addressing the issues related to testing protocols setting up of testing facilities and development of standards for certification specifically the recommendations are summarized as follows i was recognized that there is a need to carry out modifications in the existing bis protocol to take into account the requirements of the new designs in the market it is suggested that interim modifications be made in the protocol on a priority basis after due consultations among the stoves community and also taking into consideration the international developments in stove testing protocols this may be carried out as a short term project coordinated by one institute but with a mandate to involve all the relevant organizations in the process of consultation during the process testing facilities can be set up at one of the institutes for experimental trials of the proposed protocol is also suggested that a more rigorous research oriented approach be adopted to develop protocols which are more suited to the new designs and give greater importance to emissions measurements it is suggested that this work be taken up as a coordinated project by a group of institutes with technical expertise as well as field experience in testing the process for award of such a project should be initiated immediately after the interim protocols are in place is also a strong need for developing standards to enable certification it is recommended to have for various stoves considering the thermal efficiency as well as emissions the performance standards corresponding to the star ratings need to be identified as part of the coordinated project for developing protocols as in recommendation these standards should be linked to health impacts of the cookstove types of testing centres are recommended to be set up as part of the new initiative i in laboratories for cookstoves which can serve as training centres ii certification facilities run by independent organizations iii field testing facilities with grassroot level ngos in the first phase expression of interest eois can be invited for setting up these centres by the time interim protocols are in place the process of setting up a few centres can be set in order to do research on the fundamental scientific principles underlying the design and operation of cookstoves it is recommended that coordinated projects involving research groups across the country should be funded some of these groups could graduate into centres for stoves on the basis of their commitment in the first phase eois followed by open requests for proposals rfps can be invited to form consortia to work on different fundamental aspects as identified in the report it is proposed that all the project proposals be evaluated in a coordinated manner by an advisory body and not viewed as independent proposals as in the routine process of funding by the funding agencies the time this phase starts it is expected that new protocols would have been identified and hence the testing centres initiated in the first phase can get into full operation centres with testing facilities can start regular training of personnel from the commercial testing centres as well as field testing centres the certification centres can carry out the testing in accordance with standards with the services of the field testing centres would be required for evaluating the performance of the improved stoves in the field after a pilot programme first and later as part of any full scale dissemination the formation of consortia the research activities can be funded and would continue into phase ii while giving valuable inputs in the development of new stove designs by the technical is also recognized that there are many stove manufacturers who can develop potentially good stove designs intuitively but they would need technical support to improve upon their designs in order to help stove developers in conducting fundamental analysis of the new designs technical consultancy centres possibly linked to any of the centres could be facilitated to operate in commercial consultancy mode this aspect is particularly important to address some of the specific regional cooking needs of are the recommendations for strategies to be adopted for delivery of stoves for programme as a for an improved cookstove initiative to be sustainable commercialization must be encouraged market development is in turn integral to promoting commercialization a widespread awareness campaign that leverages all forms of media on a massive scale various government channels such as schools and health and social services institutions village demonstrations and advertising among village families and is branded with a recognizable logo and celebrity endorsements would be the best strategy to develop the improved cookstove market a technology is adopted for wide dissemination its assessment and certification must be carried out the certification which is expected to be based on rigorous lab level tests could be the basis of technology selection for pilot level programmes the technology selection for wider dissemination should be based on evaluation of the pilot level programmes the performance of the technology selected must be above a minimum threshold as decided at the appropriate ensure effectiveness in the initial stages of the program it should be carried out in the regions first these targeted areas should be selected based on a variety of strengths including the presence of financial institutions biomass availability managerial and technical readiness determined by past and ongoing successful cookstove dissemination projects and delivery channels maharashtra tamil nadu and karnataka meet these order to reach as many households as effectively and efficiently as possible an extensive network of various types of dealers must be utilized this network could include entrepreneurs and shop owners rather than solely create new delivery networks it may be more efficient to take advantage of existing value chains as well these value chains could be leveraged through collaboration with existing programs such as project shakti and others agricultural retail chains such as hariyali kisaan bazaar and tata kisan sansar and petty the perspective financing an improved cookstove is the greatest challenge there are two options for user subsidies no direct subsidy or a continually decreasing subsidy for the equivalent expenditure on the current annual lpg subsidy cookstoves can be disseminated to every household in rural india under various subsidy schemes households that cannot afford to purchase a stove even after subsidies should be able to receive loans mnre should establish linkages with institutions that can provide these loans such as nationalized banks commercial banks and microfinance institutions additionally as loans often have steep interest rates and many borrowers may not be able to afford the interest interest payments could be partially or fully financial assistance should be linked with the performance of the technology as well as the affordability level of the order to encourage production mnre could offer a advance subsidy or a production tax credit to receive an advance subsidy payment a manufacturer must increase production of cookstoves by a certain percentage under a production tax credit scheme for every certain number of stoves produced a manufacturing company could receive a certain amount of tax credit or choose to take a grant of up to a certain percentage of the manufacturing property value revolving fund could finance other dissemination activities such as awareness raising education of users training of retailers etc the initial seeding for the revolving fund could be provided by nationalized and commercial banks or mnre and various stakeholders which should be members of the partnership could take out loans for dissemination clean development mechanism cdm and carbon credits should be considered for funding the initiative the potential fuelwood and carbon emission savings should qualify cookstove initiative for cdm funding the money earned from selling carbon emissions reduction certificates could be used to fund any combination of the aforementioned activities or financial incentives furthermore carbon credits would encourage private sector participation if manufacturers have the rights to the carbon credits they could use these credits to minimize the retail cost of their stoves is recommended that the dissemination of cookstoves should be carried out first at the pilot level different regions should be selected for pilot programmes experimenting with different delivery models as suggested above based on the outcome of the pilots the strategies for the full scale dissemination can be identified specifically the following activities need to be carried out in the pilot phase or phase of regions suitable for pilot study and conducting baseline surveys for energy consumption with traditional of stove designs for pilot dissemination in selected dissemination strategies for different regions viz direct or indirect subsidies modes of creating user awareness and linkages with banks and mfis establish revolving agency for out awareness campaigns and village of stoves through collaborative supply and evaluation of the pilot strategies for large scale on regular processing and supply are the recommendations for the new initiative to take care of the crucial aspect of fuel cookstoves programme must have a dual thrust on technological improvement in stoves as well as establishment of an assured fuel supply chain the latter is critical to dissemination of devices with rural household has an immense variety of biomass residues transforming them into processed fuels for use with improved cookstoves is crucial to extracting the best performance combustion efficiency and reduced emissions from this initiative pelletizing will be more suitable than briquetting whose size and cost constrains its use in household extensive study on the availability of biomass residues surveying type quantity seasonal variations costs and suitability for pelletization is required as existing data is quite is required for the development of biomass pelletizing machines for production of fuel pellets from available suitable for decentralized operation with a capacity of and with low electricity requirement besides standards need to be evolved for such machinery the research and development of an efficient and improved closed loop decentralized charcoal making unit operating on agricultural residues is field deployment and testing of these fuel processing units in varied regions will allow a detailed assessment of their performance involving the local community in the various operational aspects of the biomass processing unit will integrate and embed this initiative deep into the context of the field energy environment also offering immense possibilities for fostering participation and activities to be carried out in the two phases are enumerated survey of biomass availability present level utilization cost etc for selected regions in the appropriate pelletizing technology available in the country which could be disseminated directly or could be quickly upgraded field testing of the technology and its upgradation with the help of technical expertise if required dissemination of these machines along with the pilot dissemination of stoves as suggested above to use different local design and development of new pelletizing machines and charcoal development and setting up commercially viable fuel processing units and supply operation monitoring and upgradation as per of the the activities and programs emerging from the national biomass cookstoves initiative in the partnership ppp model at all levels will ensure that participants government organizations industry academic and social sector entities can leverage each expertise and ppp needs to be established by an initiating agency comprised of a network of stakeholders and led by a governing council administrative support group would be required to conduct administrative tasks to ensure smooth operation of the partnership and an advisory board would provide guidance to the governing council ceo and project management unit pmu would facilitate project implementation with different areas of expertise would give input to the administrative support group advisory board and project management is suggested that the regional linkages for project implementation be worked out by the project management unit proposed is required from various government ministries industry sources for the awards competition technical testing protocols and facilities and dissemination training electronic print and contact publicity and programmes including fuel and evaluation a central aspect of the initiative needs to be instrumental at every stage from the awards contest and testing to fuel supply and dissemination an independent agency should be identified to carry out which should occur through and especially through field visits and in this project are identified as the government of india ministry of new and renewable energy manufacturers testing agencies retailers financial institutions local ngos academic and research groups and the each playing a distinct role which must be clarified right in the is suggested that the project management group be identified at the beginning of the first phase itself to facilitate the execution of various activities in the first phase of other components enumerated the recommendations made above had the domestic cookstoves at their focus however the importance of community stoves cannot be undermined and as desired by mnre separate recommendations have been prepared for dealing with community stoves it has been recognized that community stoves also require development of new designs testing protocols testing centres standards and fuel supply like the domestic stoves while some aspects can be integrated with the activities to be carried out for domestic stoves it is desirable to have a different approach for pilot studies for various reasons due to institutional usage these stoves can be implemented more easily among at least certain segments of the users the activities recommended for the two phases are as follows i different user segments and regions for pilot dissemination along with strategies for pilot of field working in identified regions for implementation of pilot an agency for monitoring and evaluation of pilot of baseline data with traditional stoves in the identified sites with the help of field monitoring selection of suitable stove designs by implementing installation of stoves by the manufacturers with the help of implementing and evaluation in the field for at least two months by the monitoring suitable protocols and standards for community

and existing biomass chains for processed large number of people too numerous to be all named here individually have contributed to the preparation of this report through participation in various brainstorming sessions stakeholder consultations and other meetings as well as individual discussions and responses to specific requests for information and feedback this report could not have been completed without the time and energy contributed generously by all these individuals moreover the passion that many of them have for the cookstove made the entire experience very enriching for all of us also would like to acknowledge the work of other stalwarts who have spent their lives working for the cookstove some of whom are not amongst us some seem to have slipped into the oblivion due to failing health and some others who continue to contribute silently to the cause without being in the forefront this work indeed builds on the foundations laid by these people would also like to express our sincere thanks to all the project staff who have worked behind the scenes and made it possible for the report to take this shape work was funded by the ministry of new and renewable energy we would like to gratefully acknowledge the financial as well as other support received from the ministry all as an energy has been used by mankind for cooking and space heating since time immemorial while the gaseous fuels like lpg and natural gas have replaced biomass in developed countries and most urban homes in the developing world half of the population and about of rural households in developing nations continue to depend on coal or biomass like wood crop residues cattledung and charcoal for their cooking and heating data from census indicates more than of all households in india rely on traditional energies for their cooking needs figure over of these households are in rural percentage of indian households using various sources of household energy census major part of the household energy consumption is for cooking traditional cookstoves or chulhas which have efficiencies less than and are known to be sources of large quantities of pollutants are used by most rural households in the developing world for cooking the large fuel consumption of these chulhas results in a large amount of time spent in collecting fuel by these households in such households women and children are often exposed to high levels of pollutants for to hours daily over many there are strong evidences to show the relation between exposure to such emissions and acute respiratory infections in children with estimated two to increase in incidence and mortality due to the exposure to these there have been reports on the effect of black carbon released due to unclean combustion in cookstoves on climate change therefore development and dissemination of cookstoves that lead to reducing fuel consumption cooking time and indoor air pollution can effectively contribute to improving the quality of life of rural women and also contribute to climate change mitigation programme on improved cookstoves the energy crisis of the s improvement in biomass burning cookstoves to save fuel was considered as an urgent need and various organizations the world over started working towards the same several developing countries started national level initiatives to enable the development and deployment of improved stoves the need for eliminating smoke from the kitchen also emerged as an additional focus in these india the then department of energy sources dnes which was created in initiated demonstration of improved cookstoves soon after its inception followed by launching of a national programme on improved chulhas npic in the programme objectives were identified to be i fuelwood conservation ii of smoke from kitchens iii reduction of deforestation and environmental degradation iv reduction in the drudgery of tasks performed by women and and their consequent exposure to health hazards and v employment generation in rural in the dnes was upgraded to ministry of energy sources mnes and continued to manage this programme in the ministry was renamed as ministry for new and renewable resources npic was implemented through involvement of various state nodal agencies in almost all the states and union territories technical and training support to the programme was provided by technical support units tbsus set up under the npic at different universities iits and other institutions of the country more than fixed and portable models of improved chulhas with and without chimney and suitable for different fuels cooking habits and local requirements and using different materials of construction were developed and taken up for installation under some of the models approved by mnes are listed in appendix improved chulhas were installed for family community and industrial applications with the help of state level nodal departments and agencies through their district and block level cells at the village level organizations ngos and workers sew played an important role in the dissemination of improved cookstoves annual targets decided at the national level and then forwarded for implementation at the state level were the main driving force for the programme supported heavily by subsidy the cost of chulhas varied in the range of indian rs of which was met by a direct cash subsidy given under the total of million improved chulhas were installed by under this programme with varying degree of success in different regions in the country some models had better acceptability than others in specific regions certain regions showed greater enthusiasm on the part of the users to adopt new designs for a variety of reasons the programme brought a mixed bag of the programme was formally declared closed in for a new though the npic was formally closed the need for improved cookstoves to reach nearly million rural and households of india has persisted the awareness about adverse health impacts due to unclean combustion of biomass has increased with a need to take effective steps to improve indoor air quality in rural households by providing cleaner cooking options with increasing concerns about climate change and outdoor air quality as well it is no more considered sufficient to remove the smoke from the kitchen using a chimney there is a widely felt need for providing biomass burning cookstoves with cleaner combustion at very low level of emissions and at affordable price the meantime several innovative designs have reached the market with a promise to provide much cleaner combustion and high thermal however the cost of these stoves is quite high which is limiting the clientele in the open market moreover some of them use processed fuel which raises additional requirement of smooth supply of such fuel on one hand it is recognized that clean combustion techniques with sustainable biomass harvesting practices can provide one of the greenest energy technologies on the other it is clear that there is a need for high scientific and technical inputs to develop cheaper and clean burning stoves with long life many other issues related to dissemination fuel supply monitoring and evaluation also need to be addressed with management inputs for effective business plans and sound government policies what started as a purely engineering approach to improved stoves is now being looked upon as a combination of fundamental science engineering production and marketing that is common to most successful product development cycles view of the above mnre has been exploring the possibilities for launch of a new programme on improved biomass cookstoves that aims to facilitate the development of the next generation of biomass stoves for household and community cooking and their widespread deployment with multiple benefits of health mitigation of climate change and energy conservation to consult the community of people working on stoves on this issue mnre organised a brain storming session in march there was an overwhelming support for a new initiative subsequently the initiative was formally launched by the honourable minister for new and renewable energy dr farooq abdullah on december the text of the press release on the occasion of the launch is given in appendix was also recognized by the ministry that such an initiative needs thorough planning which includes building on and learning from efforts made in this area in the past understanding the existing position and assessing the future possibilities identifying the infrastructure and manpower available and preparing proper strategies and a plan of action to help in defining the contours of this programme a project was awarded to iit delhi aimed at carrying out the preparatory activities along with teri delhi and in consultation with other members of the stoves community the details of this project and methodology followed in the same are summarised in the next of this report is an outcome of the months project given by mnre to iit delhi the report consists of three chapters the next chapter gives the summary of the project proposal and the methodology followed to come up with the recommendations which are given in chapter this chapter gives the recommendations for different components covering various aspects of a cookstoves programme including proposal for time scheduling of the various tasks each chapter is supported by material given in appendices the present the government has already launched the new initiative the execution of the same requires working out the actual constituents of this initiative and identifying the strategies for effective implementation of the same it is also desirable that such an action plan is prepared with a very wide consultation of the stoves community mnre awarded a project to iit delhi along with teri delhi to carry out the preparatory activities including literature review and wide consultations leading to an action plan for the initiative the original duration of the project was six months from october to march and was later extended till may was recognized at the outset that any such activity must address the following aspects of a stoves and development of new designs any chulha programme can be successful only if it first targets the development of sound technology suitable for the clientele it proposes to cater to in the current scenario despite several decades of work on development of improved chulhas the scientific knowledge base on design of high performance chulhas is very limited thus the initial brain storming brought out the fact that the new initiative for improved chulhas has to have a approach attract new ideas and creative designs by way of having public contests for improved chulhas support targeted activities which lead to scientific methodologies for design and testing of high performance chulhas protocols and performance standards even though there is performance protocols certified by bis at the international level these protocols are still evolving in view of the new designs of stoves moreover there is a need for setting standards for performance which have to link to any possible government support to a models the methodologies adopted for dissemination of stoves plays a very crucial role in the acceptance of the processing and supply in view of the new stoves using processed fuel this area has gained a lot of significance and calls for an was also decided that the issues related to community stoves may be addressed separately the objectives were then further reorganised to separate the contest from the other technical aspects viz testing and broadly the project was aimed at the of various status reports corresponding to the components identified above view of the status reports preparation of recommendations for implementation covering all aspects of the programme a national workshop for getting feedback from the stoves community on the recommendations and finalize the objectives spelt out in the project proposal are as objective the broad objective is to prepare a firm plan of action for the launch of the new initiative on promotion of improved biomass for a global cookstove contest to leverage international technical talent to develop the of biomass cookstove technologies coordinated by prof ambuj sagar iit of present state of and technical capabilities relevant to cook stoves and preliminary identification of research and infrastructure development activities for the broadening and strengthening of and other technical capacity in the country to engage in research on various aspects of cookstoves including combustion materials emissions testing monitoring standards and certification of cookstoves coordinated by dr sangeeta kohli iit of existing delivery models of cookstove dissemination in india so that the deployment strategy for the proposed national programme incorporates best possible technologies and ground realities coordinated by mr ibrahim hafeezur rehman teri new of biomass processing technologies and identification of existing biomass supply chains for processed fuel coordinated by mr sunil dhingra teri new of status and suggestions for future strategy and plan of action for community larger sized cookstoves outsourced to feedback business consulting services pvt of a joint national workshop in april there were six work elements of which the first five were research work elements iit delhi was coordinating the overall project and was responsible for four work elements corresponding to objectives and teri was responsible for two work elements corresponding to objectives and the fifth research work element on community cookstoves involved field survey with expert guidance supervision and consultancy this work was outsourced to feedback business consulting services pvt ltd the objective of the survey was to determine the kind of cookstoves and used in various regions of the country for meals in government run schools this was to help ascertain the need for intervention in these schools and the impact that introduction of better performance community stoves can have in terms of fuel saving and reduction in emissions methodology section briefly outlines the methodology followed to arrive at the recommendations given in this the project to the formulation of the project mnre had constituted a core group to identify the immediate action plan subsequent to the session initially it consisted of only members from delhi for ease of consultation this group formulated the project being executed currently and hence finally constituted the project team subsequently the core group was expanded by mnre to include other groups intensively engaged in activities and some manufacturers of stoves and machines appendix b gives the list of core group members as on march project was proposed with project investigator pi and two other from iit delhi and two from teri while the pi was responsible for the overall coordination of the project the work pertaining to each of the objectives was coordinated by one as given in figure each as coordinator of a component identified team research staff and consultants were hired while many others were consulted by the coordinator for discussions regarding their component besides extensive literature survey was carried out the main findings of which are briefly presented along with recommendations more details being given in appendices and all met on regular basis both at iit delhi as well as teri to discuss the common issues and review the progress of work besides several meetings were held with the advisor mnre and the secretary mnre to seek their advice and guidance members of the working group for each component are as coordination rajendra prasad rachel veena s sk kirk rohit hemant shweta bhaskar rishabh contest ambuj sagar veena joshi kirk r smith

awarded the feedback business consulting services pvt ltd svati the above list gives the working group including the advisors who gave substantial inputs during the course of the project the recommendations in chapter are a result of inputs from a much larger community of people starting with those who participated in the session in march immediately after this session organised by mnre the advisor biomass mnre sought suggestions and comments from all the participants on various issues related to cookstoves many of them spent time in putting down their comments which have been compiled and included in appendix these comments gave a very useful starting point to the project the project was initiated in october the consultative group was expanded to include many others who were not able to make it to the session but have been working passionately in the area and some of those who would like to be a part of this activity in future thus a large number of people have been giving their inputs from time to time in formal as well as informal meetings during the course of this project some of the project team members also visited the sites of some manufacturers which resulted in valuable inputs to this first draft of recommendations was circulated to the stoves community followed by a consultative meeting held on march the feedback obtained was incorporated in the final recommendations which were presented in the national workshop held at iit delhi on may the present report has taken into consideration the comments received during the national workshop as well thus the present report is an outcome of an open consultative approach with a large number of contributors appendix b gives the list of various organizations and individuals who have been a part of this network work on community mnre has wanted to start some activities for community biomass stoves which can take off more quickly than the programme for the domestic biomass stoves the government schools serving meals to children were considered as strong candidates for adopting improved community stoves if they were already using biomass for cooking the meals for this purpose a survey was planned for some selected regions to be conducted by an organisation with experience in conducting such surveys three candidate organisations were considered through the proper procedures of iit delhi for awarding contracts finally considering various aspects feedback consulting bangalore were awarded the iit team interacted with the team of feedback business consulting services pvt ltd at the initial stage of designing the questionnaire ms svati bhogle tide provided extensive guidance on the same the progress of the survey was reviewed with interim reports provided by the consultant the terms of reference of the work carried out by them is given in appendix b and the final report submitted by them is given in appendix from this survey mnre also initiated a discussion session on january in iit delhi on community stoves by inviting various manufacturers of the stoves in a meeting of the core group on biomass stoves iit delhi had also procured the stoves from these manufacturers which were demonstrated in the premises of iit delhi appendix b includes the list of manufacturers of community stoves who participated in that meeting the recommendations for work to be carried out under the new initiative on each of the components identified above are presented in the next the national national workshop was organized at iit delhi on may to present the recommendations prepared by the project team while throughout the duration of the project extensive consultations were held by each group with a large of experts and stakeholders the workshop gave the opportunity to all the participants to have an integrated view of the recommendations and give their feedback in that light the workshop thus served as a platform for ratification of the recommendations by the stoves community most of the comments received during the workshop have been incorporated in the final report recommendations for the new biomass stoves chapter focuses on the recommendations which have resulted from the last few months of work involving review of the literature extensive discussions the recommendations have been provided in two parts part a spells out the constituents of the prospective programme while part b identifies the implementation and management strategies for the programme including a proposed schedule for various activities required to initiate the programme the work was divided into five components addressing five different aspects of a prospective cookstoves programme the recommendations prepared by each of the groups have been presented in part a in separate sections viz i innovation prize ii technical aspects iii delivery models iv fuel preparation and supply and v issues in community cookstoves these recommendations first focus on identification of the tasks which must be carried out under each of these components to constitute a national programme some of these tasks may involve making choices wherever relevant the range of options has been given for these choices with analysis of the pros and cons of each of these choices these are followed by suggestions on how the choices can be made by adopting a widely acceptable b focusses on suggestions on the design of the entire programme so as to be able to carry out the tasks enumerated in part a the organizational structure that can facilitate effective implementation of the programme has been suggested and specific recommendations have been made on monitoring and evaluation of the programme as a whole with a scope to take quick corrective actions as and when necessary this part is common to all components of the programme besides the sequencing of various activities under the programme has been suggested particularly in the first two years of the brief justifications have been provided for all the recommendations in this chapter selected background material forming the foundation of these recommendations has been given in the appendices at the end of the report may be pertinent to reiterate that the indian government has launched this programme the primary aim of enhancing the availability of clean and efficient energy for the energy deficient and poorer sections of our moreover to quote the document released during the formal launch of the initiative programme is conceived not as a handout to poorer households but rather as an economically sustainable business it is suggested that the recommendations in the subsequent sections be seen in this light a constituents of the proposed innovation primary motivation for the cleaner cookstoves initiative is reduction in health impacts from indoor air pollution although with other important such as improved efficiency of resource use reduction in time and effort to collect biomass with concomitant social benefits and climate therefore we need to develop the cleanest possible coosktoves in fact our broad aspiration as spelled out in the improved cookstove initiative press release should be to deliver as clean a cooking experience as other common options such as lpg although cookstoves are a significant improvement on designs available even a decade ago there is scope for further improvement and this will be needed if we are to meet the health and other imperatives noted at the launch of the requires us to develop the of cookstoves that are as efficient and clean as possible and to do this as soon as possible since every year lost means additional health burdens but motivating the development of these cookstoves is itself a difficult challenge and this section proposes and discusses a new approach towards a global innovation prize traditionally new technologies are developed through funding in that area or by creating markets that stimulate technical activities which lead to the desired goal funding is generally constrained in that it can fund only a few groups and these need not be the ones with the greatest expertise since these latter groups especially industrial laboratories may not be suitably motivated to work on this topic by necessarily limited funds which means that the technology development process takes time and the outcome remains uncertain the other model of creating a market also has limited relevance in the stoves context given the low purchasing power of the group especially the poorest of the poor who would be the biggest beneficiaries of a cleaner cookstoves program and also the difficulty in delivering a standardized product that meets needs of a range of customers unlike a shampoo recent years increasing attention has been paid to the idea of as an efficient and effective way to induce the development of technology in neglected areas by motivating a large number of to focus on a specific specifically this refers to grand to stimulate or technology the is probably the most prominent current examples the million ansari x for the first organization to launch a reusable manned spacecraft into a suborbital altitude of at least kilometers twice within two weeks was won in by burt rutan with his spaceshipone another example is the golden carrot awards sponsored by the us environmental protection agency in partnership with companies utilities and environmental groups where the development of the refrigerator was the first in the arena of cookstoves chinese have set an example by organizing a nationwide contest see box this has demonstrated the potential of using this approach to promote innovation in the development of inducement prizes should be viewed as a potential complement to and not a substitute for traditional funding for research and innovation inducement prizes do offer several advantages market or institutional failures in developing technologies for specific a broader spectrum of ideas and participants by reducing the barriers to a goal to be achieved without having to decide which is the best way to meet that much of the risk to the participants since the award of the prize is contingent of the contest parameters being met capacity of prizes to educate inspire and even mobilize the additional resources from firms and other fact a panel at the us national research council has recommended that the us national science foundation experiment with prizes as a way to promote others have proposed the use of prizes to induce the innovation of or the development of agricultural innovations for the third in order to be successful though it is important to design the contest carefully both in terms of defining the parameters of participation and the goal to be achieved furthermore if the ultimate aim is to commercialize the technology then some thought must also be given to the buyer commitment or a market creating strategy we suggest an approach to develop the appropriate technology furthermore given the complexity of burning biomass cleanly in cookstoves and delivering the resulting heat to the cooking vessels we want as many groups worldwide as possible to work on this problem not only experts in combustion but also materials and design therefore we suggest a global innovation prize that leverages innovation talent worldwide to tackle this important we note that this would not preclude the participation of indian groups if anything were an indian group to win a global prize of this kind it would be a great feather in their the chinese biomass stove innovation shell foundation shell china the china association of rural energy industry carei and the center for entrepreneurship in international health and development ceihd together began to organize a household energy prize competition the partnership sponsored a competition the biomass stove innovation awards to identify rank and recognize the most innovative designs in cleaner burning and more efficient biomass cooking stoves in reasoning was that a competition would focus attention on technological innovation for biomass stoves and help identify the manufacturers best able to produce and distribute stoves that respond to the needs of rural households in china and perhaps in other developing countries as well furthermore stove competitions had previously been a successful feature of nisp suggesting that a prize scheme was a viable framework for achieving wider improved stove dissemination in china objectives to test the ability of new stove technologies to deliver a clean convenient and reliable cooking to evaluate the robustness of the enterprises to raise the profile of stoves by publicizing their ability to meet rigorous test standards to assess the usefulness of the stoves in meeting needs in other countries and to review the use of an innovation prize as a tool for developing and disseminating appropriate competition brought forward several different design approaches from two dozen entrants out of which devices from ten manufacturers were chosen for further assessment each had an established market presence and in a series of laboratory tests designed for the competition the designs were found to have significantly better fuel efficiency and lower emissions of pollutants than traditional chinese biomass stoves identified winners had fuel efficiencies in the standard chinese water boiling test ranging from and ratios of about see appendix carbon monoxide and particle emissions were respectively and gram per kilogram of fuel more than an order of magnitude below traditional stoves these stoves were all stoves in which combustion occurs in two stages with the best performing using an electric blower to stabilize combustion sales of these stoves showed significant growth in the years following the competition see appendix c although by less than total units had been key lessons include a need to pay particular attention to the metrics for evaluation of entries where the need is for parsimony in including relevant characteristics and simplicity in translating these into indicators and the protocols for evaluation that must take local consideration into the possibility of some rewards early in the project cycle and also to the whole participating cohort instead of a prize awarded to one winner at the end of the competition also may be worth drawn from national household stove innovation prize to stimulate market activity in china charron d chen x dunaway j hao f willson b deng k smith kr draft paper under preparation please do not cite or quote without focus on cleaner and efficient combustion while there have been many improvements in cookstoves technology in the past few years we believe that a central focus on cleaner and efficient combustion is required in order to achieve the health and social gains that are the primary motivators for this of the work on cookstove development focuses on the design of the overall product the stove with the design of the basic technology the combustion chamber as part of that process but the expertise needed for the design of a clean and efficient combustion chamber is quite different from the expertise and the process for the design of the stove the former requires a deep understanding of complex scientific process of biomass burning therefore it requires the involvement of combustion and fluid dynamics experts and will rely on tools such as computational fluid dynamics and combustion modeling this is not to say that the design of a combustion chamber does not require industrial design principles indeed it does since the cost and the durability of the chamber will depend on materials choices for example the design of the chamber also requires an understanding of user needs such as power ie energy per unit time requirements therefore we need to ensure that experts with these technical skills are drawn into the process are two possible approaches here one the prize could be for cookstoves which deliver some specified high thermal efficiency and low emissions which can include an additional criterion of amenability for mass scale production another approach could focus the prize on a clean combustion chamber which then could form the basis of different stove designs such modularization is a standard approach in industrial production processes for example car companies routinely develop engines that then form the basis of multiple car designs which aim to satisfy multiple consumer we believe that if we truly are to deploy the tens of millions of cookstoves that are needed to meet the goals of this initiative such approaches will need to be given full consideration it also highlights the need for a multidisciplinary the prize should focus on development of combustion and possibly a biomass processing technology if the wide range in the economic status of biomass users in the country in fact the stoves on the market cost from less than rs to more than rs we believe that we could consider the development of two units a unit that is usable in stoves that are targeted towards the poorest of the poor and then a slightly unit that will be used in stoves that are targeted towards the group with a higher purchasing power need to consider and define multiple criteria a successful design will need to meet the health climate and other imperatives that motivate a new program at the same time other considerations such as safety cost and robusteness will determine their deployability in actual conditions therefore we have to take into account technical performance considerations as well as safety cost and robustness specifications the point of view of health impacts the two key pollutants would be co and particulate matter pm which require clean combustion social and local environmental and resource conservation considerations necessitate a focus on efficiency which also helps reduce pollution minimizing the climate impacts of the cookstoves will also require reduction of black carbon therefore we propose a focus on these four key characteristics for the basic performance begin with the assumption that we want to come as close to lpg performance as possible currently available technologies fan gasifier which is also the most expensive technology are at best about times lpg on co almost times lpg on pm and almost times that of lpg on bc and cheaper technologies fare much poorer all on a basis as seen in table we propose that the pollutant emission benchmark for the combustion unit that can deliver higher performance be times that of lpg for co pm and pollutant emission benchmark for the unit where we will have to compromise on performance somewhat due to an unavoidable could be times that of lpg for co pm and bc given that the unit is targeted towards the poorest sections of society this will need to be based on the unprocessed biomass as fuel with some representative mix to be defined for the test specifications the cost attribute depends both on the feedback from existing programs as well as the general possibilities afforded by delivery terms of costs as mentioned earlier stove models are available or likely to be available in the near future in prices ranging from less than rs to over rs we assume that a cookstove based on the combustion unit could cost between rs if we assume that the combustion unit accounts for of the cookstove cost it pegs the cost benchmark for the combustion chamber at rs assume that a cookstove based on the technology could cost between rs this represents the upper range of the cost that would allow deployment for the poorest of the poor if we assume that the combustion unit will account for about of the cost of the stove it pegs the cost benchmark at rs might also want to include a component for annual running costs fuel and order to set some robustness and durability criteria we recommend that the combustion unit be designed to last for at least cycles with a performance degradation of less than per might also want to set a benchmark for sensitivity to variation in fuel parameters eg moisture should be noted that the parameters and numbers suggested for performance specifications are first estimates and therefore taken as representative of what is being envisaged to take the prize concept forward the performance parameters will need to be discussed and the relevant specifications worked out in detail with clear justifications for the choice of those stove performance from laboratory emission factors draft et al low and high burn et al in case of agricultural residue emission factors mustard stalk combustion in traditional mud stove has been used rice straw has not been chosen because it is mostly used to feed cattle and only about of total generated waste is used as fuel ravindranath and hall et al mustard tur cotton soybean jute stalks et al jetter and kariher et al single values are maccarty measured zero values for ch and from philips fan gasifier assumed efficiency for natural draft as lower focus on multiple elements of prize design a successful contest requires paying attention to multiple elements goal setting prize strategy ensuring impact and activities to ensure successful delivery figure in this venture will depend on appropriate prize design as well as subsequent delivery the prize design process itself is quite complicated involving analyzing and translating the kind of considerations listed in into specific criteria it also involves reaching out to motivating participants setting clear rules for participation and winning the rights of participants the magnitude and nature of the prize as well as the staging and stages of prize development and delivery source additional key issues that will need to be attention or hybrid the notion of the prize is the past the winner where the is the benchmark that has been while this is a standard model and relatively simple to operationalize we might also want to consider a hybrid model where we give a prize to the best design above the benchmark but then also keep in consideration for the next stage ie the conversion of the combustion unit to cookstove a select number of models that also exceed the benchmark even if they win the market commitment amc it may also be desirable to consider an amc as a complement to the prize as a way of stimulating cookstove development from the combustion units this in some sense then becomes akin to a process where the first stage the prize yields combustion units and the second stage the amc leads to the development of cookstoves where again we can specify certain performance and cost partnering with the right organization given points and above we believe that it is imperative to partner with the right kind of organization that has both expertise in developing such prizes and has a global recommendations for technical work in work for development of cookstoves as well as their testing forms the backbone of any programme on improved cookstoves a lot of work went into these two aspects under the npic being a first programme of its kind it was indeed noteworthy that npic involved a large number of scientists social scientists field workers across the entire country for a common cause the main concern at that time was to save fuelwood and do something immediate to make the kitchen hence the approach adopted focused more on the thermal efficiency which was increased by addressing the heat transfer issues supply of adequate air was ensured through pressure drop calculations and the smoke was gotten rid of by the use of a chimney in some designs the improved stoves were in certain regions primarily because of substantial fuel and time saving as compared to traditional stoves and kitchens in case of stoves having chimneys time the perceptions about improved stoves have changed particularly with new technologies in the market which are giving a greater emphasis on cleaner combustion in the device apart from having a good thermal efficiency moreover the consciousness over severe health impacts associated with exposure to pollutants from the cookstoves has increased in the past few years consequently there is a need to have a fresh look at the process of designing stoves using more fundamental knowledge of science in view of the recent developments there is also a need to review the testing protocols the recommendations in this section focus attention on all that scientists and engineers need to do towards development of better and more acceptable stoves in accordance with certain standards the past three decades a large body of literature has been created by researchers the world over which has brought the stoves into the arena of scientific investigation recommendations on technical aspects of cookstoves presented in the present section are divided into three major parts i testing and standards ii development of stove designs iii fundamental work related to materials and various phenomena it is envisaged that different groups will contribute to these three aspects with some overlap the effort here has been to identify specific research and development projects which can be taken up by various groups already working on stoves or interested in taking up the task from now on it is also expected that these projects shall be evaluated and finally carried out in a coordinated mode rather than as individual projects isolated from others the recommendations given below should be seen in this testing and is a very important part of any cookstoves programme in view of the development of several new designs in the recent past the need for review of testing protocols and setting up new facilities has acquired great importance the activities related to testing required to be carried out under the new initiative can be classified under five categories i review of testing protocols their standardization and identification of equipment which should be part of the testing facilities of various kinds ii developing performance standards for certification iii setting up the testing facilities of various kinds iv training of the personnel for testing in the lab and the field v commissioning of the certification centres each of these is discussed in greater detail review of testing protocols of cookstoves must cover three major components i thermal performance ii emissions and iii safety durability and maintainability performance was the first to get the attention of the international cookstoves community several decades ago resulting in the development of the boiling wbt as a simplified simulation of a cooking process the first version of wbt was prepared in a meeting convened by vita volunteers in technical assistance in subsequently wbt was revised and supplemented by two more tests another lab test the controlled cooking test cct and a field test the kitchen performance test kpt vita since then the wbt and the performance parameters it yields have been under close study and various researchers have suggested modifications in the same in aprovecho research centre along with uc berkeley with assistance from shell foundation revised the vita protocols with changes in wbt as well as cct and kpt this version is referred to as wbt since the ethos engineers in technical and humanitarian opportunities of service and pcia partnership for clean indoor air networks have been working towards further revision of these protocols after a wide public consultation this new version of wbt currently designated as is due to be finalized soon this version includes measurement of emissions of different pollutants from the cookstove simultaneously with thermal efficiency the protocol also has the flexibility of being applied to the new types of the stoves eg gasifier stoves or other stoves using prepared fuel however in such cases two stoves of different kind cannot be compared using the results of these tests two of the stove manufacturers viz envirofit and philips have come together to modify the available protocols to suit the requirements of their designs this protocol is designated as stove manufacturers emissions and performance test this protocol focuses on reducing the variability of the test results due to various factors the protocol needs further debate before its wider acceptance bureau of indian standards bis adopted a modified version of the original as its own standard the bis testing protocol also included measurement of as a separate test this test is meant for only metallic stoves and tests the stove only at high power thus not evaluating the ratio of the stove which is a very important parameter for the user there has already been a move by bis to revise these standards a comparison between four different protocols viz eptp and bis has been provided in appendix even a preliminary review given above shows that there is still no agreement over these protocols despite a wide debate there seem to be practical difficulties in adhering to some aspects of these protocols it is also being argued that these tests are not suitable for stoves including some of the gasifier stoves the methodology used to determine the ratio is also questioned by some researchers in addition many researchers are pointing out that the lab tests do not represent the actual cooking practices well enough in a recent paper by johnson et al a new approach is being suggested wherein burn cycles are derived from temporal data of emissions obtained from the field using the traditional stove they suggest that the lab tests for the improved stove be designed based on these burn cycles so as to obtain a much better correspondence between the lab test results and field performance of the improved stove this is an important aspect as it is well understood that wbt does not truly represent the performance of the stove under the real conditions where cooking practices vary vastly from what wbt simulates there are also different opinions on whether a stove performance should be characterized by a single number for efficiency and similarly for different emissions at a given power or should a set of performance characteristics of the stove be provided for efficiency and emissions as a function of the power input or the burn view of the above the need for further work to have universally acceptable protocols arises strongly it is clear that it will require time to carry out this task in the indian context on the other hand in india an urgent need is felt to test some of the new designs according to widely acceptable protocols particularly where bis protocol is not strictly applicable and needs modification this is required for a sound comparison between the new designs and to take the next step towards dissemination of the available designs it is thus recommended that india should take immediate steps towards revising its protocols for the long term and in the meantime the bis protocol can be modified suitably to widen its applicability to new stove designs can help in providing the guidelines for interim modification in the bis of protocols in project review and revision of protocols as well as standards it is recommended that this task must be coordinated by an organization in project mode in association with bis such a project must involve an international consortium including those adept at testing cookstoves in the lab and in the field as well as scientists involved in design and analysis of stoves results of extensive testing of different types of stoves by the stove testers using different protocols need to be analysed carefully by this consortium both from practical testing point of view and fundamental scientific point of view this must be coupled with sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of variability in any aspect of a protocol on the outcome of the tests the extent to which the protocol can represent the real cooking practices also needs to be ascertained these should then result in the recommendations for the revised version of the protocols and standards which can be further subjected to wider public debate involving a larger community working on stoves before being accepted as the revised standards by bis and perhaps also at international levels the final outcome of this project should be a revised version of standards for testing of different types of stoves for thermal efficiency as well as specific emissions as part of the protocols the standard equipment to be used must also be specified with their technical specifications that can help in purchase of the right equipment testing of the new stove designs in the meantime it is recommended that the bis standard be modified suitably as an interim measure after a quick consultation with the stoves community in the country this work should also be coordinated by an organization as part of a project of short duration the group must have a close look at the various recent protocols available at the international level the requirements of the new stove designs to recommend the interim modifications in the bis protocol the latest versions of cct and kpt being used by aprovecho may also be adopted development of performance standards standard testing protocols are essential to test stoves so as to get repeatable performance parameters for a given product for any mature technology it is important to have performance standards for certification it is recommended that these standards be developed as part of the exercise of long term review of testing protocols these standards must cover thermal efficiency emission factors for co pm total and and bc is also suggested that the standards be specified in such a manner that the products can be rated like the star rating of various energy equipments by the bee this would allow a range of products to get certified and would encourage the manufacturers of a certain design with a lower rating to aspire for a higher rating through improvement in their product it is also suggested that the range of performance permissible under a given must be linked to the expected health impacts of a stove having certain power vs efficiency characteristics and power vs emission characteristics it may be essential to emphasize that the estimates of health impacts of a technology with given characteristics must be based on actual measurements in the field with use of sound statistical tools to make the required setting up of testing facilities exercise of revising protocols has to be taken up in tandem with the activity of setting up testing facilities there is a case for setting up three kinds of centres with testing is envisaged that under the new initiative several groups in the country would be involved in fundamental as well as applied research related to cookstoves out of these some groups may have more long term commitment to the cause of cookstove development and may have a larger number of people interested in this activity the parent institutes of such groups may be designated as centres for the facilities developed at these centres as part of the cookstoves programme must be available to other groups as well as and when required it is expected that the groups doing fundamental research on combustion relevant to cookstoves leading to new designs of stoves would need a testing facility particularly for emission measurements for combustion research as well as for testing their own designs for emissions as well as thermal performance groups could also take up the task of evolving testing standards for which such a facility would be essential or else they could collaborate with others working on testing protocols sharing the testing facilities with them these groups with state of the art equipment for testing could also carry out the training of personnel for certification centres as well as field testing centres however these groups should not be given the task of certification second type of testing facility is required for certification of any product such a facility should be independent of the organizations involved in product development as well as the funding agencies these should be paid facilities maintained by private public sector enterprises or government agencies other than those funding the cookstoves programmes any organization developing a new product must get the performance parameters of their product measured at these certification centres performance measurements by only these certification centres should be considered for the purpose of aid or approval of the product by the government agencies it may be made mandatory for stove manufacturers to get the certification of their products done periodically say once in six months for samples from different batches of the type of testing facility required is the one with field testing equipment and with trained manpower for carrying out the same in the field this would be required for evaluation of the success in the field such a facility again should be independent of agencies developing cookstoves and those funding cookstoves programmes these facilities could be provided in the grassroots level ngos who are involved in dissemination of different products but are not developing cookstoves themselves to ensure proper use of these facilities by trained personnel the field testing centres managed by the ngos could be affiliated to one of the centres the field testing centres would come into picture as part of the monitoring and evaluation of any dissemination programme it is expected that first dissemination would be carried out at pilot scale the evaluation of which would be carried out by the field testing centres subsequently based on the feedback from the field testing centres larger dissemination programmes would be taken up which would again be evaluated by these field testing centres it is proposed that several such centres should be setup depending upon the requirement only personnel trained and certified for field testing should be allowed to carry out the field parameters to be tested each of the above facilities the equipment required may vary as discussed the first facility it will be desirable to have all the state of the art equipment to carry out the measurement of the following efficiency as a function of power input or the fuel burning ratio particulates pmtotal and hc oc and bc as a function of fuel burning and safety the certification facility as well it will be desirable to have capability to measure all the above if the facility is setup in stages over time the equipment for analysis of particulate sizes can be obtained at a later third type of centres should have facility to carry out the controlled cooking test cct in their laboratory and portable equipment for kitchen performance test kpt and emissions of co and particulate matter and pm in the actual kitchens of centres of each activity in stoves can be taken up by any group interested in the area centres discussed above are expected to be a few in number to start with any other group widening their activity in the area of cookstoves may qualify to get the status of an centre in due course in this regard they would be different from the technical backup units of the start with there is a case for only two cookstoves certification centres in the country the need for two centres arises for comparison of the tests to ensure that the test results are obtained with standard protocols and are should be multiple centres for field testing as the programme for delivery of new cookstoves picks up more and more such centres can be in different regions of the of setting up the such centre should be only through open requests for proposals these proposals should be evaluated by an advisory body rather than independent experts the proposals should be looked at in tandem rather than as independent the testing centres must be setup as soon as possible and the work to review or revise the testing protocols may take time this group recommends an interim revision of bis protocols for testing till the long term revision is carried out in project mode in association with bis as recommended above training of personnel for mentioned earlier the centres in the country can also serve as training centres for personnel designated to carry out the task of testing either in certification centres or in field testing centres it is recommended that in both these testing centres certification and field testing the personnel must have at least a high school education with a good proficiency in at least the local language in certification centres a reasonable proficiency in english is desirable so as to be able to refer to the international literature on testing as and when required a one week training programme is a must to understand the background of testing of cookstoves as also to learn the use of various equipments and following the protocols scrupulously variability in handling different kinds of stoves must be an important component of the training programmes the field testing training programme may be longer say days of contact spanned over a month or two to include the controlled cooking test in the lab and field training in carrying out the kitchen performance from the above a culture of testing has to be promoted at various levels this can be done by taking up student projects related to testing in educational institutes and generating awareness among users for the importance of testing and certification the local manufacturers can also be encouraged to have their product tested and certified for their commissioning of centres the certification centres to start functioning as a regular testing centre it is important that first a few stoves must be tested at all these centres and also at least at one centre the test results from all these centres must be compared and any significant discrepancy must be analysed so as to rectify any problem in the testing procedure or the equipment only after consistent results are obtained for at least different stoves from all the centres should the certification centres be allowed to operate for their routine field testing centre can also be commissioned for the purpose after the results of the controlled cooking tests carried out by them in the lab as well as the kitchen performance tests in the field on a pilot scale ie for households are analysed and found to be consistent with each other and with the scientific understanding of the research and focus is to carry out fundamental or applied research which can add to the body of knowledge relevant to stove design and performance the outcome of this work could be either creation of public domain literature on fundamental issues which can be used by anybody or it could be used directly by the centres for design and development of better already discussed it is recommended that centres be created in different parts of the country where fundamental would lead to new stove designs with state of the art facilities for testing the stoves in the developing the literature in view recommendations for the kind of projects which should be carried out in future to add to the fundamental knowledge base are listed research being proposed here also covers the health and social science aspects the need for which has been spelt out at the end of this may be reiterated that the research and developmental work proposed here is recommended to be carried out in a coordinated mode with consortia working on different aspects this is in contrast to the usual mode of funding research proposals by various funding agencies of receiving individual proposals reviewed by different experts in the present context a coordinated approach will help in filling the missing links in the bigger picture essential to make a major headway in this are an extremely important part of any stove the high temperature environment to which the combustion chamber is exposed is highly corrosive and hence can severely affect the life of the combustion chamber lining the desirable features of material for stove in high temperature to transport the finished product without damage for portable thermophysical properties ie should have low density low specific heat and low conductivity to reduce transient as well as steady state energy losses from the combustion for stoves can be divided into two broad categories metals and ceramics the literature on materials shows that the metals with long life in combustion environments are generally very costly and not available locally they need special treatment before they can be used for the manufacture of the product however the metal stoves are easier to manufacture and transport are inorganic materials eg silica magnesia alumina traditionally bricks with mud plastering are used in stoves made in situ clay has also been used for stove construction with or without baking however the former has very high thermal inertia while the clay stoves crack in operation unless very good quality clay is used which is not available everywhere view of the above there is a need to carry out more research on materials which can be suitable for stove construction the following topics for research are recommended for further of various types of clay particularly found in various parts of the country for its composition and various properties relevant to stove manufacturing this should include determination of dependence of the properties on temperature the clay can be characterized in raw form as well as after firing the firing temperatures and the firing cycle can be another important parameter with different types of additives in clay for attaining the desired properties this can form multiple projects with different groups experimenting with different types of with other ceramics with different of various alloys of metals for the desired of a material would mean determination of composition of the material its microstructure and the dependence of the same with temperature the material would also need to be characterized for its thermal and mechanical properties and their dependence on temperature properties relevant to thermal behaviour would include density thermal conductivity specific heat and hence thermal diffusivity while mechanical properties would include the tensile and compressive strength and coefficients of thermal fundamental phenomena in a biomass cookstove is a complex engineering device involving closely coupled phenomena like pyrolysis combustion fluid flow and heat transfer the complex coupling between these makes the problem highly and hence difficult to tackle in totality there is a vast body of literature on some of these fundamental processes appendix d gives a selected list of references covering fundamental processes as well as applied aspects pertaining to stoves however there is still a lot to be done in these fields in the context of stoves the need for further work has been discussed here briefly for each of the processes considerable literature is available on pyrolysis the composition of pyrolysis products factors affecting pyrolysis much of the literature is related to pyrolysis of single particles of a material for cookstove design the pyrolysis of a fuel bed is much more relevant in recent years there has been more literature on modeling of pyrolysis this needs to be supplemented by experimental work on bed pyrolysis to determine various products of pyrolysis obtained under different conditions this would be particularly relevant to the design of gasifier stoves fuel combustion is indeed much more complex than liquid or gaseous fuel combustion due to processes of pyrolysis the solid fuel combustion takes place in two stages flaming combustion of volatiles and glowing combustion of char modelling of flaming combustion becomes rather difficult due to lack of precise information on the species forming the product of pyrolysis in a given situation the variation in this can be very large on the other hand char combustion also depends heavily on the surface area exposed which in turn will depend on the way the bed is laid out the rate of pyrolysis and the fluid flow through the bed including effects of turbulence and radiation makes the problem much more complex for the other hand even experimental work is limited in case of solid fuels for design of any combustion chamber using a solid fuel shape of the chamber its area its height and volume if the is are of utmost importance if the combustion chamber has a grate its size determines the fuel burning rate and hence power of the stove if it is a stove without grate as in the case of a rocket stove the diameter of the chamber is important however this dependence is not available in any quantitative form on the other hand the height of the combustion chamber should be related to the flame height there is hardly any literature available on flame height for different solid fuels under different conditions of primary to secondary air ratio gasifier stoves more experimental work and modelling needs to be done to correlate gasifier diameter with fuel burning rate and hence power rating of the stove similarly for such stoves modelling of the coupled processes is required for more optimal designs of flow and heat in a forced flow cookstove the one with a fan the two phenomena are decoupled in forced convection case the correlations for pressure drop and convective heat transfer are fairly however under turbulent conditions with radiation the available literature may not be sufficient for complex geometry of a typical cookstove there is a need to strengthen this information through sound experimental work as well as modelling surface radiation itself is quite complex with participative medium having soot carbon dioxide and water vapour further work is required in modeling of such above picture gets even more complicated with natural convection while at low temperature relevant to electronic cooling a lot of work is available in the literature on natural convection same is not true for high temperature natural convection there is a need for modelling as well as experimental work in this area to be able to generate correlations which can help in designing the stoves whether in the gasifier mode or view of the above discussion the following topics are suggested for further work to determine pyrolysis products for different range of conditions prevailing in a typical of dependence of rate of pyrolysis in a fuel bed on parameters like moisture content of the fuel fuel shape and size bed dimensions and porosity rate of heating work on determination of flame height for different solid fuels as functions of different parameters like grate chamber dimensions fuel size bed porosity fuel bed height ratio and primary to secondary air ratio of dependence of fuel burn rate on dimensions of the fuel bed bed porosity ratio and air of coupled phenomena in a gasifier configuration and parametric analysis for the quality of gas and modelling to determine the role of radiation surface as well as gas and particulate radiation in a typical stove configuration with fuel bed under forced flow of high temperature natural convection with radiation surface and to determine the dependence of induced air on various parameters and contribution of radiation in natural convection above are just broad guidelines each of the above can result in multiple projects carried out by several product the earlier sections deal with fundamental aspects of the various phenomena taking place in the cookstoves for development of a saleable product a more interdisciplinary approach is required here the foremost is interaction with the field workers and the prospective users to understand their requirements from a very early stage of product development and through the entire developmental process interaction with health experts would also be very beneficial from an early stage of product development the development of a technically sound product would also demand analysis of the integrated unit for clean and efficient combustion efficient heat transfer as well as material durability with cost considerations is a very important parameter to be built into the product design process here the issue of centralized manufacturing vs a decentralized one is very relevant in the process of discussions leading to the present recommendations different opinions came into fore on whether the stoves should be locally manufactured or manufactured centrally to ensure quality control of the product it finally emerged that both approaches have to be supported but ensuring quality control so even in decentralized manufacturing certain critical components may be centrally manufactured and supplied around which the local manufacturers can build the final product these aspects significantly influence the engineering design of the final final product must also meet safety requirements must be ergonomically sound user friendly and must not require much maintenance it is also preferred that the design should enable the maintenance of the product by any mechanic dealing with general appliances the stove being designed requires processed fuel work needs to be carried out simultaneously for development of suitable technology for fuel processing if it is not already available view of the above discussion it is proposed that the formation of consortia should be encouraged for product development drawing from groups with different expertise an integrated approach to product design right from the beginning with inputs from different experts is likely to go a long way in enabling development of more acceptable technologies both from the point of view of the user and the technical performance of the research in health and social is also recommended that projects be funded by the government for the health and social institutes to carry out studies relevant to impact of cookstoves on the health and lives of the users these studies must first collect the baseline data in regions where traditional stoves are in use and later study the impact of using improved stoves in these regions on the health and other social aspects particularly of women and technical consultancy centres the design and development of stoves has been carried out traditionally by several groups across the world even without a scientific and technical background the design of a high performance product would demand a scientific and technical backing as discussed above on the other hand a stoves contest does not limit the contestants to only scientific and technical community there is a likelihood of anybody with a good intuitive feel to come up with a good design or at least a design which has a potential to be converted into a good product with some scientific inputs it must also be noted that while many aspects of stove design can be based on the scientific principles the basic configuration has a lot to do with intuition and creativity besides a scientific understanding view of this it is felt that technical consultancy centres which can help the local entreprenuers in improving upon their designs would be of great value particularly for addressing the regional cooking requirements computer aided engineering tools such as softwares for computational fluid dynamics cfd finite element analysis fea computer aided thermodynamic analysis etc can be helpful in the same along with some experimental measurements such technical consultancy centres could be linked with the centres for experimental facilities however for computational analysis the centres should have their own facilities and expertise to provide inputs for improvements in stove design to the designers in the commercial consultancy mode entrepreneurs interested in setting up such a centre may be helped in the incubation period through soft loans by the government to acquire the required computational facilities in terms of hardware as well as software relevant to analysis of cookstoves or else consultancy in improving cookstoves designs could be a part of an ongoing business of an entrepreneur in for other technologies as well many such companies are in the business with large companies outsourcing some of their tasks to these smaller in such a situation the government could help the consultant in acquiring softwares specifically useful for cookstoves analysis through soft loans also the government could provide publicity about such centres to the community of stove developers the consultants would have suitable charges for providing the technical consultancy is also proposed that the government provides financial support to the stove developers for getting the technical help from such centres since many of these developers may not be able to pay for the consultancy charges on their own dissemination strategies for a new improved cookstove the national program on improved chulhas npic approximately thirty million improved cook stoves were disseminated throughout the level of success of the programme varied across the country as cooking needs are different in each region and each state utilized different strategies to carry out the for instance the himachal pradesh program initially distributed stoves designed for cooking on the plains even though the higher altitude of the himalayan villages calls for different stove requirements these stoves proved however the himachal pradesh program learned from this mistake and assessed regional cooking needs after stoves were developed and installed the program was more under npic initially the target specified the installation of a certain number of improved stoves in a state but in the target was modified to cover a certain number of villages in a though the primary focus of npic was fuel conservation it also attempted to increase the acceptance of the stove by raising awareness on health benefits of reduced indoor air pollution it was assumed that if women understood the health benefits of the improved stove for their families especially their children they would be more motivated to switch to the new however in many regions these efforts did not prove as successful as some studies have demonstrated that potential health benefits are not reason enough for some people to adopt new cooking practices so focusing on the health aspects of improved stoves may not be the most effective marketing strategy for every experts agree that npic could have been improved with more systematic quality in addition to this a more robust evaluation and monitoring system would have ensured proper construction and maintenance of cook stoves users in many states might have also benefited from further education about how to use and maintain the therefore it is essential that in order to implement a successful cook stove program the lessons learned from the past initiatives must be taken into consideration when formulating a new program key elements of improved chulha review of past and ongoing improved cook stove programs which can be read in appendix e illustrates that the key elements to an effective improved chulha initiative are as technology which includes and performance standards as already discussed in the earlier market development commercialization would provide sustainability and the need to earn profits would motivate retailers to market the stoves and sell as many as possible for commercialization to succeed there must be demand for improved chulhas currently there is little or limited demand for improved cook stoves because women already have their cooking needs fulfilled by traditional chulhas and are unaware that better options exist therefore great focus on developing a market for improved cookstoves through an extensive awareness and marketing campaign is necessary in order to take forward a more sustainable approach to dissemination production and areas the initiative should start with the areas best prepared to implement it these areas have widespread financial services strong existing delivery channels managerial experience and available production mass production of stoves in or regional facilities must be executed in order to ensure quality of dealers in order to reach as many households as possible an extensive network of dealers must be utilized this network could include entrepreneurs and existing small shops and training of entrepreneurs if the entrepreneur model is utilized entrepreneurs should be carefully selected based on ability and motivation once selected these entrepreneurs must be given technical training in installation operation maintenance and servicing as well as marketing and business financing if villagers must pay for the stoves themselves they will have a greater interest in understanding and using the technology additionally they will be in a position to demand quality installation and maintenance from the stove retailers however the improved chulhas are too expensive for many potential consumers so stoves and in some cases fuel should be made more affordable with incentives for manufacturers subsidies for users loans would be the most important factor in providing financial operation and of users users must be taught how to properly operate and maintain the improved cook retailers should provide repair services to users whose stoves stop functioning properly so that the stoves do not fall into disrepair and end up monitoring and evaluation in order to ensure that villagers are actually adopting and properly using the stoves an independent entity should evaluate and monitor installed stoves if stoves are not being adopted an investigation should identify areas of the initiative that can be recommendations in this section for effective dissemination of stoves address elements through as elements and are discussed in sections and respectively recommendations for commercialization and market development a mass awareness and promotional stated earlier commercialization is crucial to the success of the improved cook stove initiative and market development is necessary to achieve commercialization market research and assessment for cook stoves must be carried out to determine the existing demand for the product factors that influence this demand and which benefits of the stoves should be emphasized in an advertising campaign depending on the priorities of the families such benefits may include improved quality of health due to fewer emissions and time saved from a reduced need to collect firewood and faster cooking time however it seems that many families place economic benefit money saved from reduction in fuel consumption as the top priority so the campaign should focus on this concern furthermore in most households in rural india the man of the house is the whereas the woman is the cookstove user the campaign must focus on both men and women in order to successfully convince households to purchase improved cookstoves order to develop a market for improved cookstoves a widespread awareness campaign to educate potential cookstove users about the benefits of using a cookstove should be carried out such an undertaking which would involve manufacturers marketing companies local ngos retailers and even the users could utilize a mass media campaign demonstrations in the villages and advertising a partnership ppp as discussed in a later section could facilitate this publicity publicity and engagement with the community should be employed in new cookstove initiative to spread awareness widely and effectively marketing blitz should utilize all forms of media including print radio television posters billboards etc in order to reach as many people as many times as possible however many potential consumers may not have televisions so the greatest focus should not be on television commercials all text and audio should be in the local because many villagers may not be literate illustrative graphics must accompany any printed text so that the meaning is clear to all potential users use of technology should be utilized as well for example games on mobile phones have been used to spread awareness to million and similar games could be created for improved cookstoves the vast majority of mobile phone users in rural india are men so mobile phone games would reach out to the of the mass media campaigns should take place on the state level and the project management unit as discussed in part b of this chapter could organize campaigns within each region the marketing departments of manufacturers and retail companies in the partnership network could collaborate to come up with and implement marketing strategies also marketing companies could be hired by the partnership to help with the channels such as schools health clinics and social services institutions reach every village in india these institutions have the greatest influence on behavior change if an awareness campaign could leverage these channels it could directly contact and impact even the most remote communities people visit health and social service institutions they could be given information about the benefits of improved cookstoves and how and where to acquire them this information can be in the form of pamphlets and posters on the walls of the buildings housing these institutions both the pamphlets and posters should employ graphics that provide clear explanations to illiterate people employees of the health and social service institutions should discuss the health social and economic benefits of and how to purchase an improved cookstove with every person who visits programs in schools could effectively raise awareness by targeting children and their parents children could be given homework assignments that increase their understanding of the benefits of improved cookstoves as well as require them to share this knowledge with their families and communities for instance they could prepare presentations and skits with the help of their parents about the health social and economic benefits of improved cookstoves and then perform these presentations for the village furthermore other initiatives such as and swine flu awareness have involved children parading through the streets of their villages carrying signs and chanting slogans a similar activity could be employed for improved chulha awareness these assignments and activities would reinforce the learning after the school day and pass on the message to their communities the ppp local governments should grant manufacturers retailers and ngos access to these health social and educational institutions in the villages these stakeholders would exploit these channels by preparing and implementing the necessary programs and materials potential consumer may be more likely to purchase an improved chulha if she sees how it works therefore demonstrations of the technology in villages should be an integral part of the awareness campaign these demonstrations could take place in schools houses of worship exhibition halls or any other place that could be used to host a public gathering demonstrators should focus on the benefits of improved chulhas and show how the cookstoves work by actually cooking something in front of the village audience while the demonstrators cook they should emphasize how little biomass is required how quickly the food cooks and how little smoke is emitted testimony about how improved chulhas have improved their lives from users who have already adopted these cookstoves could influence a village audience as well project management unit of the ppp could discuss strategies for village demonstrations and members of the partnership network could work together to implement these strategies village demonstrations should be carried out by retailers who are motivated by the pursuit of profit and local ngos which understand and are trusted by the communities advertising would be the most effective marketing tool in rural areas users should be encouraged to tell their social networks about their experiences with the new stove such marketing should be encouraged by the retailers for example the retailers might be able to have a promotion if a woman tells her friend about the stove and then the friend mentions her name when purchasing the stove the first woman could receive a discount on the stove or the order to become recognizable and appealing to the potential users the initiative should focus on branding the polio immunization strategy of branding was successful and a similar strategy can be emulated for improved cookstoves an attractive logo and possibly a simple slogan should be created to accompany every aspect of the awareness campaign celebrities such as star athletes and actors and actresses from bollywood and the local language film industries could be recruited to act as spokespeople and appear in campaign ads thereby bringing more attention to the initiative ideally the initiative should become a household recommendations for pilot new cookstove initiative should start with targeted communities that are most likely to adopt the new stoves these targeted areas can serve as pilot programs the project management unit discussed in part b of this chapter can select the initial communities families in regions where fuel is purchased or is difficult to collect and where stoves are generally used indoors so that smoke causes noticeable cleanliness and hygiene problems are more likely to adopt the new stoves furthermore socioeconomic levels and levels of education should be targeted areas should be selected based on existing strengths in financial institutions biomass availability managerial and technical readiness determined by past and ongoing successful cookstove dissemination projects and delivery channels to table which shows the strengths of each indian state maharashtra tamil nadu and karnataka are best equipped to successfully implement an improved cookstove dissemination project maharashtra has microfinance institutions biomass residue surplus density at least four ongoing cook stove projects and at least four rural delivery networks tamil nadu has microfinance institutions biomass residue surplus density at least four ongoing cook stove projects and at least three rural delivery networks karnataka has microfinance institutions biomass residue surplus density at least three ongoing cook stove projects and at least three rural delivery networks the states include andhra pradesh haryana madhya pradesh and uttar pradesh in nsip regions entered a competition to prove their ability and willingness to successfully implement the cookstove initiative and the best regions were such a strategy is not necessarily the best way to select communities for pilot programs but it should be explored initiative should aim to have several pilot programs in place within the next few years these pilots should utilize a wide variety of delivery models including existing and new models many models must be tested in these pilot programs so that the best models can be selected in future strengths of each strength in financial institutions is interpreted as more than institutions or people and strength in biomass in all socioeconomic levels both and approaches must be employed multiple delivery channels and supply chains should be utilized in each region existing networks can vary audiences methods of delivery types of services etc for instance a big corporation will operate differently than petty the viability of each for cookstove dissemination should first be analyzed for each state or region several delivery mechanisms should be assessed before the best options are selected as different mechanisms would be successful under various circumstances in each region with existing value chains for cook stove dissemination could be created by the various stakeholders in the partnership but it may be more efficient to collaborate with companies and programs that have existing delivery networks the details of a few examples of such companies and programs are given in appendix e these examples are only illustrative and by no means exhaustive strategies from and potential opportunities to collaborate with some of these initiatives include shakti the women entrepreneurs cover a population of about million people in the smallest villages in fifteen states so this network may be able to distribute cook stoves to a huge number of people in remote villages if the health benefits of improved chulhas are emphasized then the cook stoves might fit well with the health and hygiene mission however it is possible that these women already have enough responsibilities spreading hygiene awareness and selling hll products therefore they may be unable to take on a cook stove project in any case a new cook stove initiative should consider leveraging existing groups as project shakti partnership for handwashing with soap although cook stove dissemination probably cannot on a handwashing initiative some of the strategies can be replicated by partnering with state governments or the government of india a chulha program would be able to reach a much greater percentage of the population the program could effectively raise awareness about and create demand for improved chulhas by promoting the benefits of improved chulhas through government channels such as schools health clinics and social services institutions the schools and health clinics could focus on the health benefits while the social services institutions could emphasize the reduced cooking time and fuel this program may not be ideal for collaboration to disseminate cook stoves because the entrepreneurs sanchalaks are male farmers who neither use the stoves nor have the hereditary role of building stoves while information about cook stoves could be posted on the websites it is unlikely that farmers using the internet for agricultural transactions will have any interest in reading about cook stoves however emphasis on fostering and maintaining the trust should be applied to any chulha retail chains such as hariyali kisaan bazaar and tata kisan sansar agricultural retail chains already sell household products so they would easily be able to add improved cook stoves to their inventory if tks is willing to collaborate with a cook stove initiative its training centers and exhibition halls could potentially be utilized to put on technology demonstrations and cook stove awareness programs in the with existing government programs to reach vulnerable government programs already reach out to the most vulnerable populations in order to expand the cookstove initiative to the bottom of the pyramid and utilize a approach links with these programs should be established a few examples include the rajiv gandhi grameen vidyutikaran yojana rggvy rural electrification scheme literacy programme indira awaas yojana rural housing scheme and antenatal care rggvy aims to electrify all households by because an unelectrified house is likely to be a poor one dissemination of cookstoves in collaboration with this scheme could reach out to some of the most vulnerable households a forced draft or blower stove could naturally accompany electrification and would cost relatively little compared to the electrical literacy program the literacy program works toward eliminating female illiteracy focusing on women as the receivers of cookstoves makes sense as they are the users a cookstove could be provided as a reward when a woman attains literacy in fact the cookstove and literacy could act as incentives for each other depending on the priorities in other words receiving an improved cookstove could motivate a woman to reach literacy or reaching literacy could incentivize a woman to own an improved housing scheme an improved stove would naturally go with improved housing also an improved stove would be only a small additional cost compared to the cost of care centres the most vulnerable periods for air pollution exposure are during pregnancy and early infancy pregnant women who attend antenatal care centres are already in the public system and receiving a number of services including education diagnostic services medication and incentives to deliver their children in institutions even the costliest forced draft stove would be about or less of the cash incentives in many states rs option is being investigated in the stove a research project led by professor kirk r smith at university of school of public health that is exploring cookstove dissemination via the prenatal care system including anganwadi centers approximately eighty percent of pregnancies in india are seen by the prenatal care system women receive nutritional information and iron tablets and get directed to a delivery institute dissemination of cookstoves could target the women who come to the prenatal health centers and be limited to first pregnancies of which there are about seven million per year pilot studies utilizing this option are already underway in tamil nadu and potential collaboration opportunities include the khadi and village industries commission water sanitation schemes government schools and the health system use of the stove could be subsidized through any of the above programs for instance for a limited time perhaps one year for every month the stove is used the household could receive a small payment monitoring equipment which is currently available would need to be installed in the hopefully if a woman gets used to the new stove she would continue to use it after the subsidy of petty shops addition to collaboration with these programs improved cook stoves could be sold in small shops that are already involved in selling energy products such as leds photovoltaic products etc tapping into this network of petty shops could significantly increase the reach of the cook stove initiative into remote areas programs have utilized the village entrepreneur model to varying degrees of success see discussions in appendix as aforementioned in section these entrepreneurs can be individual women hereditary potters who have traditionally sold stoves or groups or collectives there is already an extensive network of groups through the country so this network could be leveraged to expand the cookstove initiative to poor households entrepreneurs would have to receive training in cookstove installation operation and maintenance as well as business training such training could be provided by manufacturers and local ngos entrepreneurs since they have the motivation to earn profits should be involved in marketing the stoves in their villages furthermore they must teach their clients how to operate their stoves and provide maintenance and repair recommendations for ensuring servicing and cookstoves can not be fully adopted if they do not continue to operate properly therefore maintenance and servicing are integral to ensuring that stoves will be adopted in order for maintenance and servicing to be carried out effectively they must be decentralized and executed at a local retailers whether they are entrepreneurs groups rural retail chains like tks or hkb or part of an existing governmental or nongovernmental initiative will need to provide maintenance and repairs services as they already operate on the local level also once the consumer purchases a stove from the retailer a relationship is established and regular interaction may take place thus it may be easiest for consumers to go to the same place they bought their stoves for servicing and cleaning will need to be carried out primarily by the users in their homes so the retailers will need to provide maintenance information and training to those who purchase the stoves from them repairs services should be provided by the retailers each improved cookstove could be sold with a warranty under the warranty scheme servicing by the retailer would be provided free of charge for a certain amount of time perhaps the first one or two manufacturers and local ngos would partake in training the retailers in these by women major challenge to successful adoption is that women have been cooking with the traditional chulha for generations a behavior change like this is difficult when the behavior is such an ingrained habit and tradition the role of women leaders such as women representatives in the panchayat and collectives should not be overlooked these women are in influential positions and can have a significant impact on the behaviors of women in their women leaders should be educated by local ngos about the advantages of improved cookstove use and encouraged to talk to the families about these benefits furthermore perhaps these women leaders could be selected as the first adopters in the village after they use the improved stoves and see the benefits firsthand hopefully they would promote the improved cookstoves in their communities these women leaders could even be given the stoves at a reduced cost more reduced than the planned reductions for everyone else or paid a small sum of cash in exchange for their active promotion of improved cookstove adoption among their communities recommendations for financial arrangements for delivery improved chulhas are too expensive for many families financial assistance in some form is necessary financial mechanisms must be put in place to minimize the cost of stoves so that they are affordable for as many people as possible financial assistance for improved cookstoves should be considered an energy security expense as these stoves will reduce the use of subsidies on capital cost program can consider implementing the following no direct subsidy some past improved cook stove programs subsidies were detrimental to adoption and commercialization users who did not invest enough in the stove did not value it and therefore did not make efforts to adopt it furthermore if they did not have to pay for the stove previously they would likely be unwilling to pay much for a stove once commercialization is underway programs including nisp and ceramic jiko stove program have been successful without subsidies in both china and kenya consumers paid full price for the improved cook stoves in kenya stoves were initially too expensive and very few were purchased and adopted however as more companies started manufacturing stoves competition led to innovations quality improved and costs decreased until the ceramic jiko stoves became affordable hundreds of thousands of these stoves have been adopted in kenya and this initiative has influenced cook stove programs in thirty african continually decreasing subsidy that continue to gradually decrease could make the stoves affordable for the poorer consumers while still allowing for commercialization over time cooking efficiency improvement and new fuels marketing project ceinfmp which was carried out from to by the ethiopian energy authority eea and later the ethiopian rural energy development and promotion center eredpc reduced the cost of stoves for users with small and continually decreasing subsidies with these declining subsidies commercialization of cook stoves was slowly and successfully same approach could be taken in india mnre with funding from the government of india could implement a small continually decreasing subsidy for consumers eventually when commercialization of improved cook stoves is achieved and cook stoves are more affordable the subsidy should be removed draft and forced draft improved cook stoves cost approximately inr and inr therefore each stove will target a different economic class and each should receive different levels of subsidies furthermore households below poverty line bpl could receive additional subsidies see table for the number of bpl and above poverty line apl households by state the list includes urban households as the last fiscal year approximately crore indian rupees were spent on subsidizing lpg fuel which is used mostly by the middle and upper classes the current lpg subsidy does not discriminate based on income everyone including those who can afford the full unsubsidized cost of lpg benefits from the subsidy yet the poorest classes do not benefit from any cooking subsidy as they cannot afford the lpg stove or the subsidized cylinders thus money is spent to benefit the rich but not the poor for the equivalent annual cost of the current lpg subsidy the poorest households could benefit from a subsidized improved cook stove table shows under various subsidy scenarios the cost of subsidizing a single stove and the number of improved cook stoves that can be disseminated for the equivalent cost of the current lpg subsidy subsidies are considered for both the capital cost of the stove and the interest of month loans to purchase the stove see the next section for more in many cases all households can adopt an improved cook stove for less than the equivalent expenditure on the lpg number of households below poverty line bpl and above poverty line apl by state or union and nicobar and nagar and and the beginning of the program subsidies should be kept simple so one subsidy scheme should apply to all of india however as new stove designs are introduced they will inevitably vary by region some regions may require more complex designs or more expensive materials than other regions so the costs will not be uniform nationwide therefore after a few years of initiation of the initiative the subsidies must be tailored to each region should be an annual assessment of the subsidy and the subsidy should be decreased by approximately to each year there must be an exit strategy to eliminate the subsidy within a few years so the declining rate must remain steady the time frame for the subsidy changes and exit strategy should be publicly announced well in advance so that producers and consumers are not surprised by them set dates for subsidy decreases will give the producers motivation to quickly come up with innovations that will reduce stove on improved cook stoves such as first oorja stove use pelletized biomass for fuel these pellets cost five to seven rupees per these stoves will sell most successfully in areas where people are already purchasing fuel for example if they live far from a forest or use however these pellets are not affordable for poor households since other fuels including cooking fuels such as lpg are subsidized perhaps pellets and other improved cookstove fuel should be subsidized as subsidy for pelletized biomass fuel similar to the subsidy for lpg approximately would promote the development of an alternative technology that is a domestic renewable fuel rather than an imported fossil fuel this subsidy could over time reduce government costs on lpg subsidies as households adopt a cleaner fuel with service the price of pellets for customers could potentially be less than the price of lpg if the subsidy is structured wisely although it would be challenging to reduce the lpg subsidy under the current political situation the cost of implementing the pellet subsidy would initially be relatively small in comparison because there are fewer uses for pelletized biomass a subsidy for pellets is likely to be less than the subsidy for lpg the pellet subsidy could be assessed regarding its effectiveness in reducing lpg consumption and increasing biomass consumption after several cash transfer for cookstove order to promote use of improved cookstoves a conditional cash transfer scheme could be put into place according to the world bank cash transfer programs provide cash payments to poor households that meet certain behavioral requirements generally related to health care and in tamil nadu a conditional cash transfer program to keep girls in school has been successful for every month a girl attends school that family receives a cash payment families are paid because if girls are not in school they could be earning money for their the cookstove initiative a conditional cash transfer program would pay households a small amount for instance fifty rupees for each month the stove is used the hope is that with an incentive to actually use the improved cookstoves families would become accustomed to and recognize the benefits of the new stove and therefore continue to use it after the conditional cash transfer program ends however monitoring equipment in each household would be required to track usage this could be an expensive and challenging therefore perhaps only the first adopters would be monitored hopefully these households would enjoy the benefits of the improved cookstove and spread the word about these benefits to their neighbors and tax including excise duty and tax vat vary from state to state these taxes can significantly increase the cost of an improved cook stove for example selco sells improved cook stoves with a total tax rate in in some places total taxes can constitute up to of the final to reduce the final cost of improved cook stoves mnre should consider partially or fully subsidizing these and other mechanisms can only decrease the cost of cookstoves to a certain point many of the poorest consumers will still be unable to afford the cookstoves financial institutions such as banks and microfinance institutions mfis can provide financial assistance in the form of loans to consumers who cannot afford to purchase the stoves on their own loans might prove to be the most effective financing strategy for the poor loans could also be provided to micro small and medium enterprises msmes entrepreneurs groups for working capital to sell cookstoves groups already have connections with nationalized banks so they would be a good target for loans a detailed assessment of mfi across different states in india see table indicates that there are a number of states including andhra pradesh karnataka maharashtra and orissa where the initiative can be taken forward with active support from order to facilitate loans mnre should establish connections with nationalized banks commercial banks and microfinance institutions mnre as the catalyst for the ppp should send an open invitation to all financial institutions to join the improved cook stove partnership as members of the ppp the financial institutions can collaborate with other stakeholders and partake in cook stove dissemination activities by providing financial services such as loans if necessary perhaps mnre could provide bulk loans at low interest rates to the financial institutions who give loans to improved cook stove consumers furthermore mnre could subsidize the interest on the loan for instance if a villager owes interest mnre could pay so that the villager only needs to pay table loan interest draft capital to subsidize one stove draft capital to subsidize one stove equivalent of year lpg equivalent of years of lpg years loan not funds crore not funds crore microfinance institutions by or union lakh and nicobar and nagar and and assessment of biomass processing number of improved cookstove models are being used in different parts of the country these models are classified into two broad categories i natural draft ii forced draft new while rural households mainly use fuelwood collected from nearby forests for meeting their cooking energy requirements it has been observed that in order to achieve the best performance from improved in terms of combustion efficiency and reduced use of processed fuels is essential especially in forced draft cookstoves has a vast variety of woody and agro based biomass residues that can be effectively utilized as cooking fuel by rural households however most of these types of biomass require processing in order to prove effective in devices processing of biomass either requires compacting of loose biomass into or downsizing of bigger size woody biomass like pruned branches of trees or like stalks using a simple cutter the sizing of biomass is essential and amongst the most important components of a supply system of processed fuel due to the scattered nature of the biomass their harvesting collection and transportation present major challenges in establishing biomass supply processing chain india the most common biomass residue processing technology being practiced is briquetting technology in which a ram and piston press is used to manufacture briquettes of mm diameter and above the process of briquettes manufacture includes screening drying and pulverizing depending upon the type and quality of raw material the cost of briquetted fuels for use is well justified in industrial and commercial sectors as replacement of coal or other commercial fuels however due to their size and high cost briquettes are not an effective solution for applications other biomass processing technology is pelletizing where biomass is converted into pellets using smaller dies less than mm biomass pellets can directly be used in the improved cook stoves or chulhas pelletizing technology is very popular in europe but the indian experience on pelletizing of is very group has done research on all these issues and has come up with the following set of recommendations for consideration the detailed report with material and analysis which helped in arriving at these recommendations is given in appendix cookstove program for dissemination in rural household applications will need to combine the effects of two thrust areas technological improvements in the stoves and establishment of an assured fuel supply chain for the development of appropriate biomass processing technology and associated fuel supply system the following recommendations are assessment of biomass and currently available processing technologies needs to be carried is an urgent need for research and development in technology innovation and adaptation demonstration and field testing of fuel processing unit should be carried out in selected regions in the development is key to large scale deployment of the assessment of biomass and its processing technologies is proposed to carryout the assessment study in different regions in the country to determine current cooking prices type and quantity of fuel used cooking fuel expenditure affordability and willingness to pay for processed fuels and general consumer behaviour etc this type of assessment study would help in regions in the country where first pilot demonstration of setting up fuel processing unit can be initiated general data is available on the availability of biomass residues in india but this data is rather old an assessment study should be carried out for biomass and charcoal availability in the short listed regions this study would help in gathering information about the type of biomass and charcoal available in the regions quantity available current usage costs and their suitability in terms of physiochemical properties to make pellets the information will help in focusing research and development studies on biomass and charcoal conversion technology and its adaptation specifically for these is also recommended that the existing fuel supply chain experiences be documented highlighting the special features of the technology its economic performance and challenges faced by these experiences this would help in identifying the key barriers and drawing lessons to build and design the research and development in technology innovation and adaptation is proposed to focus the research and development on two broad development of decentralized biomass pelletizing machine is required for the development and adaptation of a biomass pelletizing machine for production of fuel pellets from available the major challenge is that india has very limited experience in pelletizing technology while the european machines are generally of high capacity and are also mainly developed for sawdust the use of is limited hence research should be carried out to pelletizing machines for locally available biomass residues and also evolve standards for equipment in particular the should aim in identifying appropriate existing pelletizing and briquetting technology and of the machines suitable for rural operation in a capacity range of with low input electricity consumption this work can be done in technology collaboration mode involving existing equipment manufacturers research institutes technical development of efficient charcoal production can also be used to produce charcoal a cleaner cooking fuel charcoal production is practiced in many parts of the country as a livelihood option but through the use of traditional inefficient kilns it is recommended that be carried out to develop an efficient closed loop decentralized unit based on agricultural residues further the char can be easily briquetted and utilized in appropriate cooking devices subsequently stoves must be used to conduct detailed studies on the combustion of these fuels including their physiochemical properties and emission levels measured as per the standard pilot demonstration and field testing of fuel processing technologies that evolve from the work on biomass processing should be pilot tested for actual field operation by installing a few in different and studying their performances the detailed performance of these machines should be assessed and based on the learnings from the demonstration phase these can further be improved upgraded and eventually for installation in other entrepreneur development and deployment of the is envisaged to involve community in planning implementation and management of biomass processing system to supply the processed fuels at affordable price to the rural households it is suggested that mnre should explore the possibility of linkage with nrega national rural employment guarantee act for production collection and processing of biomass in rural areas that achieves twin objectives of rural development and employment this would help in reducing the production cost of fuel processing and making the processed fuel to the end users the unit can be operated as a business unit by the village panchayats or as a franchise leased out to an ngo or a self help group the unit will have to collect the biomass from the community and supply the processed biomass as per the cost structure determined by the panchayat should be central to such a rural energy initiative they have traditionally been managing local resources such as fuelwood cow dung and water with adequate training unit can provide a unique opportunity for women to organize and plan for processed biomass production to manage energy enterprises and own them particularly for meeting the energy needs for cooking this can significantly improve the quality of life of women in villages issue which will have to be addressed is the diversion of processed fuel to other particularly industrial activity the industrial use is also likely to raise the selling price of processed fuel adversely affecting its use for domestic purposes this problem would need local solutions with the help of village panchayats here groups can play an important role to ensure supply of fuel for domestic cooking first and supply of only surplus for industrial recommendations for work on community many issues pertaining to domestic stoves are also relevant for community stoves there are also some differences particularly in clientele which calls for some differences in approach while dealing with community cookstoves these have been highlighted community stoves vs domestic foremost difference between domestic and community stoves which has called for a separate treatment for the latter is the difference in the users the costumers for these stoves are either restaurants or hostels places of worship residential monasteries or ashrams caterers suppliers of meals for schools etc the customers falling in the category of private parties are expected to purchase an improved stove while the organizations can get governmental support for replacing their original inefficient devices with the new more efficient ones for private parties the stove can be an attractive investment if they can save fuel cost substantially due to their better efficiency even other organizations are willing to pay for improved devices if they lead to increased convenience thus the strategies adopted for deployment of community stoves can be very different from the domestic ones if the stove performs well resulting in fuel saving as well as reduction in emissions coupled with ease of operation it is likely to be adopted by the users and hence the market forces can be used effectively on the other hand the acceptance of domestic stoves is a much more complex issues due to cultural aspects no financial earnings from the stove and hence initial cost playing a very major role of the women in switching to something new decision making power resting with men in many situations not giving much importance to need for a good stove etc the domestic stoves the variability of fuel can be quite high while in community stoves the fuel is generally purchased in lots and hence the variability is likely to be much less the use of the community stove will be for much longer time at a stretch as compared to the domestic stoves which have much shorter cooking cycles this results in more uniform performance of the community stoves as compared to the domestic stoves and hence easier acceptability and better these differences pose advantages in dissemination of community stoves over the domestic stoves there are also several issues some of them common to domestic stoves which need to be important issues to be addressed in community community stoves are being built and propagated by many organizations in the country just like the domestic stoves they are different from each other in terms of the form of the fuel they use big logs small twigs processed fuel briquettes or chopped wood or powdery biomass they may be forced draught or natural draught based they may be fixed or portable etc however there are no protocols available for testing of these stoves to compare them on any common platform there is a need for such protocols to be evolved for different types of community stoves for lab testing as well as field testing this should include thermal performance as well as emissions testing the current bis standards specify the volume of water used for water boiling tests on large sized stoves however this test does not test the stove for low power and does not account for the impact on refueling rate on the stove performance thus for generating reliable and repeatable numbers corresponding to performance of these stoves there is a need for evolving protocols as was suggested for the domestic evolution of protocols there is also a need to set up facilities for certification of these stoves many of these stoves are and are also made in situ in small testing facilities it may be difficult to build stoves of large sizes unless a stove has a standardized process of manufacturing at least of the critical parts every stove may require certification since any small change in dimensions of the critical parts can strongly affect the performance thus testing facilities envisaged must take into account these aspects standards for acceptable level of emissions for stoves with chimney can be taken to be those applicable for industrial furnaces of similar power ratings the emission standards for stoves without chimney can also be similar to those in industrial environments of similar scales of of community stoves also requires like domestic stoves thus in the plan for capacity building for the community stoves component must also be considered technical support centres recommended for domestic stoves can be used even more effectively for improvement in the design of community stoves since the community stove manufacturers may be in a position to make the necessary investment for the purpose fuel supply also needs to be considered the size of the fuel pieces required for community stoves is generally much larger than that for the domestic stoves thus the fuel supply chain may be different for the two kinds of stoves moreover the community stoves will have to compete with boilers and other industrial furnaces for fuel however due to large requirements in the fuel setting up a decentralized fuel processing unit and supply chain may be easier for community strategies for these stoves would be quite different from domestic stoves as discussed earlier there is a need for identifying several business models which can work for different organizations using the community long term vs short term issues enumerated above have to be largely addressed in a long term work plan however if a pilot programme has to be taken up it has to adopt a short term approach which is not in conflict with the long term one in this regard it is advantageous to develop different strategies for different categories of users meal important category of users of biomass stoves are government schools in villages and suburban areas serving meals to children since the meal scheme is supported by the government intervention of these schools for introducing improved stoves can be taken up by the government on a priority basis to develop effective strategies for deployment of improved community stoves in these schools a sample survey was undertaken of selected states covering different zones of the country the objective of the survey was to determine the current cooking practices in these meal schools and also ascertain their willingness to switch to the improved devices the survey was conducted by feedback business consulting services pvt ltd the important findings from the surveys are presented in appendix survey has indicated a high potential for deployment of improved stoves for meal cooking currently most of the village cooking meals which have been covered by the survey use handmade chulhas similar to three stone fires with purchased firewood in up about of the schools perceive the need to switch to an improved cooking device while in ap of the schools surveyed are dissatisfied with the current cooking device however even in ap only of the schools surveyed are willing to shift to an improved cookstove and only if there is government support in up of the schools have indicated willingness to adopt the new device with government the survey shows that immediate steps can be taken by the government to cater to this need in this regard first question which needs to be addressed is the selection of a community stove from a range of products available from different manufacturers for pilot dissemination in some of these at the outset it may seem that the right way is to carry out the testing of these stoves to select the most suitable stove however it must be noted that in the absence of testing protocols for different kinds of stoves such an exercise will not result which can be compared for different stoves instead for meal cooking the available community stoves need to be categorized based on the kind of fuel they use and the kind of food for which they are claimed to be best suited by the manufacturer a match between the regional needs and the stove category can help in the selection of a suitable device for a given region accordingly a few of these stoves can be given for trials in some schools in that region and monitored closely for months acceptability by the user at the pilot stage can lead to adopting a suitable strategy for ensuring long term use of the fuel by the schools since the government is giving them grant for the fuel the amount of the grant can be reduced in proportion to the expected fuel savings from the stove this would encourage them to use the stoves it may be desirable to make them pay for the stove partly after the demonstration so that they value the community stove strategies may need to be adopted for promotion of community stoves among different users the following steps may be adopted for taking up the pilot dissemination work among other the stoves based on the kind of fuel they use and the kind of food for which they are claimed to be best suited by the regions where the current manufacturers of community stoves have not reached so far identifying the fuel available in these regions and the kind of food for which the stove is likely to be used the stove categories with the regions depending on the food to be cooked and the fuel than one kind of stove can be given for trials in different in a region one kind of stove should be given to at least places in a block for comparative assessment the private parties must be required to pay for at least of the cost of the stove for the trial run while the government can bear the cost of the stove for the government supported monitoring of the same should be carried out by a monitoring and evaluation team designated for this purpose the task should be given to an independent organization the monitoring would involve data collection through logbooks given to the user and sample measurements by the team the team must make at least one visit per week to assess the extent of usage of the stove and its acceptance the trial period can be one to two months at the end of which the data collected needs to be the private parties want to use the stove even after the trial run they must be asked to pay for the remaining cost of the stove on the results of this phase the next phase of dissemination can be planned in the meantime the plan for the long term tasks at hand can also be firmed up and the next phase of dissemination can be linked to the long term b programme management and evaluation a programme of national scale to be effective the management aspects of the programme are as important as the actual constituents of the programme in this context there are some lessons to be learned from the past where certain management strategies did not work very effectively and some learning has to come from other examples where the management strategies have been successful the outset it is important to recognize that a programme of such a large magnitude can be effectively handled through participation from various parties and stakeholders from the government academia research institutes private players including small and big entrepreneurs as has been discussed in part a the proposed constituents of the programme would require involvement of all parties similarly it is proposed that a public private partnership be at the core of strategies to be adopted for management of such a programme specific recommendations regarding the same are discussed in subsequent recommendations for a public private partnership ppp would promote collaboration among all stakeholders on the improved cookstove initiative while allowing mnre to take a facilitative approach members of the partnership could take advantage of each expertise resources and activities to more effectively and efficiently disseminate cookstoves at an affordable price to remote rural areas of india for example a manufacturer or technology provider could seek out and work together with financial institutions such as commercialized banks nationalized banks multilateral development banks regional development banks and microfinance institutions delivery services providers such as agricultural retail stores or other existing supply chains and local governments in order to reduce the cost of their stoves for consumers and gain access to villages through existing distribution channels managing the program through a ppp would allow for facilitation of cooperation and collaboration of all players in every component of the program organizational devise a partnership structure for the improved cookstove initiative the united nations economic commission for guidebook on promoting good governance in was consulted and successful partnerships including the central american handwashing global partnership for handwashing with and the methane to markets were considered as models and input was garnered from the cookstove community at the meeting on recommendations for the new cookstove held on march at iit ppp needs to be established by an initiating agency comprised of a network of stakeholders and led by a governing council an administrative support group would be required to conduct administrative tasks to ensure smooth operation of the partnership and an advisory board would provide guidance to the governing council a ceo and project management unit pmu would facilitate project implementation subgroups with different areas of expertise would give input to the administrative support group advisory board and project management unit see the organizational flow chart in figure agency the initiating agency which in this case is mnre would launch the ppp responsibilities of the initiating agency and clearly articulating goals of the initiative and purposes of the the formation of the partnership an open invitation to join the partnership that clearly articulates the benefits of joining up the governing council administrative support group advisory board project management unit and a sense that the partnership belongs to each and every partner not solely to the initiating the partnership is fully established and operating under the governing council the initiating agency mnre will act as a leading member of the governing council and the key government of india partner council the governing council leads the ppp public members of the governing council could include representatives of mnre the planning commission the ministries of finance rural development and health and the central pollution control board private members of the committee would comprise representatives from a trade association of cookstove manufacturers such a trade association must first be established academic and research institutions leading ngos and financial institutions on a rotational basis additional members can be added as necessary in different stages of the initiative the representative of mnre would act as the chair the committee would meet regularly throughout the year via electronic media such as teleconferences and video conferences with at least one meeting per year responsibilities of the governing council the partnership by formulating policies and process and creating intermediate and the partnership stays focused on its the progress and effectiveness of every aspect of the initiative on a quarterly basis through a rigorous monitoring and evaluation framework and making modifications to the initiative as support group the administrative support group would take care of the administrative tasks of the partnership and work closely with the governing council and ceo of the project management unit it is suggested that members of the administrative support group should not be affiliated with any specific stakeholder and be employed by the ppp responsibilities communications between committees and meetings activities and public relations and website and newsletters and other administrative tasks as instructed by the governing board it is suggested that an advisory board should provide guidance and advice to the governing council and ceo of the project management unit the advisory board would consist of a group of experts in different areas technology dissemination finance etc and be led by a chief program advisor in order to avoid conflict of interest these experts should be independent consultants who are not currently involved in any cookstove projects in india the responsibilities of the advisory board could procedures for knowledge and recommendations from the subgroups on both the issues related to the areas of expertise and regional guidance based on recommendations to the governing council and project management unit pmu the ceo would lead the execution of the initiative with the pmu translating policy into implementation responsibilities of the ceo and pmu partnership members from government agencies organizations banks and financial institutions research and academic institutions technology providers and delivery service opportunities for implementation of cookstove dissemination including selecting targeted issues and barriers unique to various regions and suggesting solutions to address them based on input from partnership members through the communication between members action plans that involve collaboration between market assessment demand generation activities and financing subsidies and who issues subsidies on a activities and progress to governing council four subgroups would focus on different areas of the initiative and be broken into the financing subgroup technical subgroup sales and distribution subgroup and monitoring and evaluation subgroup other subgroups can be added by the governing council as it sees fit all partnership members would be allowed and encouraged to participate in the four subgroups which are proposed to be led by two one from the public sector and one from the private sector the chairs would be selected by the subgroup participants the subgroups would meet regularly via electronic media such as teleconferences and video conferences and decisions would be made by consensus responsibilities of the subgroups guidance and recommendations to the advisory board on their respective areas of with the administrative support group in order to accomplish necessary administrative in implementation activities through the project management unit including contributing regional and on financial incentives subsidies tax credits loans carbon credits clean development mechanism on performance standards testing procedures cookstove certification and distribution on marketing selling cookstoves distribution channels accessing remote rural areas means to ensure and evaluation on project monitoring evaluation of projects and of partnership members the network acts as an informal system to facilitate dialogue and collaboration among stakeholders involved in improved cookstove dissemination and to share essential knowledge and expertise with the implementers of the initiative membership in the network would be free and open to everyone and participation in the partnership is voluntary to join the partnership a prospective member would have to sign a memorandum of understanding when joining a prospective member would indicate the group to which it wants to belong government civil society financial institutions research and academic institutions technology providers or delivery service regardless of group each member can communicate with all members in the network benefits of joining and making connections with other partnership members for potential collaboration on cookstove dissemination project and business informed about dissemination activities through subcommittee meetings workshops other partnership events newsletters forums listservs partnership access to online databases including but not limited to ongoing and completed project sites available biomass by type and location and information about each partnership member recognition for accomplishments in partnership publications thereby boosting of membership in subgroup to subgroup knowledge and understanding on regional issues and different areas of projects with the guidance of the project management unit and collaborating with other partnership fulfilling the responsibilities of each member would be voluntary a member would gain more from the partnership if it participated as much as organizational structure of the organizational funds for this programme would be required at various levels and in different forms it may be pertinent to look at the fnd requirement for various components of the funding for the discussed in section competition with specific design goals and attractive prizes could stimulate innovation it has also been mentioned that china recently held a technology competition as part of its new cook stove program association for rural energy industry carei partnered with the shell foundation shell china and the center for entrepreneurship in international health and development ceihd at university of california berkeley to widely and quickly disseminate improved cook stoves the shell foundation provided the funding for the stove design competition the awards for this competition were cash prizes and publicity a group of domestic and international experts formulated criteria for the winning stove enterprises concentrating on energy efficiency ease of use durability of the stove emissions and enterprise management the stoves entered into the competition were tested according to standard procedures in a special testing facility the tests evaluated emissions carbon monoxide concentrations combustion efficiency and thermal efficiency manufacturing facilities were inspected as well independent experts carried out these assessments of product performance and manufacturing this award program will be repeated in order to continue encouraging innovation and raising awareness about the benefits of improved cook the winners receive access to capital management training and business development support as well as publicity for their products through china and bonus for exceptional an incentive for manufacturers to innovate mnre could provide a cash prize for cook stove designs that perform way beyond the established standards for example biogas support programme bsp which began in july utilized financial incentives by rewarding manufacturers whose products met certain quality and durability criteria with a cash steering committee with the guidance of the technology and financing subgroups of the advisory board could set the criteria for receiving the cash bonus the certified testing facilities would decide whether or not stoves met these exceptional criteria the funding for the cash bonus could come from mnre or a development bank belonging to the funding for technical work is proposed that the government or the catalyst discussed in section should invite proposals for and setting up testing facilities through open rfps to provide grants to research institutions academic institutions and companies developing improved cook stove designs these proposals must be considered in tandem by a single committee which could consist of members from the steering committee and the advisory group the regional subcommittees may be involved for proposals regarding setting up of test facilities is envisaged that the proposals invited would cover a wide spectrum of issues related to stoves and hence it is suggested that funding for the programme should come from various ministries apart from mnre eg min of health min of environment and forests min of rural development min of small and medium enterprises min of science and technology min of social welfare etc once the proposals are put together and the funding requirements are clear the proposals relevant to different ministries must be identified the funding process must be coordinated between different ministries overseen by the steering committee steering committee with the guidance of the technology and financing subgroups of the advisory board could come up with the grant procedures including criteria applications and awarding money for setting up field testing centres the regional subcommittees could receive applications and award grants within their regions according to the steering procedures the steering committee would need to take conflict of interest into consideration when drafting procedures as several organizations applying for grants might participate in the regional subcommittee the funding for these grants should come from mnre and development banks belonging to the ppp the projects are funded and come to execution stage they must be coordinated by the coordinating of the steering committee funding for scaling up difficult challenge for the cook stove initiative is mass production any combination of the following options could be utilized to encourage scaling up production of improved cook advance could provide advance subsidies if a manufacturer or technology provider increases production of improved cook stoves by a certain percentage then they would receive an advance subsidy payment from mnre for example in nepal bsp introduced the advance subsidy against bank guarantees in the fiscal year in order to receive the advance subsidy payment a company must increase plant production by twenty companies unable to submit bank guarantees could take advantage of a working capital revolving fund these companies receive credit when they purchase components for biogas governing council would consult with the technology and financing subgroups to establish the production criteria required to earn an advance subsidy the project management unit would determine if a manufacturer met these criteria the funding for the advance subsidy would come from mnre or a development bank production tax credit and the partnership could implement production tax credits in order to support mass production production tax credits have bolstered the wind energy sector in the united states for every of electricity produced wind energy companies receive a credit towards their income taxes because some companies do not earn enough income for this tax credit to be much of an incentive this credit can be exchanged for a grant of up to thirty percent of the property value improved cook stove ppp could implement a similar production tax credit scheme for instance for every certain number of stoves produced a manufacturing company could receive a certain amount of tax credit or choose to take a grant of up to a certain percentage of the manufacturing property value instead the governing council would determine the value of the production tax advance market commitment and government procurement advance market commitment from the government would ensure a market for products mnre another government partner could commit to purchasing a large number of stoves perhaps one million and then disseminate the stoves themselves through various existing government channels and programs this advance market commitment would motivate manufacturers to scale up production because they would have a guaranteed government could request bids from the private sector for large purchases of cookstoves at least several lakhs and potentially several crores after some time to be distributed via the various programs mentioned earlier in section the stoves to be selected must meet rigorous quality performance and cost standards and criteria if several stoves meet these requirements then targeted households could have choices in which stoves they prefer preferences would give useful information for future stove the government could procure cookstoves for its own operations this is a relatively common practice to reduce costs and drive technology development for instance some governments procure vehicles for their operations some good possibilities for procurement of cookstoves for government operations include indian railways aganwadi centres the indian army and schools that are part of the midday meal development mechanism and carbon addition to subsidies and incentives for manufacturers the clean development mechanism cdm and carbon credits should be considered for financing improved cookstoves are an application of cdm because they are relatively simple and have a relatively quick payback cdm projects encourage cooperation among government agencies private companies and academia such cooperation is critical to the success of a cook stove initiative and the ppp ningxia province china a cdm project executed jointly by ningxia fenlian co ltd and the environmental center of tsinghua university is distributing solar cookers to rural agrarian families because this project is expected to save million metric tons of coal over ten years of implementation it was eligible for cdm similarly the potential fuelwood and carbon emission savings should qualify cook stove initiative for cdm funding these potential savings must first be calculated and a robust monitoring and evaluation process that will feed into a comprehensive database must be established credits would encourage private sector participation in yanqing county china in the camco group and pioneer carbon cooperating with the county government took advantage of carbon financing to disseminate one million daxu stoves within three years thereby removing twenty eight million metric tons of carbon emissions during the first five years the camco group and pioneer carbon have the rights to the carbon credits and they use these credits to minimize the retail cost of the daxu mnre and the ppp decide to pursue cdm and carbon trading the governing council with the help of the financing subgroup could put together a task force to calculate the potential carbon savings prove additionality set up monitoring and evaluation procedures and an accompanying database and apply to the designated national authority and cdm executive board for approval and registration the money earned from selling carbon emissions reduction certificates could be used to fund any combination of the financial incentives mentioned in this revolving fund could be established to fund various dissemination activities including awareness raising education of users training of retailers etc the fund could be set up as a collaborative effort by members of the ppp if necessary the governing council or project management unit with the help of the financing subgroup could establish a task force to institute the revolving fund the initial seeding for the revolving fund could be provided by nationalized and commercial banks and the various stakeholders could take out loans for dissemination activities stakeholders should be required to be members of the partnership network in order to take out a loan revolving fund could also play an important role for cdm no financing or cers from cdm are received for the first year after registration the revolving fund could fill this gap and finance activities such as monitoring and evaluation once cdm funding comes in after the first year the revolving fund can be paid should not be expected that the revolving fund will receive much return in the beginning it may take some time for the improved cookstove industry to mature and for manufacturers and retailers to accrue enough profit to pay back the revolving monitoring and is desirable to distinguish between monitoring and evaluation of the programme as a whole and that of individual constituents in particular the monitoring of the contest the activities the testing aspects dissemination of the stoves in any region the fuel supply each of these components would require of every project at a very close level the kind of monitoring required would also vary from component to component for example the progress of activities would be gauged through presentations and consultations and through visit of these facilities however the success of dissemination activities can be gauged essentially through field visits and field level monitoring in view of this it is important that parameters required for monitoring the individual constituents as well as the programme as a whole be clearly identified by the steering committee and the advisory group subsequently monitoring teams can be identified at various levels and the periodicity of monitoring of every component and the programme can also be decided also has to be recognized that finally the success of the programme should be visible in greater usage of the stoves and in positive health impacts so the field level monitoring would form a very crucial part of the overall monitoring exercise in this context some recent developments have made the process easier as given microchip and personal computer revolutions are offering ways to monitor and evaluate programs covering millions of households such small smart fast and cheap monitoring is crucial for modifying programs to optimize effectiveness as well as demonstrating benefits to funders such devices include an inexpensive particle and temperature monitor based on smoke alarm technology pats which is used to monitor indoor air pollution levels before and after introduction of improved stoves and an monitor tams which is used to document behavior for example changes in cooking patterns when improved stoves are introduced for introductions of stove the most promising device is the monitoring system sums that measures and records stove usage with a small datalogging temperature monitor which is now being linked to cell phone networks not only does the sums allow verification of usage but it also facilitates understanding of adoption patterns eg what kind of households are more likely to adopt which not and why in addition by providing a measure of monthly usage it makes possible the application of conditional cash transfer methods to promote effective roles of the major order to effectively fulfill the above requirements of a cook stove initiative each stakeholder must understand its role in the program the major stakeholders are ministry of new and renewable energy mnre manufacturers retailers marketing company financial institutions and local ngos the potential roles for the stakeholders are summarized in table ministry of new and renewable energy the government ministry taking the lead on improved cook stove dissemination the ministry of new and renewable energy mnre must initiate and regulate the cook stove program by playing a catalyzing role and putting in place mechanisms that would facilitate the progress necessary tasks include establishing a common vision for the stakeholders setting chulha performance standards facilitating marketing and education selecting targeted areas implementing financial mechanisms such as incentives or subsidies and creating a framework for monitoring and evaluation the catalyst of the ppp mnre needs to establish a common vision with shared objectives for all the stakeholders to follow if shared objectives are not established the cook stove initiative may not be carried out as effectively in order to avoid these issues each stakeholder must have the same understanding of the program goals even though each may have its own additional objectives for instance a manufacturing company may have its own goal to beat out the competition as the number one stove mnre must publicize the mission to the stakeholders through press releases newsletters documents on its website and to known stakeholders communication between mnre and the stakeholders is essential in determining and working together toward these objectives this communication can be carried out through a partnership which is discussed earlier in this roles of stakeholders in a new improved chulha a common vision for all cook stove performance standards and testing marketing and targeted financial a framework for monitoring and affordable stoves that reduce fuel consumption smoke and cooking and development that focuses on cooking distribution channels or take advantage of existing technical training programs for retailers and mnre procedures to seek out tests to determine if stoves meet performance improved chulhas to village stoves through demonstrations in users on proper operation and and service stoves that do not function loans to business and accounting training to manufacturers in assessment of cooking village training to in marketing and demonstrations in order to ensure quality of the stoves mnre must set and enforce chulha performance standards and testing procedures for a stove to qualify for the program it should meet certain fuel consumption and emissions must facilitate demand generation for market development through a vast awareness mnre may be able to provide funds for the publicity and hire a marketing company to execute a mass media campaign television radio print furthermore through the ppp mnre may be able to arrange with other government agencies to grant the marketers access to government channels in order to extend the reach of awareness efforts see recommendations for a mass awareness and promotional campaign a more detailed section on marketing new cook stove initiative should start with targeted communities that are best prepared to carry out a successful cook stove program these targeted areas can serve as pilot programs and the steering committee and regional subcommittees with the leadership of mnre should select these communities based on the criteria mentioned above in key elements of improved chulha dissemination see recommendations for initial focus of the delivery programme above for more details on selecting targeted should put into place a series of financial incentives for manufacturers that would promote research and development and mass production subsidies for the user a variety of options are given in recommendations for financial arrangements for delivery above and mnre should choose which financial mechanisms to implement from among these options loans are the most important means to enable poor consumers to purchase improved chulhas so mnre should establish links with financial institutions including commercial banks nationalized banks and microfinance institutions that operate in each state mnre and these financial institutions can work together through the partnership as discussed in section mnre could create a framework for monitoring and evaluation of the cook stove initiative to ensure that stakeholders are effectively fulfilling their roles and those stoves are actually being adopted and used however an uninvolved third party should carry out the evaluations primary role is to produce affordable stoves that reduce fuel consumption emissions and cooking time as part of the research and development the manufacturers should assess the cooking needs of various communities so that they can design appropriate stoves users are more concerned with cooking time and fuel consumption than with health therefore when designing the fuel inputs manufacturers should consider the time constraints and be careful not to add any work some stoves such as those used in improved cook stove program may require women to cut pieces of fuelwood into small pieces however this may be and some women may not have the appropriate tools in kenya many women did not adopt these stoves because of the additional manufacturers must also distribute and sell the stoves to the retailers distribution strategies will vary depending on who the retailers are see the section retailers above but the manufacturers either need to create new distribution channels or take advantage of existing addition to producing and distributing stoves the manufacturers should create training programs they should provide the retailers with installation operation maintenance and servicing training they should also train the retailers to carry out technical demonstrations in villages and to give operation and maintenance education to the users if the manufacturers themselves do not train the retailers local ngos might in some cases then they should train the testing agencies would carry out the tests required to determine if a stove meets the performance standards for the improved cook stove initiative they would need to seek accreditation from mnre and follow the necessary procedures set by mnre this has been detailed in section retailers job is to sell the improved chulhas to village households in order to keep the retailer motivated the stoves must be sold at a profitable yet affordable price once the stoves are sold the retailers should educate the users on proper operation and maintenance of the stoves also the retailers should repair and service stoves that stop functioning the retailers are motivated to earn profits they should be involved in marketing the chulhas in the villages in which they conduct their businesses the retailers as part of their marketing schemes should carry out demonstrations of the technology in the villages perhaps with the assistance of the manufacturing company a local ngo furthermore the retailers should encourage advertising among the are multiple options for who the retailers could be many programs have utilized the village entrepreneur model to varying degrees of success see discussions in appendix as aforementioned in key elements these entrepreneurs can be individual women hereditary potters who have traditionally sold stoves or groups of women working together existing small shops could start selling the stoves a network of dealers could combine various types of entrepreneurs and shops addition to or instead of creating new delivery networks an improved chulha initiative may be able to take advantage of networks and move forward by collaborating with some programs that have already created dissemination channels such programs include hindustan lever project shakti and global on handwashing with soap and agricultural retail chains such as hariyali kisaan bazaar and tata kisan sansar all of these are described in appendix more details about how strategies from these initiatives described in appendix e can be applied to a cook stove program see recommendations for grassroots value chain for stove delivery above financial institutions such as banks and microfinance institutions mfis should provide financial assistance to consumers who cannot afford to purchase the stoves on their own from the perspective it is the institutions that will be the most critical for taking the cook stove initiative forward see recommendations for financial arrangements for delivery above for more financial institutions might also be able to give business and accounting training to the retailers at the village level if they do not give the training directly to the retailers they might be able to provide local ngos or other entity with training materials so that another player could train the retailers local ngos might be able to provide valuable insights into the socioeconomic dynamics of the villages in which they work established ngos may be respected and trusted by the villagers thus they may have greater capacity to work more closely with villagers to disseminate improved cook manufacturers carry out an assessment of cooking needs local ngos may be able to assist in the surveys if the entrepreneur model is employed local ngos can identify groups or select individuals who show the drive and ability to successfully sell the stoves the ngos with the help of the manufacturers for technical knowledge and financial institutions for business knowledge may be able to provide training to these retailers moreover local ngos can perhaps assist in marketing and facilitate or participate in demonstrations in villages the capabilities of ngos vary widely while some ngos may be able to successfully execute the aforementioned tasks some might already have too much work to accomplish and others simply might not possess the necessary skills and tools collaboration with local ngos should certainly be explored but it may not always be possible or mnre and the ppp decide to pursue cdm and carbon trading the steering committee with the help of the advisory financing subgroup could put together a task force to calculate the potential carbon savings prove additionality and apply to the designated national authority and cdm executive board for approval and registration the money earned from selling carbon emissions reduction certificates could be used to fund any combination of the aforementioned financial summary of recommendations this section the major recommendations made in the earlier section have been summarized for ready global suggest an approach to develop the appropriate technology we also recommend that this prize be central focus on cleaner and efficient combustion is required in order to achieve the health and social gains that are the primary motivator for this the basic technical performance specifications for the cookstove prize should be based on four key parameters carbon monoxide co particulate matter pm efficiency and black carbon additionally have to consider cost and as additional the complexities of the prize design process partnering with the right organization to develop the prize is absolutely critical this organization must have both expertise in developing such prizes and has a global technical is a need for a coordinated project to review and revise the standards and testing protocols for cookstoves with international consultation in the meantime an interim modification to the bis standard is recommended so as to enable one of the latest protocols available internationally should be adapted and used in the testing centres recommended in this report as an interim development of standards for certification should be linked to health impacts of the stove with a given performance the certification can be in the form of as is being done for various energy devices by testing protocols can consider generation of performance characteristics for a stove relating thermal performance and emissions to the burn types of testing centres are recommended to be set up as part of the new initiative i in laboratories for cookstoves ii certification facilities run by independent organizations iii field testing facilities with grassroot level ngos order to do research on the fundamental scientific principles underlying the design and operation of cookstoves it is recommended that coordinated projects involving research groups across the country should be funded some of these groups could graduate into centres for stoves on the basis of their of new products requires interdisciplinary groups enabling linkages between technical experts the users the field workers understanding the needs of the users and also the manufacturers so as to incorporate several essential inputs at the product design stage order to help stove developers in conducting fundamental analysis of the new designs technical consultancy centres possibly linked to any of the centres could be set up to operate in commercial consultancy mode up of centres recommended above as well as funding of projects should be carried out only through open request for proposals evaluated by an advisory delivery an improved cook stove initiative to be sustainable commercialization must be encouraged market development is in turn integral to promoting commercialization a widespread awareness campaign that leverages all forms of media on a massive scale various government channels such as schools and health and social services institutions village demonstrations and advertising among village families and is branded with a recognizable logo and celebrity endorsements would be the best strategy to develop the improved cook stove market a technology is adopted for wide dissemination its assessment and certification must be carried out the certification which is expected to be based on rigorous lab level tests could be the basis of technology selection for pilot level programmes the technology selection for wider dissemination should be based on evaluation of the pilot level programmes the performance of the technology selected must be above a minimum threshold as decided at the appropriate ensure effectiveness in the initial stages of the program it should be carried out in the regions first these targeted areas should be selected based on a variety of strengths including the presence of financial institutions biomass availability managerial and technical readiness determined by past and ongoing successful cookstove dissemination projects and delivery channels maharashtra tamil nadu and karnataka meet these order to reach as many households as effectively and efficiently as possible an extensive network of various types of dealers must be utilized this network could include entrepreneurs and shop owners rather than solely create new delivery networks it may be more efficient to take advantage of existing value chains as well these value chains could be leveraged through collaboration with existing programs such as project shakti and others agricultural retail chains such as hariyali kisaan bazaar and tata kisan sansar and petty the perspective financing an improved cook stove is the greatest challenge there are two options for user subsidies no direct subsidy or a continually decreasing subsidy for the equivalent expenditure on the current annual lpg subsidy cook stoves can be disseminated to every household in rural india under various subsidy households that cannot afford to purchase a stove even after subsidies should be able to receive loans mnre should establish linkages with institutions that can provide these loans such as nationalized banks commercial banks and microfinance institutions additionally as loans often have steep interest rates and many borrowers may not be able to afford the interest interest payments could be partially or fully financial assistance should be linked with the performance of the technology as well as the affordability level of the order to encourage production mnre could offer a advance subsidy or a production tax credit to receive an advance subsidy payment a manufacturer must increase production of cook stoves by a certain percentage under a production tax credit scheme for every certain number of stoves produced a manufacturing company could receive a certain amount of tax credit or choose to take a grant of up to a certain percentage of the manufacturing property value revolving fund could finance other dissemination activities such as awareness raising education of users training of retailers etc the initial seeding for the revolving fund could be provided by nationalized and commercial banks or mnre and various stakeholders which should be members of the partnership could take out loans for dissemination clean development mechanism cdm and carbon credits should be considered for funding the initiative the potential fuelwood and carbon emission savings should qualify cook stove initiative for cdm funding the money earned from selling carbon emissions reduction certificates could be used to fund any combination of the aforementioned activities or financial incentives furthermore carbon credits would encourage private sector participation if manufacturers have the rights to the carbon credits they could use these credits to minimize the retail cost of their stoves fuel cookstoves programme must have a dual thrust on technological improvement in stoves as well as establishment of an assured fuel supply chain the latter is critical to dissemination of devices with rural household has an immense variety of biomass residues transforming them into processed fuels for use with improved cookstoves is crucial to extracting the best performance combustion efficiency and reduced emissions from this initiative pelletizing will be more suitable than briquetting whose size and cost constrains its use in household extensive study on the availability of biomass residues surveying type quantity seasonal variations costs and suitability for pelletization is required as existing data is quite is required for the development of biomass pelletizing machines for production of fuel pellets from available suitable for decentralized operation with a capacity of and with low electricity requirement besides standards need to be evolved for such machinery the research and development of an efficient and improved closed loop decentralized charcoal making unit operating on agricultural residues is field deployment and testing of these fuel processing units in varied regions will allow a detailed assessment of their performance involving the local community in the various operational aspects of the biomass processing unit will integrate and embed this initiative deep into the context of the field energy environment also offering immense possibilities for fostering participation and community stoves differ from domestic units in being used in community and commercial environments where multiple meals for a much larger number of people are prepared with a greater frequency deployed in restaurants hostels places of worship and ashrams caterers and suppliers of meals their constituency of users and the scale and intensity of resource use implies that different dissemination trategies pitching convenience and fuel savings must be identified for different numerous community stove designs exist with large variations in the operation and type of fuel used protocols to test these devices on a common platform are lacking and must be prioritized up of facilities for the certification of designs and devices and the for these stoves should be coupled with the facilities being planned for the domestic stoves the development of high performance community stoves can particularly benefit from the technical support centres which are recommended for the domestic stoves and implementing the decentralized fuel supply chain will be a crucial aspect of the community cookstoves program and given the significantly larger scale at which these units function it may be easier to accomplish this for community stoves than similarly focused initiatives for the domestic survey conducted by feedback consulting services pvt ltd which examined the practices at schools in villages and suburban areas reported that nearly all schools visited use locally made stoves similar to a three stone fire majority of those polled indicated a willingness to shift to an improved cookstove but would need government support to enable the strategies beginning with pilot programmes must take fuel and food types into account map markets current unexplored by manufacturers focus on extended and extensive testing and have integral monitoring and evaluation components all of these especially will be crucial for the strategy the success of this initiative depends programme the activities and programs emerging from the national biomass cookstoves initiative in the partnership model at all levels will ensure that participants government organizations industry academic and social sector entities can leverage each expertise and is suggested that to catalyze the nbci the ministry of new and renewable energy in its facilitating capacity initiate and mobilize a steering committee assisted by an administrative support members of the steering committee apart from government administrators must include independent consultants who can be paid for coordinating the entire initiative the steering committee can draw on the counsel of the advisory board whose constituents will be financing technical sales and distribution and monitoring and evaluation should be disseminated by regional committees which will lead activities in the eight physiographic regions of india reflecting prevailing patterns of biomass availability and cooking practices across the country committees can be constituted with a mechanism one from the public sector and one of the private sector should engage in ppps identify dissemination strategies collaborations opportunities and issues and report to the steering committee they can also facilitate the network of partnership members for dialogue and collaboration amongst stakeholders involved in the cookstoves is required from various government ministries industry sources for the awards competition technical testing protocols and facilities dissemination training electronic print and contact publicity and and evaluation a central aspect of the initiative needs to be instrumental at every stage from the awards contest and testing to fuel supply and dissemination it should occur through and especially through field visits and in this project are identified as the government of india ministry of new and renewable energy manufacturers testing agencies retailers financial institutions local ngos academic and research groups and the each playing a distinct role which must be clarified right in the proposed scheduling of the the above sections present the recommendations individually for each component of the programme needless to say they all have to be dovetailed together in a logical sequence from that perspective it is suggested that the activities identified above be carried out in two phases phase i comprising of the tasks which need to be started immediately so as to prepare the ground for the long term activities to be undertaken in phase ii it is also presumed that the activities related to community stoves would be carried out separately from those for domestic stoves thus the scheduling of activities for the two types of stoves is given activities for domestic phase should start with setting up a partnership through a governing council a ceo for the initiative and a project management unit subsequently the task for setting up interim protocols must be taken up followed by selection of available stove designs and identification of regions for pilot dissemination there need to be a few pilot programmes to experiment with different delivery models detailed information from the entrepreneurs already in the field about their experiences must be obtained prior to this task so as to plan more effective pilots monitoring and evaluation of the pilots would also need to be done the above the steps required to launch a contest need to be taken up in this phase the ground work for setting up testing facilities and centres must also start in this phase on fuel front efforts should be made to identify small scale pelletising technologies already available these must be tested in the field and improved upon with the help of technical experts so as to make them suitable for wider dissemination this task needs to be taken up on a priority basis so that stoves which need processed fuel can be also be used for pilot dissemination summary of tasks recommended to be carried out in phase i is given below set of activities must precede the activities listed in b and of the partnership ppp by an initiating agency comprising of a network of stakeholders and led by a governing council up a project management unit pmu with a ceo an administrative support group and an advisory board up regional linkages for project implementation by the project management up linkages with various ministries funding agencies private partners so as to mobilize funds for various activities these activities are required to be carried out in a certain sequence so as to lead to pilot dissemination modifications in the bis testing protocol in quick consultation with the stoves of stove designs for pilot dissemination in selected regions with the help of modified testing of regions suitable for pilot study and conducting baseline surveys for energy consumption with traditional dissemination strategies for different regions viz direct or indirect subsidies modes of creating user awareness and linkages with banks and mfis establish revolving out awareness campaigns and village of stoves through collaborative supply appropriate pelletizing technology available in the country which could be disseminated directly or could be quickly upgraded field testing of the technology and its upgradation with the help of technical expertise if required dissemination of these machines along with the pilot dissemination of stoves as suggested above to use different local agency for and evaluation of the pilot this set of activities are required for the innovation initiating the process of prize design with a launching the evaluation of the entries at the end of the contest these activities are required to be taken up in the first phase as a first step leading to the phase ii of the programme for long term initiating the process of developing testing protocols and standards for long term applicability call for eois for setting up the different testing call for eois for setting up consortia to do research related to stoves and development of new call for eois to set up technical consultancy centres to help stove designers for improving their survey of biomass availability present level utilization cost etc for selected regions in the by the time this phase starts it is expected that new protocols would have been identified and hence the testing centres initiated in the first phase can get into full operation centres with testing facilities can start regular training of personnel from the commercial testing centres as well as field testing centres the certification centres can carry out the testing in accordance with standards with the services of the field testing centres would be required for evaluating the performance of the improved stoves in the field after a pilot programme first and later as part of any full scale dissemination the formation of consortia the research activities can be funded and would continue into phase ii while giving valuable inputs in the development of new stove designs by the technical is also recognized that there are many stove manufacturers who can develop potentially good stove designs intuitively but they would need technical support to improve upon their designs in order to help stove developers in conducting fundamental analysis of the new designs technical consultancy centres possibly linked to any of the centres could be facilitated to operate in commercial consultancy mode this aspect is particularly important to address some of the specific regional cooking needs strategies for large scale on regular design and development of new pelletizing machines and charcoal development and setting up commercially viable fuel processing units and supply operation monitoring and upgradation as per community i different user segments and regions for pilot dissemination along with strategies for pilot of field working in identified regions for implementation of pilot an agency for monitoring and evaluation of pilot of baseline data with traditional stoves in the identified sites with the help of field monitoring selection of suitable stove designs by implementing installation of stoves by the manufacturers with the help of implementing and evaluation in the field for at least two months by the monitoring suitable protocols and standards for community development of better designs using technical knowhow potential interaction to enable commercial mode of operation and evaluation of the programme by an independent new cook stove program must incorporate the lessons learned from the successes and failures of past and ongoing dissemination programs these lessons demonstrate that the key elements of an effective cook stove initiative include technology research and development performance standards demand generation mass production and distribution channels selection and training of retailers financing education of users cook stove servicing and evaluation the roles of the stakeholders must be specified and clarified perhaps as suggested earlier so that they can successfully work together to achieve these key elements of success in order to penetrate the rural markets as much as possible opportunities for collaboration to take advantage of existing dissemination networks should be explored with these factors taken into consideration a new improved chulha initiative can be

launching a new initiative on biomass cookstoves with the primary aim of enhancing the availability of clean and efficient energy for the energy deficient and poorer sections of our society large section of our population of the rural households and of the urban households according to the national sample st survey still uses biomass for its cooking needs an estimated of the residential energy in india comes from biomass much of it burnt in traditional chulhas the adverse health and implications of this form of energy supply are enormous with women and children at particular risk the burden of biomass fuel collection and processing for cooking also falls mainly upon women and children mainly girls who spend significant time gathering fuel resources every day providing a clean cooking energy option for these households will yield enormous gains in terms of health and welfare of the weakest and the most vulnerable sections of society at the same time the cleaner combustion in these devices will greatly reduce the products of incomplete combustion which are greenhouse pollutants thus helping combat climate change initiative of mnre is envisaged to be structured differently from the earlier national programme on improved chulhas although it will build on the several successes of that programme while also drawing lessons from the experience gained from its starting point of the current exercise is the user the solution on offer should first and foremost be easy to use and maintain and conform to local cooking habits across the country its adoption must make economic sense to the household the programme is conceived not as a handout to poorer households but rather as an economically sustainable business solution as the prime minister of india has often said we need to make the poor of this country new initiative is also based on the recognition that that cookstoves technology has improved considerably in the past few years but further advances are still possible and indeed essential our aim is to achieve quality of energy services from cookstoves comparable to that from other clean energy sources such as lpg has held several brainstorming sessions and consultations over the past few months with a range of stakeholders and experts from civil society academia business and government to develop an understanding of current activities and future potential of such a programme the prime office has been closely associated with these deliberations this initiative a series of projects are envisaged using several existing and better cookstoves and different grades of processed biomass fuels this will help in exploring a range of technology deployment biomass processing and delivery models leveraging partnerships the same time it will set in motion a series of activities that are designed to develop the of household cookstoves technologies and deployment models this may include an innovative global contest to develop combustion units with high thermal efficiency and low pollution characteristics and in parallel appropriate devices the initiative will aim for a significant enhancement of technical capacity in the country by setting up testing certification and monitoring facilities and strengthening programmes in key technical institutions an independent monitoring and evaluation component is envisaged to assess the activities and them on an ongoing basis and last but not the least it will welcome and promote participation by civil society and private actors to make it a true also believes that the technologies and delivery models that will be developed through this initiative will be useful for other developing countries in asia africa and latin america whose populations also suffer from health and other problems related to biomass use in household cooking therefore success of this initiative could well have a transformative impact not only for our own citizens but also for the energy poor in other developing

get importance at product development stage though these aspects are often critical in determining user acceptance to new stove design however the target of the scientific community must be to make a product which is not only technically superior multi feed stock compatible high combustion low emission model cook stove but a stove which is voluntarily accepted by community past experiences suggest that if this approach is not adhered to the community will shun a product ultimately as the goal is replacement of polluting low energy efficient cooking technologies which are not possible if the users reject technologically better the approach given below will help if identifying the most suitable cook stove as close to ideal as possible and provide inputs for further is a saying that after every km there is change in food and fuel pattern in india hence for such a diverse country it is imperative that rather than rolling out a uniform product cook stove customization is carried out prior to large scale adoption and diffusion efforts for strategic reasons it is proposed that a block is chosen as the smallest unit for dissemination planning and execution for each block the major social groups need to be identified care should be taken to ensure that minority groups are not left out of considerations then to promote fair competition all manufacturers are asked to come out with a product which they think will be best suited for the population residing in the block these products must already be certified by designated agencies after laboratory testing to have minimum efficiency and emission parameters as decided by the government once these products are submitted for field trial one reputed agency can be asked to conduct field trials for these stoves in a circular basis as each selected household will be provided all the product prototypes in a rotating fashion we avoid any bias in the study user feedback will be measured in a quantitative manner for a scientifically valid and neutral comparison amongst various models us define cook stove utility mathematically from the point of all the aspects detailed below the user will be requested to respond in the following manner point for each response is also better compared to traditional stove compared to traditional stove difference compared to traditional stove compared to traditional stove worse compared to traditional stove performance aspects which historically have been critical from point of view are not necessarily in same order of of of to cook local in taste of maintenance service and repair of smoke and during baseline survey additional performance aspect is highlighted by community the same can be added in the above list need to categorize the performance aspects into three categories namely critical very important and important if any stove gets in any critical aspect or two in any critical aspect from majority of users then the stove is rejected after field trials similarly during field trial phase it is important to identify user priorities and focus on dissemination of stoves which surpass the minimum performance expectation of users how to establish a fair quantitative cut off bench mark is a research question which needs further deliberations for the time being that there is no addition or reduction in the list of performance aspects mentioned above the maximum utility of a stove let us call it as the ideal stove can be however the general trend of production is that a product with overall higher utility is available at higher price this gives rise to an argument that better the product lesser will be its penetration amongst the after user feedback based field trial the most preferred cookstove with best user rating would be selected and disseminated the of that cook stove will be provided with the negative attributes as pointed out by the user community and will be asked to further customize if necessary once the customized model is ready government should come forward and provide targeted subsidy to make it available for the entire population of the block after all as suggested by the planning commission of india it is the solemn responsibility to provide affordable lifeline clean energy to the poorest of the poor s rural technology formerly rrl of technical unit for npic to was an important national programme under point programme of govt of india many scientific players have contributed a vast knowledge developments during to under npic as per needs of common people of rural india the ics were developed and it was successful even among poorest of poor thermal engineering was well considered in design developments of previous ics to obtain conservation of green fuels and reduction of pollutions most important aspects of last programme of fuels available its successful use in ics to get desired acceptability of ics by the users for long term cost durable understanding of ics by the of ics through out of the my view the present interested scientific players should review the past scientific works on development of india before commenting for any new some presentations suggestions made by premier institutions in last meeting were just repeating old theories of improved chulha programme however those were important for success of any national energy programme my suggestions are given for new new designs can be successful sustainable in indian scenario when it will be tested in field in different conditions for a considerable period all old models have been well tested at least for a decade therefore all existing successful designs should be scientifically reviewed by impartial scientific team and drawback if any should be eliminated it should be further developed if design with different concepts for indian requirement may be developed by dedicated development for evaluation of performance and emission of improved were well developed earlier which were equal to european standards however it can be modified if necessary as per processing its cost and was well tested during npic that those ics require for processing of fuels for combustion were miserably failed during propagation since indian rural users never accept the conditions to size the wood pieces in to mm diameter and mm length villagers will not pay any extra amount for sizing the fuels unless fuels are not available in their vicinity for daily cooking of of small sized fuels after sizing may cost more it can be applicable in area of improved chulhas and financing was well known during npic that use of ics was reduced drastically in villages when govt subsidy was withdrawn and cost ics was of should be affordable may be within to to obtain sustainability among all class of society in rural sector it should be noted that many middle class rural users even in interior part of north east have shifted from woody biomass to lpg gas for clean burning availability etc most of poor rural people and people having enough free fuels can go for wood burning for cooking now a incentives monitoring and the quality and evaluation of ics was failed during last part of npic due to its vast area of operation in the country the improved stoves should be foolproof models made centrally by few designated industries and durable then quality can be to users will certainly help adoption of in rural would like to work in the area of and standardisation of improved cook stoves at shyam envoy prime think we need to focus our efforts in the working groups on the following or elements to avoid repeating disappointments of the the technology side there are two components to design the most efficient sturdy and durable easy to use and safe combustion device to develop the most efficient and processing for a variety of available the more versatile the better the groups should come out very specific and precise benchmarks for both these technology objectives these include technical as well as economic in terms of need to have people focus also on product design once the basic technology is available how do we design a product around it to suit different user requirements and market conditions this is important in a country as diverse as india it will apply to the combustion device as well as to fuel processing eg whether in form of briquettes or pellets or compacted meeting the requirement of easy storage convenient use and final disposal of will need to start talking about an effective business plan to launch and sustain the product there may be need for focused awareness campaigns in different languages there will have to be demonstration campaigns and targeted advertising the plan may require product trials in the field and include study of feedback and possible adjustments in product design we could request assistance from our iims or the isb i can talk to until the initiative reaches the stage of growth we would need a monitoring and evaluation process under the have seen the earlier guidelines and benchmarks you had sent in the light of the results of the work of the groups these will have to be revised and this is very important we must ensure quality this time round as i said at our meeting we need high and sophisticated technology here not low or intermediate a k and of renewable energy of technology and pratap university of agriculture rajasthan reference to your letter regarding the above mentioned subject this is to kindly inform you that the bdtc udaipur has been working for the popularization of improved cookstove technology since a long time we have been working in the field of design development improvement testing installation and dissemination of technology of improved cookstove since a long time i would like to be involved in the following areas d and technology processing its cost and other relevant field if of renewable energy sources college of technology and engineering is actively engaged in teaching research development activities related to new and renewable energy sources viz bioenergy biogas and biomass and improved cookstoves the activities of renewable energy sources in the centre were initiated in april with sponsored project on utilization of renewable energy in agriculture technical back support unit on improved chulha was added in in the department the centre attained national recognition in the field of improved chulha and bio energy d and technology new models of chulha sukhad rajavikas heena aravali and single pot udai mohini developed at the centre received appreciation and commendation at various levels department has also developed a metallic sigri namely for domestic cooking need this sigri can accommodate small wooden twigs briquetted fuel and small pellets for meeting cooking energy requirement for an average sized family the thermal efficiency of this cookstoves is with briquetted fuel durable cookstoves chetak and udairaj were developed and installed at number of support unit organized many training programmes for rural women in rajasthan and other states the rural artisans are trained in construction and maintenance of chulha they are paid rs for each chulha constructed thus this becomes a self employment opportunity for the rural pot udairaj pot chetak monitoring and feed back of chulha is a regular feature of the centre so far more than feedback have been conducted in rajasthan mp maharashtra and andhra pradesh this helps in qualitative and quantitative control on the working of chulhas large size community chulhas have been constructed in institutions hostels and industries such as sadhana chemicals madri and manaria dairy farm udaipur downdraft gasifier stove which was designed in department consists of reactor grate ash removal primary air controller flap pot support and secondary air opening the capacity of the stove was kw and thermal efficiency was was noticed that improved cookstoves based on semi gasifier principle have better thermal efficiency and less emission improved cookstoves have been tested and their thermal efficiency and emissions were determined on the basis of water boiling and evaporation test chapati baking test as developed by the ministry recently two improved cookstoves namely navagni and philips biomass cookstoves were tested it was felt that testing standards for the performance evaluation of improved cookstoves should be developed considering the recent development carried out in the processing its cost and department has developed a densification machine yielding briquettes of required size according to need the densified material can be converted into cubes and pallets hard operated cycle operated and electric power operated briquetting machine of varying capacity running on principle of extruder has been designed and developed this machine has been tested for binding loose biomass and char powder observed that charcoal mixed with dung slurry in equal quantity given maximum efficiency of where as briquetting efficiency of charcoal plus clay mixture found to be a package of practice for proper utilization of prosopis juliflora coupled with charcoaling and briquetting process has been developed metallic kiln equipped with required provision for process of charcoaling and sufficient for kg of prosopis juliflora has been designed and developed it consists of two interlocking cylindrical and conical cover the cover is provided with the equally spaced steam release ports which can be closed with plugs when required the kiln is m in dia and m high and has a capacity of approximately cum the efficiency of developed kiln was observed as is a good scope of the densified fuels in the cooking stoves and different loose biomass waste materials can be utilized in place of fire wood improved methods for char production can be other relevant field if deptt has developed germplasm for fuel wood tree species of semi arid region of aravalli in the rajasthan and various agro technologies for improvement of hydrocarbon rich plant species for arid semi arid regions of rajasthan package of practice was developed for utilization of barren land for energy use through energy plantation programme research work on new species of energy plantation can be carried for the better production of fire and training may also be organized covering present state of art recent advances and future prospectus of different renewable energy for the identification of improved chulhas for the states of bihar jharkhand orissa chhatisgarh and uttar dr karabi understand that chulhas need to be identified for the above mentioned states from volume december but since i am not familiar with these stoves i am not in a position to offer these stoves were designed and developed under the npic program they have been tested in the simulated kitchen or laboratory for the ratio of the whole mixture of the combustion particulate matter spm value of efficiency of stove using the bis time with lid on surface suggestion would be to test the selected stoves further respirable particulate matter and carbon monoxide co emissions from stoves in the kitchen and adjoining rooms over a period of hours to understand the actual emission characteristics of the stove under actual field conditions this test may be conducted in number of representative households where this stoves will be introduced being the statistically calculated value from the total number of households where the stoves will be introduced water boiling test with litre water using the uc berkeley method for stove performance at high power both under cold start conditions and hot start low power simmer conditions and find out to boil without fuel specific down these above mentioned tests may be conducted both in the field and also in the simulated kitchen to understand the effect of these stoves on the indoor air quality iaq of the households and stove performance under field conditions when local fuels are used till a national standard for indoor air quality is finalised a comparative before and after study for the status of the iaq and stove performance parameters with traditional and improved stove is important to understand the improvement tests along with tests for stove safety stability surface temperature etc and day home placement test will provide good information about the acceptability and suitability of these stoves for the target households innovation contest for ambuj institute of technology recent years there has been much attention paid to the idea of as a way to induce the development of technology in neglected areas specifically this refers to grand to stimulate or technology prizes should be viewed as a potential complement to and not a substitute for traditional funding for research and innovation activities inducement prizes do offer several advantages including a broader spectrum of ideas and participants by reducing the barriers to a goal to be achieved without having to decide which is best way to meet that much of the risk to the participants since the award of the prize is contingent of the contest parameters being met capacity of prizes for educating inspiring and even mobilizing the additional resources from firms and other order to be successful though it is important to design the context carefully both in terms of defining the parameters of participation and the goal to be achieved furthermore if the ultimate aim is to commercialize the technology then some thought must also be given to the buyer commitment of market creating strategy global innovation challenge for cookstoves will be very useful in that it will stimulate technical experts worldwide to focus on what so far has been only a niche activity for this community by entraining new technology developers into this arena we hopefully should be able to achieve a quantum jump in performance as well as increased competition but in order to do so we need to design the challenge key questions that will need to be examined are the desirable minimum but achievable technical performance characteristics of the of cookstoves ie power thermal efficiency emissions is are a suitable cost are other key characteristics such as should we segment the customer base ie what is the minimum number of technologies that would allow for a reasonable coverage of the target technologies also be part of the the challenge be a prize ie first past the post or a contest with minimum performance is a reasonable time frame for the contest as short as possible but long enough to allow technology developers to experiment with new on these aspects will be developed through consultations with various experts from within and outside the country including if needed a workshop in october which brings together these experts for finalizing these veena would like to emphasize that this opportunity comes in times where communication is much easier than in the s when the first initiative on cooking stoves was launched we are in a new era and hence the ideas and the methods should reflect this newness while developing options to replace an age old practice ie cooking with part global innovation the challenge customer base should be defined on the basis of food habits of an zone this could also be a parameter for the contestants to define the applicability of their stove subsequently this can be a criterion for selecting the my view a contest will promote more ideas to the months time frame from the entry into contest to final selection of the product designs seems technical include cooking practices as a th topic in the proposed ws on different technical delivery of sdc projects is to market irrigation systems for small and marginal farmers i would suggest that this project experience would be useful to look into while designing deployment strategies for new cooker rural network could also give us useful svati thought that i should put across my experiences in interacting with household stove users over the past two and a half decades in bullet points may provide some insights into what i have experienced as the thought process of the rural woman i have often asked women what they were looking for in an improved stove their preferences in order of priority in the regions where i visited limited fuel stress communicated as eye irritation and respiratory problems largely for the children around this preference was i think of relatively recent origin considering the awareness about harmful effects of smoke as a result of the npic cooking time vessels soot free operation more an issue in the case of portable stoves because they fear that the stove may topple while in vigorous they should not have to change their cooking habits or this has implication on the height of the stove some women showed me bruised wrists because of the stove height and the process of roti seemed to prefer a fixed stove over a portable stove in the kitchen they may be okay with a portable stove as the second stove in the same way as lpg stoves are used mud stoves were preferred women were open to cement stoves while mud stoves contributed to the grace and charm of the kitchen cement stoves were relatively maintenance free of course these women were not exposed to the conveniences of emerging stoves trend seems to be to shift to agro residues wherever and whenever possible largely to reduce the time spent in collecting fuel there also seems to be an evolving tradition among agricultural labour that the labour is allowed to take away the agro residue from the farms and plantations where they work it is not uncommon to see different types of fuel stacked outside a house and in the cattle shed so when women said they wanted a multi fuel stove they would mean stoves that can burn husk saw dust wood coconut waste etc is always a conflict within the family about smoke in the kitchen men preferred it to a limited extent because it kept their produce stored above the kitchen dry women who had suffered long years of smoke were very clear that they and more importantly their children should not be exposed to smoke is the preferred fuel but it is sparingly used always because of the high cost of fuel and very poor penetration of distribution network an lpg cylinder usually lasts for months and often the household has to take the cylinder to an exchange point as there is still a problem with the last mile connectivity is not preferred because of the problems in supply and more importantly the quality of the stove kerosene stoves are often in very poor shape and food cooked on bad kerosene stoves smells of kerosene which is a repulsive smell the aroma of a smoky wood fire is more acceptable there are peak seasons when stoves are sold from january to may is the best time for selling stoves stoves costing around rs would be very difficult to sell largely because the amount is too small for a stove loan from the shg and too high for a personal investment stoves costing rs may sell to a limited market only if the stove is an inspirational product looks and behaves like an lpg stove even then women would be embarrassed to tell their friends and neighbours that they paid such a high amount for a wood stove whereas it would be okay to pay the same cost for an lpg stove so issue of positioning of fuel efficient household stoves need to be addressed most households would be wary of the new single pan portable stoves of high efficiency that are invading the commercial market women would take some time to totally shift to a new stove by dismantling the conventional stove stoves that have components that need to be replaced would also not arouse consumer confidence stove dissemination programme would take off well in regions where time is valued a household would be more inclined to invest in a time saving stove when the women are engaged in say beedi rolling is commonly believed that an unsubsidized stove programme would not take off because men control the finances and the stove is a need but women from several regions in the south have informally told us that they can influence their husbands and family members but it takes time so stoves should be available for sale over long periods and not for a week in a village fair or some such session on improved chulhas some sangeeta of mechanical engineering iit the outset i would like to thank the mnre and all others for taking this initiative and giving us an opportunity to participate in the discussion on march i would like to offer my comments on the proceedings of that meeting i would like to put my comments in two categories technology and technology good who has been associated with design analysis of a chulha would agree that design of a chulha is not an easy task technically a chulha should have high efficiency and low emissions with the fuel available in the region long life and low maintenance requirements but at the same time it must also satisfy some other requirements like ease of operation compatibility with food habits and affordability by the target group to incorporate all in a single design is indeed a tall order in chulha design of a good chulha particularly becomes difficult many other modern products because there any methodologies in place for design of a chulha much of the designing is done in a hit and trial mode in view of some of us who have been involved in analysis of chulhas for some time this is largely due to lack of good technical inputs in the development of this technology if we want to design a heat exchanger we have a wide range of correlations available which are a result of high quality experimental and analytical research even an industrial burner using a gaseous fuel can be designed using empirical correlations however the chulha as a technical device has still not reached that level is because of this difficulty that npic saw a very wide range of designs most of them without a sound technical research backing with the immense pressure on the tbus to meet the targets only a cut and trial approach could be used with limited understanding of the complex coupling of the phenomena taking place in the chulha for range of the current scenario the emphasis on clean combustion the visions of some researchers and developments in the gasification technology have brought forth a variety of very promising stove designs thanks to these developments the biomass based cooking is getting a completely fresh outlook however it must be understood that in a country like india a single type of chulha cannot be the choice for everyone using biomass for cooking the currently available notwithstanding there is still a need for doing the required for bringing out with good technical performance which the user can choose from to suit her needs and her pocket also a single chulha may not give high performance in all applications like roti making simmering of milk etc moreover at times it may be important for the designer to compromise somewhat on the performance to provide a low cost and durable option to the user there is a need for a range of products which can meet the needs of different economic strata of the society as well as different geographical regions it is suggested that at least some groups involved in chulha come together share their strengths and come up with generic design methodologies and consequently several designs of improved chulhas which can meet the desired standards chulhas and private the view of some of us any intervention in the rural areas to improve their living standard must not be seen in isolation from their most fundamental need of income generation for majority of the rural populace the living standards are abysmally low primarily because they have the required source of income thus any intervention must be first seen as an opportunity of providing local employment through development of local entrepreneurs it is easy to see that improved chulha technology has a very good potential to contribute to the same think it has been rightly identified that a marked improvement in chulha performance is possible only with processed fuel broadly speaking there will be two kinds of fuel of woody fuel into smaller and pelletizing of loose of these can easily be carried out by local entrepreneurs small cutters as well as with small motors are available for chopping of long woody fuel into smaller pieces at the meeting in mnre it was mentioned by the bp representative that the pellets prepared by bp require a machine with a large capacity motor and hence this process is not suitable for decentralized operation this does not seem to hold enough ground there are smaller machines available in iit delhi a machine with hp motor is due to be installed for making pellets to feed the gasifier similar machines can be used by a local entrepreneur for providing the processed fuel for depending upon the designs it may be possible for at least some of the improved chulhas to be at the local level without compromising on the critical dimensions this will have to be worked out for individual argument of economies of scale must be seen against the backdrop of need for employment generation in the villages rather than making the villagers do labour work provided by the government under the nrega an initiative to develop local entrepreneurs in the activities relevant to the rural populace would be much more is important to keep this in view particularly in a scenario where multinationals would want to capture the huge market of rural areas and not let the local entrepreneurs develop independent of them after the controversial role of multinationals in indian agriculture the emphasis needs to be on empowering the user to meet their energy needs on their own terms if the knowledge base in chulha design rests with only private parties the information is not likely to become open source we need to work towards a situation where this knowledge base is available to anyone who would look for it and already mentioned for a technology like a chulha there have to be different levels of standards some compromise on the performance can bring the cost substantially down hence the certification of chulhas can grade the chulha designs in consonance with their performance with a certain minimum level of performance for is important for mnre to set up labs in different zones of the country for testing and certification of chulhas i would like to state that mnre should be more open and invite all people to participate in the effort rather than identifying narrow groups as tbus in the past which have the monopoly of getting funding from the mnre anyone not belonging to these tbus was never given any funding irrespective of their interest in contributing to the would like to summarize the above points as for to develop the methodologies for chulha design as well as for developing a variety of new designs with high performance catering to a wide range of needs a few groups need to come together to give technical inputs as well those related to field to develop technical information on chulha design which can be accessible to everyone rather than depend primarily on the patented designs by private parties for local entrepreneurship at various levels fuel supply chulha maintenance etc caution needs to be exercised in letting multinationals play a major role in the program since their intent to capture the market may hamper the long term interests of the local community for different levels of standards with a minimum level of performance required for iit delhi three of us in the mechanical engineering department prof mr ravi prof anjan ray and i have been involved in analysis of some stoves in the past decade or so besides prof rajendra prasad from centre for rural development and technology was associated with npic earlier and has developed certain stove designs we can formulate proposals for further work as part of this initiative for now i would like to say on behalf that we would like to be a part of primarily the group with participation in the group on standardization as desirable delivery model for large scale dissemination of improved hafeezur rehman teri new experience suggests some bottlenecks in large scale deployments of cook stoves review of various cook stove related deployment initiatives at local or regional level suggests women are main users of technology promotion dissemination or deployment of improved cook stoves needs to be targeted towards women this requires a marketing and delivery strategy that keeps women at the centre of the dissemination process and related stakeholders have limited capacities for taking the dissemination and deployment process forward in this context the understanding of rural market chains and the possibility of on some of them needs to be rural households express interest to purchase cookstoves but may not be in a position to pay upfront hence financial incentives need to be worked out in a manner that benefits end users while ensuring development of a sustainable market value the shelf availability of quality products at the local level needs to be ensured this would require development of a value chain also for select technologies capacity needs to be developed at local level to ensure decentralized modification of these technologies to cater to local needs sales service and repair is necessary for sustaining adoption of new cooking technology if proper repair maintenance and replacement of spares is not in place then users often revert back to the traditional stoves therefore it is desirable that decentralized repair and maintenance facilities are available close to the end users on the above mentioned points it is desirable that a strategy is formulated for a robust delivery mechanism before actual implementation of a national level programme to avoid repeating the identified from past experience some of the key action points in this regard have been indicated consultations with manufacturers ngos and government entities who been associated with cookstove related dissemination of groups for taking forward different components of the action lacs conferences regional national participants each return airfare lunch of existing best practices and successful dissemination models for improved cook stoves through review of secondary literature eg from npic models of arti and derive learning related to delivery mechanisms what works and what does not work under various specific gaps in market value chain development for large scale deployment of on identified gaps at policy market and capacity levels for large scale deployment of cook stoves capacity building needs for development of an end user friendly market chain for large scale deployment of cookstoves state level nodal training centre for imparting technical business management and personality development skills for various stakeholders like rural entrepreneurs responsible for sales and after sales and compare approaches for centralized and decentralized deployment of cook stove technology including business models optimal supply chain management strategy clearly identifying strategy for both macro level centralized manufacturing and decentralized local level entrepreneurship lacs need for field based trials to compare and test of desirable financial support mechanisms through literature review consultation with manufacturers financial institutions and end options for financial incentive and support such as cdm to companies for research and facilitate economy of scale production users to ensure wider penetration of improved cooking specific policy regulatory and financing related recommendations for evolving a robust delivery process for large scale specific policy recommendations and financing schemes like specific role of manufacturers government agencies entrepreneurs and civil society bs dutta energy india private qpre energy india private limited are interested to be involved in all the below groups if d and technology processing its cost and of improved chullas and incentives monitoring and is a few our initial ideas that need to be considered note that we would provide additional feedback as we get d and technology quality and newer technology incentives financial and tax breaks for support and subsidy for patenting technologies especially outside india to protect the intellectual indoor air technology transfer and provide tax standard does not fit all each technology warrants different design and operational modes so the standards to evaluate to be created to evaluate at par testing conditions should be considered for example stoves which take less fuel is designed to take multiple refuel but stove which are design to take more fuel need not have many refuels the standards cannot test the stove which does not need refuels the same way by putting less fuel and keep refuelling remember that refuelling does cause additional smoke particular matter especially in gasification when the stove is designed for less refuelling a common standard will give the impression that the stove did not meet standards where in reality it has met the standards and in fact better performs and post training should be considered as part of setting moderately efficient design capable of offering sustained performance under field conditions will be more desirable than an extremely efficient design which is very sensitive to operational in to consider practical usage of the stove and not set the standard that does not serve any practical usage processing its cost and to consider various fuel used and food habits for our fuel wood to promote deforestation should be should be able to work with any kind of fuel is a failed strategy strategy should be to let the use the available biomass in the geographical region cost of supplying fuel is very expensive and subsidizing that will lead to costly maintenance of the stove of improved chulhas and is a very sensitive issue with the end user price of the stove cannot be the only consideration it has been proven that the quality and the practical usage of the stove is what will make this a success and not only the cost of stove should be provided and in fairness the subsidy should be based on average costing percentage of the selling price subsidy cannot favour one manufacturer or the other for example providing a fixed subsidy of say rs will favour a manufacturer which mrp is rs and will hurt the dissemination of a stove whose mrp is rs finance should be considered to make this program a quick incentives monitoring and taxes vat cst should be manufacturers who require capital funds to expand and provide healthy competition should be helped by the central government though the product can be competitive some manufacturers who have large backing of funds can over run the competition not by the quality of the stove but by the sheer length of time that they can sustain without any help from external manufacturers should be provided with some percent of advance money for the purchase orders to better facilitate cash flow be implemented in a decentralized demonstration of chulhas should be the considered so that end user should feels that the change is for the betterment over old traditional to have good number of workshops exhibitions at panchayat levels to bring in awareness about improves stoves benefits benefits like increase in leisure time for womenfolk to actively participate in family and community the burden on the government health care programs should be the back bone for this success of the program as that of the implementing agency will certainly lie in making a choice of right model for each location the chulhas should not only be efficient but it should also be rugged and offer persistent good performance for a range of fuel and a range of improved chulha saves nothing nor provides any benefits if it is not used similarly if it is not used in large numbers then the impact will be lass significant therefore the purpose of dissemination must be to share and distribute the implementation monitoring need is to show the quantity of different household fuels required to meet the lifeline consumption of fuel for cooking in targeted srinivasan joint adviser

storming consultation on improved biomass on th march it was indeed a privilege and pleasure to be part of the thought process to revive improved cook stove programme that has the power to lighten the lives and mitigate the drudgery of women over burdened with household chores of which the most cumbersome and hazardous yet unavoidable being the cooking fuel cycle at the side apart from this the cook stove programme assumes paramount significance in view of the contribution it can make to sustainable development agenda energy and climate change issues from rural areas and from households with relatively lesser means though not necessarily from the bpl section of the society are hard hit by continued use of traditional chulhas and fuel wood scarcity compounded by pollutant emissions from traditional stoves in such a scenario the value of improved with and without chimney cannot be under estimated and under stated was to the chagrin of the millions of women burning biomass in their kitchens using crude locally handmade chulhas that the improved chulha programme npic came to a standstill in those women who adopted improved chulhas in gujarat state were willing to incur the cost of getting replacements for worn out chulhas and those who were not covered under the scheme were willing to pay for its cost to own the same realization of the benefits of improved chulhas to conserve fuel wood to ensure a clean smoke free cooking area to make cooking a pleasant activity and to ensure a positive impact on health had dawned on the women cooks and their families the user women were handicapped to get replacements of parts or the chulha in totality as per specifications to reinstall or remake thermally efficient chulhas that have worn out for want of local technically qualified persons and due to non availability of replacements in the local market and lack of government impetus those with some imagination either made replicas of the model on their own or repaired them many a time altering the dimension specifications unintentionally thereby affecting thermal efficiency of the stove to a negligible extent to render their kitchens smoke and soot free and also to reap other benefits associated with it adopters as well as its potential users in gujarat state had begun to reveal confidence in the technology and in the government programme as a result of the hard work of the staff of tbsu baroda and the strong support it received from govt of gujarat and govt of india through the then mnes and the multi model multi design multi agency approach that was followed in implementation of npic at grass root level then the commitment of the many ngos and district development officers and their staff due to the continuous follow up by tbsu baroda too contributed to the success of npic in gujarat there was demand for improved chulhas in the state of gujarat where the undersigned was looking after the technical back up support unit under npic since till it was at such a time that the programme came to a standstill is very heartening to note that the govt of india mnre is envisaging revival of improved chulha programme improved cookstoves programme is a complex technology transfer programme as it covers a multitude of population with diverse cooking practices food habits and taboos and beliefs centring on the stove or the fire place for meal preparation also another important ground reality is that in many kitchens in the rural semi urban and urban areas meals have been and are cooked and served on zero cost chulhas using free fuels of the stove programme also entails rebuilding the confidence in the end users in particular and the people in general regarding a massive initiative like npic forward for immediate future time tested improved designs and models for immediate programme of revival of improved chulhas say npic should start without losing time with existing time tested thermally efficient designs of improved chulhas with and without chimney with remarkably low emission characteristics ie well within the standards ear marked or set such existing models range from to or so depending on its model design features and material plus cost of chimney wherever applicable for about six to eight months the programme may include improved in local mixture however this should be a stop gap arrangement until mass production in iron materials is in place the time frame for the same shall not exceed six to eight months efforts ought to be made to revive and those who were identified and trained and those who collaborated under npic to manufacture prototype design simultaneously improved stove programme with stoves in mixture made in situ should be weaned out ie within six to eight months or earlier as soon as a few manufacturers of iron stoves are established this effort would help to recapture the time confidence and demand lost over the years since chulhas are available for use of mixed bag of biomass and with power ratings of more than adequate to meet domestic cooking needs stoves for dry dung cake and large capacity cooking have grating as an additional feature models in durable and robust material include those in cast iron or those with cast iron liners cast iron liners could well be within to in the case of two pot models at the present less durable models than those with cast iron liners are those with pottery or ceramic liners cost could be or or so respectively with a life of three to five years or more depending on the care in use and handling in transportation is a factor to be taken into consideration while fixing cost or for free replacements under terms and conditions of order or purchase the cost of cast iron liners is not prohibitive its life years and if used properly a life of the stove cost is an important criterion to consider for passed the quenching test at that time it was priced at rs however it could not reach the commercial level due to reasons beyond the control of tbu baroda samples of cast iron lined chulhas are in use over seven years without any complaints in select immediate promotional efforts should focus on reviving already available durable models like or closed models with i cast iron liners or ii ceramic liners or iii pottery liners iv cast iron chimneyless stoves priyagni with some modification to use fuel as is in normal use without the necessity of chopping them to very short and thin pieces mention some of the field tested most popular models photographs enclosed as a separate file for ready reference in gujarat and that are appropriate to be promoted elsewhere as well are chulha the most popular two pot versatile chulha for a household size ranging from to or a little more members thermal efficiency of in field and to with a wide range of materials like mud with cement plastered finish mortar with cement plastered finish pottery liners in brick masonry and cast iron liners in brick masonry and the last gave the best thermal performance in lab in kitchen performance test the improved chulha mamta chulha the most popular model in gujarat state revealed less consumption on an average as compared to the traditional chulha with a sample size of families for each type of chulha the range being to the reduction in emissions due to improved chulha was observed to be and in reference to co nox and tsp as compared to the traditional shielded chulha in laboratory tests as well as in the field ratio was and in the lab and the field household tests respectively mamta a fixed model gave a little better performance than priyagni model a portable metal chulha in emission characteristics the air samples were collected at the breathing zone of a cook squatted on the floor cm away from the stove the fact that the improved chulhas like mamta chulha and portable metal chulha are far more superior to traditional chulha studied by tbsu baroda is reported in air pollution energy and health for the issue no december a publication of esmap the world chulha two pot versatile chulha for a large household of to members or a little more thermal efficiency of in thermal efficiency of to and sumamta chulha thermal efficiency of to single pot designs with chimney note use of grating improves thermal efficiency i one pot closed design and ii with grating two pot closed design for dung cake and logs of fuel wood improved chulhas without chimney in one and two pot stoves were also designed and developed in mud and field tested for one pot stove and to for two pot stove in mud and in liners the performance of stove acceptability was cent per cent these are low cost or zero material cost chulhas if made in local mixture and pottery ceramic cost rs to per unit of one and two pot shielded chulhas respectively chimney cast is an additional cost to this from the above models portable metal stove priyagni stove has also been promoted in gujarat state chulhas under i to vi above have been tested successfully in the field over many years with some adaptation as to the orientation of stove opening where required in the states of gujarat kerala and uttaranchal pottery and ceramic liners and cast iron liners of such stoves to be laid in mortar body in situ with ceramic tiles refractory tiles on top apart from cement concrete chulhas have also been developed and tested in the lab and field successfully by tbu baroda these are versatile designs appropriate for cooking across a cross section of users with differing economic background household size cooking needs meal practices and cooking habits to say that there may be other models too that can be promoted in other states along with these models in extreme cold regions shielded chulhas will be appropriate other than those closed ones with water jacket for heating water utilizing waste heat from flue gas the existing models and designs of improved stoves may be assessed to short list the better of the same with representations from each variant design and model for implementation under the national programme the feedback on performance lab and field test reports thermal and emission from designer or tbsu the establishment of ceramic unit and prototype design development of cast iron models etc can be some of the criteria to shortlist the same as these can speed up the process combustion chamber of these models and designs can be further improved to obtain higher efficiency and lower emission values however it should be borne in mind that it would work out cheaper and more advantageous in the context of cdm to compromise a little on the efficiency and design to make the improved versions that are more user appropriate simple to operate and reasonable in cost and workable and acceptable technology that will serve to achieve the global national local and end user goals agenda and development for new design future models of improved chulha should be cost effective affordable to average households should not burden unduly the exchequer should be versatile and user and environment friendly to accommodate variety of fuels natural and processed therefore my interest lies in all the five areas identified cooking needs cooking practices cooking methods and other requirements of the family easily maintainable by any one responsible for cooking and allied tasks with local availability of easily replaceable parts with excellent market tie ups for spare parts repair and maintenance and even replacements these stoves should also exhibit improved emission characteristics than the available new should be simple in details and should be such that the same can be developed in pottery or ceramic liners user and environment friendly design contest in new improved solid biomass burning attract the best design of combustion chamber and stove a contest may be organized though it may not be of much use the best design will be the one that satisfies i a minimum thermal efficiency value for fixed closed models and or so for portable models ii low pre decided emission values for pollutants that pose health hazard co tsp etc and iii a pre determined price range of rs to that is affordable to average households and with the least burden on the exchequer for those to whom a lifeline supply is envisaged like bpl families and other special categories such as srcitizens further the prototypes will be subjected to iv field tests to assess their comparative user acceptability and the best design will be identified on the basis of criteria i to iv as mentioned above under b and others as deemed appropriate if none of the entries meet the criteria set for the contest no design will be adjudged as the prize winning entry in case of any winning entry the design of the same may be purchased by goi for promotion in the new should be simple in details and should be such that the same can be developed in pottery or ceramic multi model multi design multi model multi design approach as earlier is required to revive and implement npic one single approach will not be adequate to meet the cooking requirements of the diverse population of india potential users of improved chulhas who burn solid biomass fuels range from i those under bpl who gather fuel free of cost to those who are affluent families with large or very large farms or plantations who either has free fuel supply from own lands or buy from the market who reside in rural urban or semi urban areas and those who use a multitude of solid biomass fuels like low dense leafy biomass coconut tree leaves or others to dry dung cakes to fuel wood of different qualities and densities and ii those who cook simple meals comprising of one item like rice or roti or composite meals like rice or any other cereal dhal mix as in khichdi or complex multi dish meals and iii those who use a variety of cooking methods boiling stewing steaming roasting broiling pan roasting or barbequing tandoori roti making baking brewing and so on and so forth and iv vessels of varied dimensions shapes flat and round bottomed and materials apart from this there are v rural households with cattle and livestock that will require a stove to cook animal feed too in addition to cooking family meals some will require vi a portable chulha while a large number will require fixed chulhas some may prefer vii a chulha with chimney while some may want to go for a chulha without chimney viii some may be small medium or large while some may be single member units and some may want a chulha to be transported to the fields for a long period of time irrespective of the diversity of requirements they all would like to smoke pollutant emissions and soot due to burning different forms of biomass fuels in the stove from kitchen or cooking area to the outside so that their tasks of cooking and maintenance of chulha and its premises remain a pleasant easy one on the field realities the following probably explains the approaches required for low end improved chulhas costing rs to on a sharing basis with differential levels of subsidy depending on the client traits like bpl category to ensure a life line supply of and fuel to name a few categories that need special consideration for lifeline supply are bpl families inclusive of sr citizens physically challenged cooks etc under this category pottery liners of thermally efficient shielded designs and mortar models of improved stoves to be included these liners may be fixed in situ in mixture or as per local traditional practice the already trained potters may need refresher training in the identified improved stoves with the best performance characteristics rs to rs and high end rs to rs improved fixed or portable chulhas closed or shielded type without and with differential levels of subsidy depending on the economic strata of the client and end use technology features and fuel type special fuel size and type like briquettes etc to ensure a life line supply of and fuel to name a few categories that need special consideration for lifeline supply are families sr citizens physically challenged cooks etc under this ceramic pottery and cast iron liners of improved chulha models and metal improved stoves closed or shielded type need to be promoted the fixed designs may be installed in situ using these stoves are more durable stoves as under a and b may be large or medium power rated chulhas with one or two pot facility as agency on the field requirements and the models chosen for dissemination in a location multi agency approach will be required to promote the technology in case of factory manufactured portable metal chulha and fuels or fixed chulhas with pottery ceramic cast iron liners and other parts like chimney cowl etc probably with a user manual manual appropriate distribution channel need to be in place in the case of low cost improved stoves in cement concrete or in pottery and to install liners iron of medium cost stoves in in situ local work force is an absolute necessity to trouble shoot and to attend to repair and maintenance the same work force as above can be equipped either of the cases as in b and c above the remuneration to the service personnel should come from the end user or technology adopter in improved burning stove technology and processed improved burning stove technology and processed fuels provide wide scope for impacting rural economy through entrepreneurship and distribution channels at the local level strategy should be in place to make easily available parts of improved chulha or the stove in totality all components in the local market for quick installation of the entire chulha and replacements of worn out parts this was observed to be a significant problem encountered by the local adopters of the said technology in villages a delay in availability can force the user to switch back to traditional open fire or shielded chulha as cooking task cannot be like improved chulhas processed fuels too need to be produced and marketed in a decentralized manner to encourage local entrepreneurship and easy marketing appropriate marketing and distribution channel such as entrepreneur dealer agent retailer chain pds as well as self employed local entrepreneurial work force shgs kudumbasrees or nrega or even artisans need to be developed and roped processing its cost and decentralized approach to promote local entrepreneurship individual or group as in shgs or kudumbasrees is necessary to make processed fuels available locally at relatively lower cost need for the same and also to impact upon local economy along with regional or sub regional centers for large scale production is necessary to ascertain the existing and potential market and existing status of technologies and self employed entrepreneurs in the field of precessed fuls for solid biomass burning stoves in the country strategy and unified client publicity need based location client and technology specific promotional strategy is an absolute requirement for effective percolation and adoption of improved chulhas in the field more or less unified promotional education modules need to be developed and adopted by all concerned to popularize the improved chulhas at the grass root level or at the end user multi pronged approach rather than fuel conservation and national need approach is required to make the technology penetrate into all the solid burning households this is so as the cost of fuel for cooking and stove are not a part of family expenditure moreover until efforts were directed towards the goal of making thermally efficient pollution free traditional cook stoves under npic no concerted scientific input had gone into it in india neither the women nor their family considers it important to switch over to improved chulhas to save fuel or its cost as it is a free fuel for them experience has shown that adequately demonstrated to users is a major motivating factor for them to adopt improved stove technology once the technology is accepted and adopted as an integral part in daily cooking all other benefits positive impact on climate change mitigation of black carbon clean cooking area etc will follow mention a few of the different approaches that need to be focused on in promotional modules are efficiency fuel conservation time and effort saving elimination or noticeable reduction in pollution within the standards permissible health impact on women children and elderly impact on climate change black carbon other tsp etc of modern technology and upward mobility in the fuel ladder to the extent of promotion from crude traditional stone or shielded low efficient chulhas to improved chulhas and also from crude biomass to processed biomass like briquettes to liquid gaseous opportunity cost in continued use of trc which would deprive them of income generating skill acquisition and generation of income thereof better care of children others and self and scope for income generation through the potential for entrepreneurship self employment individually or in groups as by self help groups etc in improved and improved fuel is important to take into consideration the mob psychology or the desire to keep up with the ie to go for a model like the neighbour has though not appropriate here proper assistance and education of the user family and the cook is of utmost importance to assist them to make the right appreciation related to traditional stove material modern materials should be borne in mind while considering stove for dissemination for example in kerala the traditional stoves have been and are still in pottery liners and so improved mud chulhas will not have much relevance except probably in hilly regions and tribal areas where even pottery liners will be appreciated by an average user whereas in other areas improved chulhas in cast iron liners laid in brick masonry with tiled preferably refractory tiled top surface would be appreciated and development labeling and name plate specifications need to be drawn for portable metal and fixed chulhas with cast iron liners of each of the specific improved designs a certain minimum performance level and emission characteristics ought to be in place for a design model to become eligible for consideration of certification improved stoves ought to be given green label one two or three green circles etc in consonance with its potential to reduce emissions environment friendly traits so as to enable the potential users to select the model health benefits and improved chulhas may be graded as grade i grade ii grade iii etc in accordance with its performance characteristics both thermal and emission with grade i and green circles denoting the best in both features respectively a stove may carry grade i ii or iii label with one two or three green circles as the case may be approved model and its parts thereof should carry name plate with all necessary details as deemed appropriate along with a card this would empower the users apart from enhancing the accountability of the who are willing to comply by the standard specifications for the production of the said cast iron liners or metal chulhas should be approved as per the provisions under the indian standards act to use standard mark isi assuring quality of the product may be provided to manufacturers who show readiness to make such cast iron liners or metal chulhas as per standard improved solid biomass burning stoves will have assured minimum thermal performance and low emission characteristics and will ensure minimal health hazards clean cooking and other benefits to end users apart from meeting national goals and international agenda on climate change of role in drawing up policy decisions and implementation strategies needs special emphasis has a significant role to play in the replacement of all mud chulhas from the field at all costs by improved stoves i with liners in pottery ceramic cast iron and ii metal stoves as early as possible as a measure to revolutionize cooking task this is a target that ought to be achieved in a stipulated time frame mnre has a pivotal role in setting up of new tbsus and revival of old tbsus and well equipped laboratories backup support units are needed to support the programme the role of experienced scientists to participate in the programme of revival of the improved chulha programme and to give leadership and direction in different states cannot be under stated the experienced leaders can be great assets not only to the revival scheme but also its management monitoring feedback and shall be the prerogative of government mnre in consultation with the tbsus and a few other stakeholders in the programme as deemed fit and necessary to draw up standard specifications as well as scheme for labelling and affixing name plates etc in appropriate designs and mnre should take up evaluation of existing designs and models of improved stoves through a select set of its new or old using experienced staff of tbsus as it is necessary to further short list the best of the stoves from different existing designs and models as appropriate for different households in different locations the existing status and potential for processed fuel market including technologies need to be assessed to measure the scope for furthering this as an area for decentralized entrepreneurial ventures equipped labs need to be set up in a decentralized manner especially with proven committed scientists in partnering institutes where tbsus may be these laboratories will undertake testing of chulhas to assess its performance characteristics both thermal and emission characteristics material design and development both women and men in individual capacity or in groups training and establishment of such entrepreneurs in metal cast iron or other liners and in strong durable robust metal portable improved cook stoves need to be taken up in a big on a war footing but organized decentralized manner to meet the local needs of the programme it is of utmost significance to promote local entrepreneurship in improved cook stove technology in the context of multinationals wanting to capture the indian biomass burning cook stove market a huge market of households and other establishments devouring the scope of establishment of local entrepreneurs who are capable of improving local economies through the manufacture of stoves to meet the differing needs of the diverse population and partnerships need to be supported adequately and appropriately by the government as an initiative to involve promising new scientific interests in design modification and development of new innovative user friendly concepts in improved chulha the programme periodically and assess the need for policy changes formulation of new policies etc to enhance the penetration and adoption of the programme to all end users within the shortest time in an efficient and effective of improved chulhas and cost of improved chulhas and financial aspects like cost should be chalked out in accordance with the design model and all factors of cost of production profit loss in transportation and so on and so forth along with fiscal incentives in order to encourage it with minimal burden on the exchequer and the families bpl to technical backup support units role of technical backup support units in a massive programme like improved programme where of indian households if not or more are to be covered cannot be under stated or undervalued tbsus need to be supported with adequate staff and finances for work training to build and strengthen capabilities get manufacturers of shielded and closed models established undertake tests as testing laboratories for standardization purpose as recognized by bis assess performance characteristics thermal and emission of improved biomass stoves for promotion in the monitor to follow up and get feedback from all stake holders especially from entrepreneurs manufacturers and everyone in the channel of distribution end users ngos and gos etc assist the government in all matters pertaining to the programme including policy directions to enhance effectiveness and efficiency of implementation of the programme and achieve the goals and any other task as deemed fit and needed is of utmost importance that the tbsus be headed by scientists with proven track record dedication and commitment to biomass fuel conservation mitigation of hardships and health hazards of women who are the main participants in cooking fuel cycle and have an understanding of the larger picture and relevance of the technology in the global and national scene cdm economic development etc incentives monitoring and feedback incentives like tax holidays and exemption of excise duty cost sharing subsidy to ensure life line supply of both the technology and fuel or loan and others as deemed fit and appropriate need to be in place to encourage and promote entry of entrepreneurs into the scheme and adoption of the technology by end users proper mechanism to publicize popularize and promote as well as encourage adoption at end user side to monitor to collect feedback and to evaluate field performance of the new programme and review of performance of all stakeholders has to be in place to ensure its of the improved cook stove programme and government mnre has a role to play in successfully sustaining the programme of improved cook stoves in the light of cdm at the global level and the well defined goals of conservation reduction in green house gases and tsp in the environment at the national level and mitigation of health hazards from burning solid biomass fuels in domestic cooking and mitigation of hardships of women in cooking fuel cycle and biomass burning households and entrepreneurship development in cook stoves at the local level the programme becomes sustainable through appropriate marketing service and promotional strategy and once the programme has reached a self sustainable stage the role of government will be one to exercise controls and on rural economy in specific and indian economy in of local decentralized entrepreneurship and workforce in the improved cook stove programme assumes great significance in view of the diversity of requirements of the diverse population of the country the spread of its population and the contribution it can make to semi urban rural tribal urban economy and per capita income of the people even in semi urban and urban households of many states of the country solid biomass burning stoves are in use either for part of the cooking tasks or in the social burden arising due to loss of man days and medical care expenditure incurred by the government on chronically ill persons with respiratory ailments due to exposure to pollutant emissions from traditional and poorly designed solid fuel burning stoves can be mitigated through thermally efficient non polluting with emissions well within the standards ear marked or set of view of my active involvement prior to npic in the assessment of rural domestic energy consumption and traditional cooking devices issues and development and later on as in charge of tbsu i have been actively involved in various aspects of improved cook stove technology development and dissemination under npic our designs and models are user appropriate since the starting point was the traditional chulha and an evolution of improved based on traditional chulha and user requirements i have successfully developed prototype models in cast iron apart from pottery and ceramic liners and established manufacturers in ceramic liners and conducted emission studies in the lab and field apart from thermal performance studies and kitchen performance tests in lab and field i have also undertaken various other tasks related to npic our contribution is well documented and acknowledged nationally and internationally therefore my interest lies in all the five areas from harish a part of the improvements in the process and as requested in the last meeting held on we hereby submit our recommendations which would make the whole initiative a grand success and take this initiative to a step which would stand as a bench for awareness generation as we are aware that indoor air pollution though is a major health concern and a global health hazard is quite not known to people users tg who are affected by it the one reason for this is the fact that there is no awareness pertaining to the ill effects of iap how it effects life this is not an immediate effect hence people relate immediately hence requires a strong and reinforcing message to educate this campaign should be a campaign similar to a pulse polio aids campaign initiated by government of india these campaigns have taken the issues of polio and aids to a level where no other media would have created the impact for ex simple things like the cough due to excessive inhaling of indoor smoke iap is often referred by the user as a normal health issue due to weather changes etc this is a small example but many more to quote due to the lack of decision maker is man and not the user the decision maker in a house is man cases it is an easy job to convince the woman of the house as they could be convinced by demonstrations but the final decision of buying or not depends upon the man getting convinced the man of the family needs to be educated on the cost of technology by way of proper messaging of both the technology and the product in itself a projection of the savings over a period of time in terms of fuel health and time should be materialized to make them understand and subsequently convince on the recommendation protocols and standards consider a situation where the user and the decision maker is convinced on the need to adopt clean cooking stoves and agree to the iap part of the issue but do not know how to differentiate one stove from another it is a further critical situation which needs utmost attention there needs to be a proper and defined standards for testing these products the standards should be a bench mark to judge which stove is a clean burning one and which one is not the standards should be made aware to each and every one who wants to take up improved cook stoves on a commercial or social angel not just drafting the standards but also checking on the proper availability of testing labs and equipments which would test the stoves as per the set standards for any of the ex we at envirofit tested the stove at multiple locations in india and testing standards were different hence the results were different now this is a dilemma for any manufacturer as the results are what matters at the end of the day and if the testing standards and protocols are not in place then there is no way of getting an improved stove which would be approved and accepted by everyone and by the designated of quality once the awareness is raised and a user is convinced with the fact that improved cook stoves will change their lives then comes the question of which stove has to be bought this dilemma can be solved only if the shortlisted improved cook stoves have a symbol of energy efficiency label of recognition and accreditation that these are the best of the improved smokeless stoves available for money the stoves should not be given for free rather should be subsidized and a part of the money should be paid by the consumer a free item loses its worth the moment it is declared as free and is not used with the requisite supervision monitoring and timely and timely surveys of the stoves should be collected either before launching the launching the project directly from the field from the consumers results in the lab should not be the only way to decide on a stove being very good but at the same time the ease with which a user can use the given stove is what would matter if the stove is too complicated to requires too many preparations then the user would discontinue the stove within a few days and get back to the three stone chulha itself and spread negative word about the stove there needs to be training for this habit option an easy option of providing micro credits to people through banks for buying the product should be looked at the product since should not be given free could be given on easy payment options which would give them a value for money and value for from kerosene the amount of subsidy given in the form of can be revised to encourage more people to use and accept clean burning cook stoves in to their life this would reduce the dependency of fossil fuels for cooking purposes as well as ease on the shortages of the fossil fuels this could be done at the government of india level policy making credits as you might be aware that the improved cook stoves reduce the emissions which could be turned in to a carbon credits project this could be used for the awareness generations or any cost subsidy to the user and government can link this with emission reductions the outcome from the carbon credits can be used for funding the awareness exemptions to entrepreneurs the taxes applicable such as import duty should be exempted for such energy efficient products and motivate the manufacturers to device such clean energy product for the benefit of usage the improved cook stoves should be able to operate on any kind of bio mass fuels available in the market and not be specific to only one kind of fuel these restrictions on fuel type usage increase the disliking element in the users and an additional cost to the user it is also a huge habit change which cannot be done all at once when there is such a huge free availability of biomass at the rural for testing on an immediate basis an emission or a testing lab to be setup in india in collaboration with a well emission testing lab globally this will help the stakeholders to align on a common platform and serve the rural market dissemination areas concentration of the project should be in areas where there is plenty of bio mass availability this would encourage the people to use the product and benefit from the for dissemination the govt channels for delivery dissemination should be made available for awareness generation delivery sales of the stoves the channels to be considered are the indian posts pds rural retail outlets ministry of women child development centres awareness in schools the kids would be a major influence on the parents for the purchase of stoves hence the usage of stoves in anganwadis and the iap education in the rural schools would be a major would be more for discussion on the nd and rd march workshop and look forward to the detail agenda from your b of stoves of new and renewable block cgo delhi deepak mnre gauri

appendix e of cook stove previous cook stove rural technology rural technology institute arti was the technical support unit tbu for npic in maharashtra from april to march and has since partnered with philips and the shell foundation to continue distributing cook stoves as the tbu for npic arti had notable success in promoting the commercialization of cook stoves in order to ensure uniform quality of cook stoves moulds of the various models were created to be used for these cook stoves were delivered to households within a to kilometer radius centre for application of science and technology for rural development castford tbu before arti selected hereditary potters who were already constructing traditional stoves to become the self employed workers in addition to giving these potters special training in the construction and maintenance of improved cook stoves the tbu encouraged them to start their own improved chulha manufacturing enterprises by providing information about financial assistance when arti took over as the tbu it organized annual improved cook stove training and entrepreneurship development courses for the furthermore the novice entrepreneurs received extra assistance in acquiring improved cook stove installation contracts so that they could gain experience and become established as the suppliers of improved cook stoves in their this program was so successful that when npic ended the did not seem concerned about maintaining good business selling improved cook stoves without subsidies in the open market thus commercialization had successfully promoted usage of improved cook stoves in rural after arti stopped receiving funding from npic the shell foundation stepped in to provide funding for cook stove dissemination programs the shell foundation also brought in accenture development partnerships to give business mentoring and advice to arti about training the local the shell foundation also provided funding to development alternatives da which sold stoves under breathing space pilot and established connections with tarahaat a marketing network that sells products in rural areas and has contacts on the local astra used an entrepreneur model to disseminate cook stoves in karnataka the entrepreneur distributed the stoves as described in box this method has proven successful for a number of reasons including the nature of the program link between profit and quality maintenance after construction education of users and the entrepreneur only builds a stove when a household is ready to purchase one the fact that the entrepreneur continues to make sales proves that there is demand for these stoves the need to earn profits and keep up a steady demand for stoves motivates the entrepreneur to maintain high quality construction and in addition to repairing stoves that were broken or performing poorly the entrepreneur imparted user education about efficient cooking practices since households buy stoves without government subsidies they were in a position to demand quality construction from the shape mergeformat stove dissemination approach adopted by the entrepreneur in uttara kannada informatics and design technology informatics and design endeavours tide bangalore also worked on dissemination of cook stove tide utilized market mechanisms to create local infrastructure for the dissemination of stoves developed by tide in collaboration with the institute for youth and development iyd sold the stoves without subsidies and ensured consistent quality by constructing stoves with moulds women were selected to be make stoves as they could best understand cooking needs and be better able to communicate the benefits of an improved stove the women entrepreneurs could only construct stoves in the few villages surrounding her own and were be able to service the stoves after construction since the woman entrepreneurs were held accountable for the stoves she constructed she was motivated to build stoves stove construction was an venture but women did not feel comfortable leaving the security of agricultural labor to construct stoves therefore tide promoted this activity as one that would supplement their agricultural income partnered with local ngos that possessed the skills to work within the rural context understood the dynamics of the villages and were trusted by the local communities instead of training individual women the rural ngos trained groups that could operate the stove business as a and divide the tasks among the women the group was selected based on their motivation and socioeconomic statuses of its the training sessions included the following to a smokeless convenience and positive impact on health when cooking on a smokeless of stove construction during construction by the construction by women trainees at the training construction by women in houses where would be used for the stove construction manual and its and to a quiz on stove construction for the trainer to understand if the women grasped the discussion session training tide and iyd provided support to start up the in the form of financial assistance technical and promotional materials to advertise the stoves to the national improved stove program and national improved stove program nisp successfully distributed approximately million improved cook stoves into rural areas of china and about of these were actually adopted and nisp is widely considered the most successful improved cook stove initiative in the developing world a number of factors contributed to this success but some of these factors come into play only in the chinese context according to smith et al chinese started from a higher compared to indians in rural areas chinese villagers have a higher income and thus are more capable of paying for furthermore previous promotion of biogas and had established extensive rural energy infrastructure nisp could build upon these experiences and rural energy channels to disseminate a large number of cook the advantages china may have over other countries india could learn some lessons from nisp box unlike npic nisp worked the best areas in other words nisp looked for the areas that not only needed the improved stoves but also was financially managerially and technically prepared to take on the program and had sufficient biomass furthermore counties needed to prove their motivation to actually execute the program by competing in a provincial contest to be selected as a pilot county by the bureau of environmental protection and energy signed contracts directly with bepe in order to cut out middlemen and eradicate an excessively long bureaucratic pathway by minimizing bureaucracy nisp was able to operate more efficiently but systematic monitoring and evaluation was integral to the success of nisp in china provincial rural energy offices this acted mostly independently selected and oversaw teams that would check the use and condition of improved cook stoves in households without evaluation there is no way to ensure the adoption proper use and working condition of the stoves consumers paid for the stoves in full without government assistance the chinese government provided very little financial support only of what utilized for administration promotion and training households were more interested in properly using and maintaining the stoves when they have invested fully in it themselves therefore the adoption rate was much higher by minimizing the amounts of money flowing between bureaucratic levels for instance the largest transmission of funds was from bepe to a county nisp reduced turf the temptation to graft and inefficient delays in transferring money between multiple ensured sustainability of the cook stove program strategy to fully commercialize cook stoves involved supporting rural energy companies these enterprises generated demand and sold other rural energy technologies in addition to improved cook stoves thereby providing multiple energy solutions to rural factors of nisp program that could be applied to an indian improved cook stove selected current cook stove developed new cook stove models the models are both natural draught and forced draught and the price of natural draught model is rs and that of forced draught in the range of rs rs the company is currently discussing with various state governments the possibility of adoption of the model in the ongoing or future state government initiatives on improved cook shell foundation is providing funding to envirofit international which is based at colorado state university csu and working closely with engines and energy conservation laboratory to develop and disseminate improved cook stoves in india envirofit is working with local indian distributors to come up with rural supply chains for the cook stoves envirofit intends to achieve its goals through business model driving economic market research disciplined research and development modern product development process robust durability and emissions global supply chain supporting centralized distribution sales networks marketing strategies partnerships with global organizations and local mfis ngos and global awareness raising and brand building about envirofit and the problems we look to energy petroleum bp and later first energy have sold over stoves mostly in maharashtra and karnataka and some in madhya pradesh and tamil nadu stove called in hindi is fueled by pellets made from agricultural waste the oorja stove utilizes pellets because energy discovered that users saw chopping wood into small pieces for the firebox as an obstacle and preferred a steady supply of processed fuel that requires minimal additional the waste must be pelletized in manufacturing facilities each of which is at the district level and serves a radius of to kilometers first energy recognizes that while increasing stove production should be relatively straightforward scaling up fuel production will be more stoves and pellets are delivered through distributors at the regional level and a network of dealers of these dealers are women entrepreneurs and are shops that are involved in other these women entrepreneurs called demonstrate how the oorja stove works to the village and then sell motivation and family support are important criteria during the jyoti selection process after which they receive training in demonstrations and the receive training in cooking technology so that they understand and can explain the product they are selling first energy intends to invest in creating more networks and distribution channels from the ground up in order to extend the reach of its product so far villagers have not received any financial support but first energy wants to explore financial options such as microcredit loans in areas where people cannot afford to purchase the stoves and biomass existing programs with extensive delivery lever limited has an extensive marketing and distribution network and as of december delivers its products to villages including all villages with populations of more than two thousand residents and cities and towns initiatives such as project shakti and the global partnership for hand washing with soap continue to expand the reach of products into more shakti is a campaign by hll to market its products to rural areas by engaging village women as entrepreneurs who reach out to their communities hll has created a new channel for distribution of products and information as of january project shakti had entrepreneurs serving over small villages with a total population of around fifteen million people in fifteen order to select women entrepreneurs hll contacts local ngos that can provide connections to groups hll chooses women from these shgs who live in villages with populations of less than two thousand people and only one woman is chosen per village and within a radius of one these women are given basic training in sales and accounting to run their own businesses selling hll products either in small shops or by going in the hll is partnering with the indian bank which gives loans to shakti entrepreneurs to purchase hll products to women might be able to disseminate more than hll products education campaign is considering utilizing these women to spread awareness and distribute similarly if project shakti agrees to take on a cook stove initiative these women might be able to disseminate information about the benefits of cook stoves and how to obtain them if not sell the stoves themselves because project shakti is concerned with hygiene and health the cleanliness and health benefits of reduced indoor air pollution with improved cook stove adoption would be partnership for handwashing with global partnership for hand washing with soap aims to promote health and hygiene on a global scale by collaborating with as many interested parties as possible in various countries throughout the developing world hll saw this marketing opportunity for its soap products and partnered with the government of kerala to spearhead this initiative in india with scientific credibility provided by the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine center for disease control and the environmental health project and funding supplied by the world bank usaid unicef and the water and sanitation kerala state government allowed hll to exploit existing infrastructure in order to reach as many people for as little money as possible through government channels such as schools and clinics the hand washing campaign is capable of reaching every village in kerala yuri jain of hll explained that in kerala have the entire government at our we have schools sic social worker centers health centers we have whereas the company itself only do so much we can only cover x number of villages on our order to encourage behavior change the hand washing program reached out to people through direct contact and mass media campaigns direct contact was accomplished through health and social service institutions and schools when women visited the health and social service institutions they were given information about hand washing because these visits were often during events or times when people are most likely to adopt new behaviors such as giving birth or receiving vaccines this strategy was successful furthermore hll carried out an educational program in schools that included four health and hygiene days and compulsory hand washing during lunchtime the hand washing mass media campaign covered every type of media and did not display hll or other brand names or logos it is estimated that the direct contact campaign reached of households in kerala nine times per year and the mass media campaign reached of households times per separate initiative in schools called swasthya chetna promoted lifebuoy products in villages by targeting children and their parents as part of the school program children paraded through the streets of their village chanting slogans about hand washing and prepared and put on skits and presentations about hygiene for the entire village this reinforced their learning after the school day and passed on the messages to their communities furthermore village elders who are very influential on the behavior of the residents of their villages are educated about health and this program has been successfully adopted in a modified form for the global partnership for hand washing with hand washing initiatives have proven the success of utilizing government channels and the same could be done for cook stove dissemination if state governments or the government of india grants access to these channels health institutions and schools could focus on the health benefits associated with improved indoor air quality while social service institutions could emphasize the benefits of reduced time spent on cooking and gathering fuel wood these institutions have the greatest impact on behavior change and may be able to not only create demand for cook stoves but also convince people to actually use is an initiative by itc to connect rural indian farmers with the global agricultural market through internet kiosks in villages in each village itc recruits a a local farmer who manages the internet kiosk in his home for each transaction completed through the kiosk the sanchalak acquires a commission itc thus employs the entrepreneur model the selected sanchalak is someone in the community who the farmers trust for many farmers who may be illiterate or the sanchalak who is trained in computer use and maintenance is a human for the computer village trust in the sanchalak is upheld by requiring sanchalaks to continue farming and establishing the role of sanchalak as similar to a public office rather than a businessman seeking profit the projection of the sanchalak as a public office is strengthened by the title itself a title is a sign of status and a ceremony in which the sanchalak takes a public oath to serve the farming community in front of the focuses on the members of the household who are least affected by the cook type of program might not be the most effective to disseminate improved cook stoves however the importance of village trust should be addressed in any cook stove kisaan bazaar kisaan bazaar started in in del panderva hardoi district uttar pradesh with a store that sold agricultural goods such as animal feed pesticides fertilizer and farm implements by mid hkb had expanded to thirty each serving about to families and to hectares of farmland within a to kilometer radius figure illustrates the services and goods provided by hkb inventory has expanded from farming goods to products that could benefit the families such as fuel lpg medicine kitchenware electronics apparel cosmetics telecommunication services additionally hkb partnered with icici bank to offer financial services bharat petroleum to set up petrol pumps motorola to sell mobile phones and fortis health world to provide healthcare the philosophy of hkb is to become rural hub providing the entire range of services and products to the rural and partnering with these companies helps them attain this goal under this philosophy improved cook stoves could potentially be placed on kisan kendra kisan sansar kisan kendra tkk later renamed tata kisan sansar tks was established by tata chemicals in in order to meet all agricultural needs similar to hkb tks seeks to be the indian and has expanded from agricultural goods and credit services to solar power products telecommunication services lifestyle products kerosene and petrol partnering with indian tks employs a in which each hub acts as a resource center that supplies goods and services to village outlets as of tks was serving million farmers in villages through shops and hubs in punjab haryana uttar pradesh bihar and west services for rural tkks have training and exhibition halls agricultural training workshops such as in geographic information systems gis computer services and new farming techniques and agricultural film screenings are conducted in the training halls exhibition halls hold educational social and entertainment programs for tata kisan parivar a club that tata developed to strengthen relationships with farmers and their tks sells lifestyle products and has great reach into many villages it could potentially become a successful outlet for selling improved cook stoves furthermore if tks collaborates with the cook stove initiative the training centers could be used to train cook stove retailers and installers and the exhibition halls could be utilized to conduct educational programs for users of improved cook services provided by tata kisan report of biomass processing technologies and identification of existing biomass chains for processed energy and resources institute of the and processing processing manufacturers suppliers for biomass processing of existing cook stove experience for supply of processed fuel with existing biomass processing technologies economy and population grow the country should seek domestic and renewable energy resources to feed the growing energy demand india is a developing country and agriculture has always been the mainstay of its economy accounting of of its gross domestic production during it constitutes the backbone of the rural india whose inhabitants are more than of total population resources are plentiful and sustainable resource in india but an about one quarter of the biomass resources remain unused a lot of agricultural waste is generated but only a portion of the kinds of agro waste produced is compatible with current processing technologies much of this agro waste is already being used in rural areas without processing the most important thing about raw material is that there is tremendous variation according to species even within a given species there is significant variation according to region growing conditions and climatic conditions many varieties of biomass are utilized as energy sources biomass can be directly combusted as loose matter fed into gasifier plants for thermal applications or electricity generation or densified into briquettes or pellets to serve as fuel in boilers households use loose biomass for home cooking and some industries and power plants also combust biomass directly burning loose biomass results in conversion efficiencies of about and large amounts of dust and ash pollution therefore processing of biomass and densifying it any form not only improves the quality of fuel but also increase the thermal efficiency of report emphasizes on the status of biomass processing technologies and entrepreneurs involved in briquette and pellet process in india existing supply chain to the target peoples mostly rural areas for processed fuels the report also address the limitation and constraints of the existing technology with respect to new generation cook stoves existing supply chain energy and cost incurred in it and provided herewith some recommendation to overcome these of the of existing biomass processing of existing supply chain for processed of processing technologies with new generation cook constraints with respect to power capacity and the strategies to overcome the technology and other constraints and processing has vast varieties of residues that can be used as fuel for cook stoves residues such as sawdust coffee husk rich husk are in a ready to use form other residues require processing and pre processing for use in combustion purpose the choice and location of a and processing technology are among the most important components of a processing supply system for woody and agro biomass jackson et al figure shows the most commonly used processing and operations flow chart for pre processing and processing of biomass for use in cook processing on the nature of raw material the most common technologies used in india the rate of biomass drying depends on many factors including ambient temperature relative humidity wind speed season rainfall pattern tree and crop species and its size drying of raw material is often required and can be done by open sun drying or with a hot air dryer there are added costs in allowing biomass to dry before processing size reduction of the raw material is done with chippers chippers are heavy machineries wt in these chipping machines require power and litres of fuel to run pulverization reduces biomass particles in size by repeatedly pounding them into smaller pieces through a combination of tensile shear and compressive forces pulverizers accept a wider range of piece sizes they will even accept short pieces including stumps tops brush and large forked branches the pulverizing machines too require high power inputs a hammer mill with a capacity of has a power requirement of hp dhingra et al of biomass can be achieved by different processes briquettes are of standard composition and size usually mm in diameter and has a density of from loose biomass of density to or piston press and screw extrusion machines are two main high pressure technologies that are used for briquetting while briquettes produced by piston press are completely solids screw press briquettes on the other hand have concentric hole which give better combustion characteristics due to large specific area in india the present capacity of individual machines ranges from to briquetting is not only option for processing biomass pelletization of biomass into short narrow cylinders could provide comparable benefits with lower production costs and less energy intensive but pelletizing does require more steps than briquettes in the production process the material must be ground steamed to soften the material pressed through the roller and die and screened to isolate pellets from dust and unpelleted mass manufacturers and suppliers for biomass processing analysis of biomass processing technologies there are a few indian engineering firms manufacturing biomass briquetting and pelletizing machines for the present report information obtained from suppliers and manufacturers on biomass densification technologies were collected and summarized for understanding the existing technologies and its applicability for effective application in the rural sector manufacturers in briquette manufacturing size dia in capacity requirement fuel tech pvt ltd to granulated material vertical feeder gear box and tech agro to to engineering to jumbo models require biomass of proper size and moisture content less than engineering hbp models require biomass with moisture less than and must be powdery or up to mm engineering enerprises to high power for motors and mould agni engg to above tabulated information on briquette manufacturing machineries capacity power requirement and method of production it appears that briquetting technology is not suitable for fuel processing in rural areas as the machines require high power input and also production capacity is huge as compared for a small community necessitate the briquette processing technology is mainly for the production and be used for commercial purposes moreover for the new generation stoves with the requirement of fuels the available briquette sizes are generally unmatched a hypothetical case describing the constraints between the capacity of existing biomass processing machine and fuel requirement for a rural area is mentioned in box manufacturers in pellet manufacturing counter the problems of size of briquettes available status of pelletizing technology in india was examined in india only a few names are found in the list of manufacturers who supply pelletizing tech agro delhi supplies pellet presses in few models which produce pellets of size mm in diameter the output capacity of pellet plant is to with different models which is huge production for household or village utilization engineering also has pelletizing machines which produces pellets of to mm in diameter and production capacity is metric hr energy has gained experience with development of biomass pellets fuel processing system based on both indian fodder pellets machine and imported fuel palletizing machine they have set up two local fodder pellets machines having capacity tpd modified for fuel pellets applications in addition they have set up one imported fuel palletizing machine having ton per hour capacity as part of their cookstove dissemination work the company is able to supply the processed fuel at rs to the endusers these machines are mainly used with saw dust and a few agricultural residues as feedstocks based on the discussion it was clear there is need to these machines on widely available agricultural residues and to reduce the overall operation and maintenance costs of these machines clean energy a company based in gujarat also has gained experience with pelletizing machines and produces pellets based on locally available residues in the state of gujarat the pellets are used in their captive biomass power plant and also sold for industries as boiler fuel the detailed information about operational costs and system performance was not available in public domain of existing cook stove models the aim to address the issues like flexibility in using biomass fuel ie to use locally available fuel adaptability to cook variety of food items adaptability to the usage of different types of vessels many organizations have contributed their valued efforts in designing their versions of the cook stoves the specifications of the stove models developed by ngos are summarized below in table different models of cook stove and their natural draft wood size output kw for forced draft and kw for natural time x efficiency rural technological institute sampada and

swosthee and gasifier stove brochures of organization information collected from conference on biomass cook the survey of new generation cook stove it was observed that these stoves demand specific fuel supply for desirable performance there are some other limitations with the dissemination of cook stove technology linked with the processed fuel supply chain the same is addressed in following experience for supply of processed fuel slow rate of spread of improved cook stove technology has been attributed to the existence of several barriers which have been identified in several studies jagadish focusing here one major barrier that is the fuel required for these improved versions of cook stoves whatever the cook stove is available the is the fuel to burn if the fuel used is improper it will certainly affect the performance of cookstove therefore it is important to concentrate on the chain of fuel supply fuel supply chain consists of following components raw material available and processing technologies supply of processed fuel and cost incurred in its use desirability of a fuel in rural areas is based primarily on three factors price reliability and supply in this section we will discuss about the available strategies for fuel supply in rural areas for improved cook stoves and the new approaches to overcome this organizations work on different strategies to fulfill the fuel requirement in the rural india the case studies in this respect are mentioned here in box and is very unfortunate that these kind of running models is very limited and generally get stopped due to one or another constraints thus as there is unavailability of processed fuels people used to fulfill their combustion needs with the local raw form of biomass available with them therefore sufficient supply of processed fuel at their doors will attract them to use the same because using processed fuel not only help in increasing thermal efficiency of cook stoves but also reduces problem of indoor air pollution iap which causes the premature deaths of approximately women and children in india every year smith k with existing biomass processing of the major requirements for large scale deployment of cook stoves in rural areas is to set up decentralized fuel supply linkage around the target areas the limitations associated with biomass processing technologies are constraints limited capacity to assess adopt adapt and absorb technology the briquetting industry overall has stagnated in recent years while some manufacturers are still producing biomass briquetting machines many have diversified into other industries or have closed their doors altogether some of the key barriers in the current biomass briquetting technology are highlighted of the commercially available briquetting machines are of high capacity and produces briquettes required for high input energy and hence not useful for rural applications current biomass briquetting technology utilizes certain types of raw materials only and highly sensitive to raw material major problems in the current technology are on account of high wear of moving parts the processing technologies require fuel of specific characteristics these increase the operation cost of the technology moreover indian machines experienced more breakdowns and required more maintenance lippert at al capacity constraints of existing processing technologies are linked to the production as discussed before size of briquettes pellets obtained from processing technologies are quite big to use in existing cook stoves the cook stove models available required very small sized fuel to burn eg the prototype named sampada works on wood chips pellets and shavings etc cook stove requires wood pieces of specific shape and size and astra stoves iisc model require cutting wood into smaller lengths availability of such specific fuel is bit power requirement is very high for briquetting plant a plant producing mm dia briquettes takes to kwh to produce one tonne of briquettes the grinder or hammer mill use power from the grid the hot air dryer that dry raw material also requires power one study estimates that the energy needs usually amount to of briquettes produced dhingra the requirement of these and processing technologies is not feasible in rural areas therefore there is need to research on biomass processing technologies which require low energy inputs has minimum wear and tear and upgrade the biomass to increase its thermal technology in europe the dominant biomass fuel is pellets even the households and small business markets highly rely on pellets in india pelletization technology is not mature none of the europeans had a strong interest in technology transfer citing mostly infrastructure problems and managerial inexperience lippert et al the quality of raw material available in both the countries india and europe differ in their moisture content texture heating value and other physical properties the high quality sawdust in europe has enabled europe to pursue complete standardization of wood pellet composition in india such standardization is not possible because the raw material used in different regions shows variation the indian industry is characterized by many kinds of raw materials that differ in size shape heating characteristics moisture content etc in addition european machines are often too costly for indian entrepreneurs to import the second major limitation of the existing biomass processing technologies is the cost incurred in the process the cost of the processed fuels is quite high as the processes and operations involve in densification of biomass are costly the cost of the processing technologies increased due to the following material cost it was found that to of production of pellets is on account of raw material cost biomass processing entrepreneurs face three costs associate with raw material first there is cost of raw material itself which entrepreneurs tend to purchase mainly from consolidated suppliers or sometimes from individual farmers and producers depending on the raw material and the region second there is cost of drying grinding and otherwise processing the raw material to make it suitable for processing into pellets thirdly there is the cost of transportation of biomass from source to machines and finally to cost energy cost to run processing plants often exceeds original project estimates for an example the briquetting machines require units of power per hour some other processes require power from grid

requirement a village of families with average family members is the fuel wood consumption in a village is jagadish and therefore average fuel wood consumption will be and by using improved cook stoves and proper sized fuel efficiency increase by then fuel wood consumption will reduce to half of the existing consumption and then total fuel wood consumption will be decreased to and which is approx for a village of families we consider the hrs operation per day then the capacity of processing machine required should be but on other side looking available processing technology we found that the minimum capacity exist will be much higher than the required in a rural studies existing strategies for supply of processed strategy developed by published paper of winrock international small pellet stoves for rural customers tested the models among the rural consumers a team of businesswomen was engaged in selling of cook stoves and fuel pellets made up of agricultural waste

httpaddr is now in fourth year raised two rounds of financing from angels institutional investors and now employ more than people based my experience as a founder and as a judge in this i have a few tips for next my top tips for entering a business plan submit a plan until you have traction my biggest surprise a judge was the lack of traction demonstrated by many of the three of the six plans i judged even have a website the investment round of the uw competition judges are asked invest a hypothetical so the same mentality used investors in the real world comes into play in the investors in the real world pick companies that have momentum that demonstrate that they can execute execution is everything a and to stand out in a business plan competition more progress than your competitors simple things like having website even if it just says coming soon a working a first pilot completed or actual paying customers will go a way to make you stand out customers using or paying for product is particularly important as this will help unknowns and back up the assumptions in your business plan real world be complete there are some critical things every business must cover make sure that you cover all of these things even briefly there are tons of great sites out there with advice what to include in a business plan so i elaborate but suggest that you find out who the current thought leaders are regards to business plans and make sure covered two to three of the plans i read had critical elements write like a ny times reporter write in clear objective and avoid unsupported claims investors pick teams in which have developed trust this trust begins with the words you put your plan sound like a playground braggart boasting your future billion business instead build your case piece piece in an objective fashion using real data the key claims you make in your plan should be well supported with evidence gathered through experimental learning or market your team investors invest in people not plans plans i read simply listed the names of the people without any bio at all this gave me no chance to get to know team why should i invest in you what makes you positioned for this opportunity showing personality is find mentors to critique and edit your plan there are two types editors you should seek first and most importantly find that has credibility in reviewing business plans and have critique it for content and completeness find someone who hold back on asking the hard questions judges will likely these same weaknesses so knowing these in advance and something about them even if you simply point the weakness out a risk will help inspire further trust that you have things fully through second find someone who can help you writing and tone this

coming httpaddr last edited by ngs leaders at am comments return of finished genomes hybrid sequencing strategy boosts accuracy permanent genomic july kevin davies two new papers in the july issue of the journal biotechnology one from michael schatz and colleagues at cold harbor laboratory the other from a team at pacific biosciences demonstrate the value of combining long but relatively reads from pacific instrument with shorter read lengths from the hybrid error correction approach shows its potential in assembly of a variety of microbial and more complex genomes that of the parrot and could have ramifications comparative genome analyses microbial genome analyses and the of structural it could also provide a timely scientific and commercial boost sequencing platform which is facing competition and striving to allay the perception that its lacks the accuracy of its more established many people hear this raw accuracy figure for pacbio data say can i do anything with the cold spring harbor paper shows you can do some pretty impressive stuff says jonathan bingham product manager informatics this error approach allows the return of the era of finished long reads can be efficiently assembled in combination complementary short reads to produce assemblies not possible says michael schatz a senior author on the cshl when pacbio launched its sequencing platform to fanfare in the sky was the limit the founders executives promised the minute genome by with read lengths and a dazzling interplay of advanced physics not everything went according to plan however like helicos sequencing platform before it there was resistance at forking big bucks for a machine weighing close to metric ton more significantly the stochastic nature sequencing meant that by own admission the past months the accuracy of any single dna read unsatisfactorily around the percent on the business front the company had to ride out an downturn at one point shedding about one third of its workforce founding ceo hugh martin battled multiple myeloma martin was by sequencing veteran michael hunkapiller last year tasked lifting the sagging stock price with the competitive of nanopore technologies looming on the but pacbio did show its stripes last year identifying the strains behind the cholera outbreak in haiti and the ecoli poisoning crisis in germany and a recent software release paves way for the pacbio platform to provide direct detection eventually identification of epigenetic modifications hybrid the idea of marrying long reads with the shorter higher abundance reads produced on an illumina or other platform has been mooted for some time explains with sequencing platforms such as illumina solid and was really cheap to get a draft sequence but very expensive to get finished genome with systems you can get a draft quickly and relatively inexpensively but to close the genome you to go back in and do sanger sequencing pcr and so on a painstaking process the cost compared to generating an illumina genome was about you might spend one lane of illumina a rough draft of a bacterial genome but to get a finished genome had to do of sanger although using slightly different approaches the two new clearly demonstrate the benefit of sequencing the same template dna two platforms and marrying their respective strengths the of pacbio with the higher integral sequencing accuracy the illumina the cshl hybrid error correction approach was developed phillippy and sergey koren national biodefense analysis countermeasures center maryland along with cshl colleagues schatz and dick this mathematical fix released as code produced finished genome for much less money than a sanger finishing says bingham he adds that the ability to produce a composite with accuracy around suggests that high error rates with long reads need not be a barrier to genome the cshl pbcr pacbio corrected reads strategy aligns the illumina reads against the longer read pacbio data trimming correcting the data before taking the consensus of that alignment typically above and develops a finished assembly about the pacbio reads are retained for the final assembly although figure should increase with newer two general approaches have gained traction for de novo genome the olc paradigm a graph is from overlapping sequencing reads and the de bruijn graph the graph is constructed from the authors found that olc assembly approach became more powerful as read lengths whereas the de bruijn method reached a plateau and so built approach around the the best results were obtained using the celera assembler developed eugene myers and colleagues for the human genome project and over and allora the resulting contigs had a median size least double that obtainable with sequencers alone and in cases a the average length of pacbio reads with the latest c released earlier this year is significantly higher than any available platform says bingham on a typical run you can average read lengths of bases on an exponential distribution you go to the tail you get reads at bases the reads obtained by the cshl group were while the chief application of pacbio has largely been in the world the new paper also demonstrates success in assembling the genome as part of the latest assemblathon competition which says provided better assembly than any system alone the group also looked at the corn transcriptome pacbio reads were enough to span entire rna the cshl group did something really amazing they took the assembler and were able to add on this error correction piece so you have it set up and configured easy to take your iilumina data and your pacbio long reads put them into an automated and get a finished genome at the end says indeed the cshl authors predict that the hybrid approach should able to deliver what bingham calls a perfectly structural genome the pacbio strategy described in the accompanying paper chief science officer eric schadt and colleagues begins with assembly based on the data and then uses the pacbio data conjunction with that draft assembly the method was tested in analysis of the cholera the value of these new hybrid approaches extends beyond microbes just for bacteria it scales up to larger genomes bingham for example the new parrot genome assembly is far to that of any previously sequenced bird genome schatz bingham says the two groups have had friendly conversations about is the better approach for doing hybrid de novo genome assembly concedes however that the cshl approach will attract interest it lets users avoid locking up which could happen you were to first assemble with illumina and then add pacbio in approach if the illumina data had and misjoined etc then not be able to undo the error he the error correction step itself require any black magic relatively straightforward says bingham although he notes there are chimeric reads that need to be caught which requires little skill the approach is not just limited to pacbio and data for example it could be applied to pacbio circular reads and the longer bingham is also excited about the potential to combine this with evolving software for epigenetic detection combined with the base modification software provides something compelling the ability to get a finished genome with a methylome at the same time currently no other way to do he the pacbio long reads are emerging as the gold standard for genomes giving us something given while agreeing that error correction of pacbio reads is important davis bioinformatician ian korf who helps manage the competition for de novo genome assembly argues the real game is read lengths one of the better mammalian was the dog done years ago with sanger sequencing says those reads are only kb and yet the assembly was very good could do x short reads and not get that good an assembly short assembly is a hard problem once read lengths are kb or assembly will become a completely different posted by ngs leaders at pm comments variants disease and population permanent note we are pleased to share the following from genomena a blog maintained by nathaniel pearson director research at the entry is reposted here with permission janine nathanial pearson may nathaniel pearson three new spotlight a glut of rare variants in our genomes with key insights human history and rarity new papers from teams led by josh akey and novembre and a brief theory paper from alon keinan and prolific andy clark highlight a bounty of rare genetic variants our genomes and point out why we should bolstered by the data from more than million copies individual human genes the growing catalog of such rare variants our recent rampant population growth into more temporal relief and should in the long run help finely trace geographic sojourns of particular copies of human chromosome more importantly however many of those rare variants likely centrally in our these basic insights have been clear to geneticists for a time and great to see them percolate through the lay the new data papers scoured every letter of many genes in thousands people and found a bumper crop of spelling variants that are found in just one or a few of those people the third paper what such findings suggest about precisely how big the human has been over time and roughly what they mean for efforts understand altogether the findings cast such bright light on our origins health because under simple assumptions geneticists can predict often variants that do or greatly alter proteins should pop in a given proportion of people if our ancestors were steady number and if proteins especially important for health those are two big the new data highlight that real patterns of such variant in our genomes drastically flout those null expectations and call sensible attention to rare variants which underlie deviation as we search for the genetic basis of disease specifically the papers all underscore two broad insights that been clear for several o our population has skyrocketed but just for the past few millenia a trend left a strong signature of many young rare variants in our o many of those rare variants may be making us a tippy tree laden with rare the findings in the new papers hinge on a simple insight the widely common a genetic variant is the older it likely is this because old variants have typically been carried down many branches the growing human family tree spreading far and wide on the planet contrast variants that just arose recently are typically confined recently sprouted geographically narrow branches of the while details of very early human population dynamics are hard precisely infer the new data along with much other genetic ancillary historical evidence see keinan and citations for starters suggest that our population has extremely fast in the past few millenia such growth has stretched the human family tree at its tips the young look longer in units of generations than otherwise given how long the trunk and inner branches are and because genetic variants pop up roughly randomly by mutation on the as they grow the long tips of the tree harbor more its total load of mutations than they would have had the tree grown a constant you can picture each such mutation as if it were a little brainstorm the head of the late dr seuss had seuss drawn genomic trees he might have represented each mutation as an kind of fruit confined to the branch big or and including its where the mutation struck many of rife rare variants in our genomes can thus be thought of as fruits each confined to just one or a few twigs amid a great in this light the new papers affirm become clear over the few years as we sequence more and more whole still be finding new human genetic variants for a long time after having sequenced many more of and as long as our population continues to dramatically balloon system out of equilibrium in population genetic terms the tree continue to loosely resemble an inflationary universe its branches speeding apart from each other via new mutations in analogy the genetic counterpart of the that signals expansion is roughly speaking the overall skew in toward rarity of our genetic rare variants in visions of the human family tree tips bent toward our probing grasp newfound fruit may recall the myth of another tree apt that the crop of rare variants in our genomes may include much of fruit of human rare variants are thought to figure centrally in disease for related reasons as seen most such variants are rare they arose recently so had time to spread widely among and young variants by definition withstood natural for such selection often assisted by chance tends to keep variants rare or purge them from the population rare variants by contrast are in principle free to more common though chance often strikes them down that is over time consistently harmful variants tend to especially if the population is big enough to stably harbor a variety of alternative variants meanwhile variants that happen not harm their carriers are free to spread whether by chance or in cases by helping their carriers have more kids than others together these trends mean that a snapshot of the rare variants carry today like a worth of the newest tweets likely enriched for items that will soon be either gone or in a cases more and they help explain why surveys of the common genetic covered by fast cheap snp chip screens rarely offer clear into disease risk for a given stretch of the genome such variants do distinguish big branches of the human family tree from other making them quite informative of ancestry but a consensus emerged that the long tail of human genetic diversity all those variants is where find much of the genetic contribution disease spotting which rare variants harm us however turns out to be proof of take the extreme case of a variant found in just one woman everyone on earth if we split humanity into those who get a disease in life and those who our chosen woman must fall one group or the other and if we look at enough diseases eventually fall into the sick group for at least one of but clearly too far a leap to infer that the unique variant carries made her sick that is the distribution among with and without the disease simply be statistically given how rare it is to meet this inherent challenge to squarely implicating a given variant in a given disease geneticists look to leverage insights if the variant really is too rare to show up on screening of more sick or healthy people and a place the new data are already helping us at knome as we intriguing variants for research clients they next ask how it may affect physiology by altering the amount or chemical makeup of protein encoded by a gene that either harbors the variant itself sits near it in the and next they may look at more people with the disease in and ask whether other rare variants tend to cluster nearby in genomes moreso than other in recent years as detailed data on human genetic variation has started to geneticists have been honing rare variant burden tests to find such regions refining such tests and gathering more and phenotypic data to feed them stands to bring many key into the genetic basis of disease and on a time frame shorter we certainly hope than that needed for natural selection itself to all those harmful variants from the crop of rare variants we a new to thoroughly catalog the rare variants that pepper our genomes course we have to read what dna letters we carry at each site in genome rather than just at those sites already known to vary spelling as in snp the newly published work furthers effort by carefully sifting through particular sets of genes in thousands of people more people than have ever been comprehensively sequenced notably the novembre paper focuses on a few hundred already thought to help govern how the body responds to drugs such genes are actually an intriguing testing ground for notion that rare variants crucially shape not just disease risk other phenotypes outward traits many drugs derive from defense chemicals made by plants and molds organic chemists extraordinaires that our ancestors long eaten breathed and otherwise touched but modern folks have tinkered greatly with such drugs concentrating combining diversifying them in our quest to prevent and cure diseases as many drugs and cocktails thereof are like other facets of overall diets fairly new parts of the human drugs we take are thus exposing even the most common read variants in our genomes to novel regimes of natural selection such drugs work better at particular doses in some people than and such variation may often trace largely to variation in looking ahead intrigued to see whether rare genetic variants out to explain unusual responses to particular drugs as well better as they explain particular diseases or whether such variation in drug response traces largely to variants in our tall trees the diversity an intriguing tidbit in the akey paper is a spatial contour overall genetic diversity across thousands of genes in our plotting the classic measure of nucleotide diversity that how often two randomly chosen chromosomal copies of a genome differ in spelling jacob tennessen et predictably found the strongest peak in diversity in the hla cluster on chromosome expressed on the surface of immune cells these genes work in large part to help us fight infection job thought to be well served by great genetic diversity within genome which presumedly helps its carrier respond to many kinds byzantine in its sequence variation hla turns out to play functional roles in mate choice drug response and diseases multiple sclerosis to narcolepsy notably women and other female apes likely pick their mates in part and unconsciously by they smell thanks partly to what versions of hla they and suitors carry such preferences are thought to help preserve variation longer here than elsewhere in the genome so well in that your copies of some hla genes more closely resemble some copies than some other copiesand those hla are likewise closer to yours than to each essentially even the inner branches of the family tree of this part the genome are incredibly long stretching back generations than is typical as see in a coming post the depth of the tree for a given part of the genome can be thought of as rough proxy for how big the ancestral population for that part of genome has over time tended to other peaks in genetic diversity lower than hla but still include odorant receptor and keratin genes which are widely presumed to accumulate functionally variation reflecting less stringent evolutionary constraint in than in some other mammals strikingly however the akey group found that another immune response gene marks a peak genetic diversity roughly as tall as that of the much better known cluster be intriguing to learn more about what does our bodies and whether its remarkable diversity reflects importance or stay tuned on that front as more of us are sequenced and learn much more about which of our variants among the ones and the newly commonplace rare ones matter most and how of what we learn will speak directly to the pending challenges genomically personalized medicine as framed in fervent discussion another recent paper both at large and on httpaddr estimates typically ignore any complications mating variation in mutation rate and so forth but quite moreover the history of human population change has of varied in space among regional as well as over notably the new papers suggest that such variation may be fairly in the grand scheme dwarfed by the remarkable overall recent and keinan and clark note that sample sizes in particular may roughly as much noise to the picture as do real underlying ultimately the length of these twigs tracks how long many chosen pairs of extant copies of our chromosomes have descended separate in the end you likely harbor a dozen or so brand new genetic that arose by mutation only in you but you also likely harbor of other very rare variants that til we sequence your genome have never been spotted in anyone note that this mean that no one with harmful variants has after all everyone carries some such variants and people breeding just fine rather because a given variant can be independently of other variants in the same genome and may wreak only in combination with another copy of itself or some variant people simply tend to have more kids who inherit more of healthier alternative variants than kids who inherit more copies harmful ones moreover much of the natural selection in likely happens beyond our view before pregnancy begins when early embryos fail to implant and thrive in the last edited by ngs leaders at pm comments elusive appeal of exome permanent note we are pleased to share an article submitted by rosenfeld phd jeffrey is a bioinformatics scientist in the of high performance and research computing at the university medicine and dentistry of new jersey umdnj and a research in the division of invertebrate zoology at the american museum natural rosenfeld may jeffey rosenfeld in the past few years prices of sequencing have plummeted and now for a few thousand the complete sequence of an individual can be obtained even so scientists have opted to sequence just the exome coding regions of individual and to ignore the rest of the genome this focus on exome has some justification but i think that it is shortsighted despite the higher cost the sequencing of a complete genome is valuable even if that means sequencing fewer the supporters of exome sequencing generally make the following to justify their a the sequencing of an exome is much cheaper than the sequencing of genome it must be substantially cheaper to sequence of the than the whole b we understand how to interpret variants therefore we should limit our sequencing to genes that are c variants that are associated with a genetic disease are more to be found in a coding region since they directly alter the of a i am not going to deny that there is some validity to these points i think that they outweigh the shortcomings of exome and the benefits of whole genome sequencing that i will outline i understand that this is a contentious issue and i welcome comments whether you agree or disagree with my the first reason the people generally look to exome sequencing is of cost intuitively the sequencing of of the genome the should be cheaper than sequencing the entire genome while this true the price differential is nowhere near and is closer to or depending upon how the costs of the sequencing is currently a whole genome costs and an exome costs are these prices so close to each other the answer is that the reagent cost of running the sequencer is not the only factor in cost of a genome or an exome for either type of experiment prep is required along with the costs associated with setting up sequencing run of any size for an exome there is the additional of purchasing the selection kit which allow one to extract the sequences from raw dna either using a microarray or in solution kit can cost several hundred dollars and is therefore a portion of the cost of exome because of the lack of strong cost differential the economic of favoring exome sequencing is not very strong for the same amount funding a researcher would need to choose between say exomes genomes while samples are obviously better than this is a great differential it is much less than the differential one would naively think of concerning the price of genome and sequences an additional factor affecting the cost of exome is the time required to perform the hybridization for the protocol hours of time are required for hybridization and are required for the agilent approach these times add a delay into time taken from sample to sequence which may be problematic clinical applications as an example the ion torrent machine is pitched as a tool for rapid sequencing that will produce results in single day when an exome is targeted using agilent or nimblegen will grow to at least or days of exome the definition of an exome is somewhat elusive it can refer a all of coding exons of the b a microrna c a utr and utr d unannotated transcripts that have been discovered in experiments or from the encode e all functional portions of the these five definitions will include very different portions of genome and some of them such as e are difficult to define in and themselves it has been shown in multiple studies that there transcription along substantial portions of the genome should all these regions be considered part of the exome in general these are included in the exome kits since their inclusion would push the size the exome much closer to that of a genome and any potential from the lesser amount of sequencing will decrease instead the is generally limited to coding genes with some level of along with micrornas and to some extent each of the different vendors that produce exome kits have different approaches to defining the exome a recent httpaddr the exome selection offering from the three main players in the agilent nimblegen and exome this figure gives a great comparison of the different firstly the approaches to selecting the exome sequence nimblegen uses overlapping dna baits agilent uses rna baits which distinct but contiguous and illumina uses distinct dna baits that not contiguous and contain breaks of sequence because this nimblegen contains many times the number of probes as the two technologies the rest of the figure shows venn illustrating the overlap between the targeted regions for different defintions of human genes refseq and ensembl there substantial agreement between the technologies as indicated by the and of sequence that they all cover the biggest discrepancy with regard to utr regions where illumina has mb that are from the other two a different technique to assess coverage is to look at the amount the exome target from a particular kit that is covered at a threshold to make a confident call of a variant for many scientists threshold of x coverage is required to trust a variant derived an exome sequence any loci with lesser amounts of coverage ignored since the general sequencing coverage for an exome is x theory it should be no problem to achieve x coverage of the targeted region in practice this is not the case for three firstly exome sequencing as with all sequencing produces reads in statistical distribution and not evenly along the genome some regions are going to have their dna sequenced more often and have a higher number of reads this idea forms the basis of the statistics that are used for designing projects the second reason for variation in coverage is that some the baits used for selecting the exomic dna will have a higher than other baits mainly due to gc content those probes with affinity for their targets will produce greater amounts of dna the final concern is due to the repetitive nature of the the selection probes need to target a unique location in the genome ensure that they are truly obtaining the dna that they intend select if the targeted region is repeated in the genome then from all of matching regions will be equally selected many human share domains with other proteins and any shared sequences cannot targetted this is an equivalent problem to the unique mapping sequencing reads which is a big concern in the use of short reads any reads that map to more than one location of the cannot be uniquely placed and are generally these concerns are illustrated in this figure from agilent their sureselect exome sequencing this is an old figure but i think that while the numbers might changed a bit the overall message remains the read depth is variable and you do not achieve anything close to coverage of exome while accurate data is available for of the exome depth x this also means that of the exome is missed in odds this means that for a disease study where an exomic variant with the disease there is a chance of not having the included in the data a researcher could conclude that there is coding variant associated with their disorder when in actuality it just that it fell into the that was missed an error level of is not trivial and cannot be lightly whole when a whole genome is sequenced many of the issues regarding sequencing are not relevant there is no need to buy a kit or to wait for the kit to hybridize while there are biases as there are in any sequencing experiment there are not additional biases introduced from the exome selection overall is probably the standard error in sequencing giving a level of but the biggest gain from a sequencing is that the genome excluding some unclonable regions is obtained if one wants focus on the exome because it is easier to understand and they can easily filter out the portions of the genome obtain an in silico exome this is an easy action to perform and if positive result is not found in the exome then you already have rest of the genome sequenced to begin looking for an intronic related to splicing or a promoter or enhancer variant in traditional exome experiment this is not possible if no variant found in the exome then there is no result and one needs to go and sequence the whole genome again from to give a picture of the fraction of disease associated variants are coding or i looked at the ucsc collection of studies the current list contains unique snps loci that identified as part of a gwas study of these snps of are not within coding genes thus more than half of the important genomic variants are not in coding regions and would not covered by exomes some of these snps may be in utrs or rnas which are targeted by some of the i see this as a betting situation would you rather spend have a chance of getting the answer of spend and have a chance of getting the answer i think that the genome is more reasonable just because we understand does not mean that we can or should ignore it as scientists we an obligation to try our best to investigate human disease and not only focus on things that are easy to as a final point there has been some recent talk concerning that are only found from exome sequencing and not genome these results are not a fair comparison of apples to apples the are generally sequenced at x coverage and the genomes are at x coverage for the specific variants under discussion sequencing coverage is required to identify them from any this x coverage could have been of just the exome or the genome if the whole genome were sequenced to x for a comparison then i am confident that there would not have been advantage for the exome over the posted by ngs leaders at pm comments cancers are the least and most genetic of permanent note the following was originally posted on genomena blog maintained by nathaniel pearson director of research at and is reposted here with permission janine april nathaniel pearson in time finer data and models will test the specific claims of a widely discussed paper by bert vogelstein and colleagues on the prospect genomic risk prediction though the of studies has taken some heat for repackaging longstanding about heritability the fuss over it has usefully underscored complexities of disease and healthcare and thoughtful responses the paper have made clearer to the public that few geneticists the zealous determinists of caricature rather we tend to grasp causal basis of disease and other phenotypes with inclusive but while the dialog may have enlightened many both the paper and critiques have largely missed two pertinent in the world of genetic risk cancers are big inasmuch they prove some underlying and in the context of the paper itself these points nestle into in research twins with tumors are no longer really to see why and fold this point into the wider discourse on personalized healthcare peer briefly through the of cancer gemini cancer and genomic as noted the new paper aimed to summarize what studies of say about how well our genomes alone may predict what diseases get the premise of course is that twins from the same fertilized resemble live runs of a telling thought experiment if you and genome lived twice would you get the same the basic answer has long been clear twins always get sick same way but vogelstein and colleagues reasonably asked particular common adult diseases how often they sensibly they reviewed available twin data for several complex interrelated epidemic killers such as heart diabetes and stroke to boot they also combed the on pregnancy complications an intriguing evolutionary nexus health some nerve and autoimmune diseases and mysterious ailments like chronic fatigue and irritable but nine of the diseases they surveyed the bulk class were cancers and this choice sapped any suspense their findings for while cancers indeed kill many people so study they are long known to be far less heritable that is show a smaller portion of cases running in families than many grave diseases as vogelstein a renowned cancer researcher knows loading a heritability survey with cancers is like padding russian presidential ballot with token dissidents to be fair the authors likely set out to mislead after they could only survey available studies of twins and a big of cancers was ripe to include in the end it supplied all their on the while that study did find some evidence of heritability in cancers it concluded that such heritability little role in most cases bolstering the bottom in the grand scheme cancers rarely run in where the authors be excused so easily is in a hyping their findings as novel while b burying this key grain salt far from headlines and press releases in a brief aside near end of the for diseases with a lower heritable component such as most forms cancer based genetic tests will be even which any clinical geneticist could have told you thirty years and unsurprisingly all nine surveyed cancers in survey deemed less genetically predictable heritable than the other studied nonetheless any oncologist will tell you that cancers quintessentially genetic diseases as see they require are even defined by genomes gone indeed some of the most widely genetic risk underlie rare familial forms of breast and colon cancer whole genome interpretation is finding its first vital clinical in treating tumors along with sick so what gives how can cancers be intrinsically genetic yet so hard predict from our the answer it turns out is that it matters which genomes we the hive to understand peculiar nature as a genetic disease picture your bodyas a colony of bear with me here both entities you and the swarm ultimately teeming masses of individuals cells or bees most of work hard to help just a few of their kind eggs or sperm or queen and few males breed on their in this view the two basic kinds of cells in your body which biologists also call the germline and somatic cells respectively resemble a bee two main castes breeders in a sexual organism like you somatic cells kaleidoscopically in form embodying the many specialized tissues that help a body thrive from moment to moment gametes by specialize mainly in storing dna for coming generations and as slow costly eggs or small fast cheap sperm in finding a gamete to merge in most animals the cells that become the germline split from cells very early in embryonic development as with bee royalty nearly impossible for a somatic commoner to infiltrate reproductively privileged ranks while details prompt debate natural selection is thought to driven the emergence of the and distinctions and in both cases to have brokered a lasting compact between the two kinds of in this contract a somatic cell in your hand like a dutiful bee effectively says to your cousins if you spread our shared genes give my life to help count on me to build sturdy shelter find good food fend attackers write honeyed words to entice a mate and care tenderly the children that come after you do the rest and send our seen in this hobbesian light a tumor is effectively a mutiny somatic cells who break that evolutionary covenant with their cousins a budding tumor cell effectively says no i and die for other cells reproduce myself and proliferating a disease of crucially the cellular treachery of each cancer case typically to one or more sudden changes mutations in the genome of somatic cell the mutations in question may be slight say miscopying of one dna letter from the parent genome or they be drastic as when a rogue gamma ray shatters a whole chromosome the latter case the cell may in mending the resulting fragments dna inadvertently scramble whether slightly or severely altering dna sequence the mutations turn cells into tumors tend to do so in particular ways they either throw or freeze stuck one or more functional switches the budding tumor genome switches that had til then governed the reproduction of that immediate ancestors their proliferation to the overall best interests of the the switches in question are often genes that govern a whether a cell divides or instead takes a form b how the cell exchanges signals other cells eg halting growth at the touch of a neighboring or telling that neighbor to build more blood vessels to bring food and oxygen in some cases the key switch may govern how well cell corrects dna copying errors one mutation in such a gene may spark many more some of which eventually knock out other switches more directly reined in the in the end a tumor grows unchecked thanks directly to one or newly arisen genetic variants that distinguish it from other cells the same body importantly such cellular mutinies are with exceptions typically doomed in their greed for resources rebelling cells weaken the body overall and with no way to sink with the ship that sui all this ultimately means that tumors grow spread kill specifically because their genomes differ from other genomes such cancers are not just genetic in origin but break a assumption underlying paper that monozygotic twins genetically that is as soon as a person is diagnosed with a tumor all premised on her genetic identity or even near identity to a are off not only do billions of her cells now differ from those of her twin but they differ in ways that are definition biologically important that is the distinctive variants in question drastically change the way that cells letting them divide in this sense a tumor genetically distinguishes its host of whom is intrinsically part from other people de facto much as genetic variants may distinguish someone with a strongly disease from other people notably this insight tempers expectation that the twin should get the same disease cancer driven by genetic variants that the twin likely and it underscores the uniformitarian rule that cancers in their heritability seem at first to violate in diseases of all genomic differences tumor genomes noisy mixed the first active clinical uses of whole genome sequencing have been pediatrics and oncology and this makes sense in bluntly formal sick kids and tumors are both masses of cells one beloved the loathed that are growing awry and both growing as too fast for us to wait for sequencing to get cheaper or for knowledge to get deeper sequence now if we can afford to order to gain some foothold into the medical mystery at for tumors in particular we hope that sequencing the tumor importantly healthy tissue for comparison will reveal key clues to how it arose grows spreads and might be slowed killed alas that turns out to be hard to do for three key first as noted tumor genomes are pocked by mutation small changes often abound hiding a few functionally important ones drivers in a cacophony of incidental noise and bigger scales long segments of chromosomes are often missing or scrambled such rampant genetic variation is not just to functionally interpret but also makes it hard to draw an picture of the genome in the first place why it turns out that computer algorithms used in modern sequencing work poorly for that differ greatly from the standard reference genome snippets of raw sequence data that match up well to that like puzzle pieces that closely match the picture on the are hard to correctly place moreover tracts of dna letters appear in multiple spots in a genome like uniform fenceposts in farmscape puzzle are especially hard to accurately sequence acute challenge in tumors where rampant mutational copying and pasting turns the genome into a bewildering house of second each tumor actually harbors not one but a mix of such genomes often with cell genomes inadvertently mixed while a tumor is indeed a clump of closely related cells distinctively share particular variants also a population genetically varied cell lines each effectively striving to grow than the others thanks to its own secondary stock of relevant variants but because sequencing today requires pooling cells genetic variation in the tumor tends to get homogenized as in a blender an important variant carried only in a few cells may be prominent enough to show up in the final reckoning of a tumor genome third the mix of genomes in the tumor evolves partly in response treatment thus we may want to track how treating the tumor with particular regimen kills of some cell lines in the tumor while other lines by chance resistant to the treatment spread quickly best characterize and treat a tumor we might want to see a rather than just a snapshot of its mix of genomes letting us how they change in response to treatment but doing so is for foregoing reasons tough and will be until we can sequence cells at a time for less money and with longer snippets of sequence analogous to bigger puzzle pieces that can be more pieced together to get the whole moving on a late summer afternoon when i was six my mom came to my room next to me and showed me fresh bruises on her arms and legs with determined nonchalance she trained a young attention to a moment of each in her skin was i learned real bloodshed from a below in the marrow of her bones delinquent cells were wrecking the nurseries of sticky platelets that she needed to small everyday blood vessel leaks the bruises were collateral from that mutiny her own cells betraying her and those she she sought treatment but leukemia wore her down quickly halloween night muted by breathing tubes in intensive care she welcome my visit only with a tiny nod and a waiting cup of candy died a few days later at my classmates struggling comprehend from afar sketched colorful cards of condolence that still writing today on her birthday older than she got to be reading long before paper taught me that leukemia little heritability yet i still watch for bruisesand admit to tinge of affirmed relief that among the diseases that the assayed for genetic predictability leukemia came in but the comfort is cold cancers remain an especially vexing kind plague sprung from our own selves tumors are in the terms something like evil conjoined twins growing relentlessly changing they cloak genomic secrets in genomic smoke and evade harshest treatments they are the last at a recent conference i listened to washington elaine mardis explain how she and her colleagues are characterizing the genomes of thousands of tumors their yeoman work building a broadly useful critical mass of detailed knowledge about tumors arise grow and spread but their findings are also real doctors and patients today choose treatments that lengthen and lessen after talk i told her how touched i am not just by her work itself but to know that wash u where my mom earned phd and barnes hospital where she gave birth to me and died spearhead a fight against leukemia and other and proud that my own work at knome supports such efforts thoroughly characterizing tumor genomes and developing algorithms do so better helping clinical researchers spot genetic that directly drive tumor growth or more rarely predispose families to recurrent cancers that work like is leveraging individuated genome data to help people live looking ahead those of us lucky enough to afford good healthcare will likely be talking a lot about tumor genomes with our families friends in coming decades relevant insights will likely guide choices for many of us and those we see how soon other major adult diseases think of surveyed by vogelstein et al but also of liver and kidney mental illnesses breathing problems asthma respiratory infections bone diseases etc likewise become more amenable personal genomic insights first for diagnosis and in the long for prognosis too to those twin in bees as well as ants and termites this compact is thought to reinforced by the fact that a queen and her worker sister may especially closely related often moreso than either would be to own daughter this odd twist of kinship follows from male bees just one copy of each chromosome having hatched from eggs while females have two hatching from fertilized as result bee full sisters share on average of their with each other while mothers and daughters share just in a real hive the numbers are complicated by many pairs of being just with different but that turns out to matter much the strong social contract of eusociality can mathematically understood even without the kinship bee sisters as in many personified examples of rivalry between organisms tumor effective strategy is not conscious but rather mathematical truism that is cells in which a chance mutation the web of reproductive constraint that natural selection has will at least in the short term tend to outgrow neighboring importantly a person may be born with at least one such switch already thrown this scenario underlies rare cases of familial cancer risk cancer can then strike as soon as a second a copy of the same gene or another gene is randomly thrown by new people born with one broken copy of the cell gene for example tend to eventually get tumors in both eyes in cases their working second copy of rb tends to eventually mutate one of the cells of the retina of eye leading to a first tumor later a second such mutation may a retinal cell in the other eye spawning a tumor there thus even in rare forms of cancers that run in families getting tumor requires some new mutation in a somatic cell and that may in turn be driven by some environmental factor such radiation toxins or even infectious germs highlighting that genetic and environmental factors are key to understanding cancers just as in other one tumor that beat the odds living on beyond its original belonged to american henrietta lacks as detailed in compelling personal and cellular biography in doctor took cells without her consent from the ovarian that was killing her and grew them in dishes though born in and scientific misconduct those cells nonetheless proved resilient in laboratory culture and have since spread worldwide as key resource for six decades of biomedical another tumor that slipped the mortal coil of its origins is contagious facial cancer that plagues tasmanian devils the of a fascinating recent paper and some rare cancers germline rather than somatic cells may manage to make gametes enough to transmit themselves rampant cell growth and all coming of course even monozygotic twins without tumors genetically identical the great size and the generations of cell division needed to build the cells in their bodies nearly assure that no single cell in either is genetically identical to the fertilized egg from which they came much less to a typical cell pulled from the other but tumors flout the genetic identity assumption of twin studies more severely the many cells that make up a tumor tend to especially closely related to each other thanks to their recent spurt thus the newly arisen genetic variants that the share and that distinguish them from other cells in the body and moreso from cells of the other twin thanks to the extra rounds of division that separate the two cell lineages in question especially common among the cells of the person overall as such if think of a genome as comprising at each site a weighted of the genotypes of all her cells then a tumor makes her genetically distinctive even beyond the prospect that differences may be more functionally important in tumors than in kinds of last edited by ngs leaders at pm comments competition to

a new era personalized last edited by ngs leaders at am comments genome widespread adoption of permanent note the following was originally posted on from the edge blog and is reposted here with permission march dean gaalaas ceo edgebio i attended the genome meeting last week in sydney australia due to our with the x prize it was my first time at the meeting and i came very impressed at the level of sequencing being presented during talks many of the talks led off by john talk on genomics and were highlighted by michael talk on using profiling for assessing disease risk and heath states through all the talks a central theme emerged in my eyes that the would lead to widespread adoption of ngs as a clinical diagnostic much has been written and said about the promise of genomics and its impact on personalized medicine however that is not the of this spot i would prefer to assess the merits of the premise the cost alone will lead to rapid adoption sequencing as a to me this seems like an overly simplistic view of what is needed bring ngs to the clinic attended many talks over the past years and most believe that sequencing is essential to learn more complex diseases such as cancer and neurological disorders this an interesting parallel to sequencing as a species we humans drawn to the simplistic view of cause and effect in the case of health we tend to think that a change in one gene will cause a state and that by fixing this one gene through a variety of we can cure that disease state however we know this not to be for a majority of when it comes to the adoption of ngs i believe we are falling prey this overly simplistic model the current thought is if we can make sequencing more affordable like the genome that adoption curve will start to go asymptotic to me it seems getting ngs into the clinic as a matter of standard of care will much more complex yes cost plays an enormous role and is a enough starting point but there are many more factors that need to considered the factor that is most intriguing to me and the one have heard least about is how do we get insurers to in australia many of my international colleagues posited that sequencing were to only cost usd that many would turn to it an out of pocket expense as this is a matter of routine for outside of the us fair enough but what will sequencing your once tell you about your disease state presumably you are paying money out of pocket because you suffer at the time from a ailment michael talk focused on looking at his genome several time points referencing his genome at a baseline healthy state versus disease state rhinovirus and so on to me this seems like a very assessment on how to use sequencing as a diagnostic to monitor in the genome over the lifespan of a patient this means having genome sequenced multiple times which makes it doubtful that would be willing to pay as many times as certainly in the us few if any are willing to pay medical expenses so will the genome cause insurers to line to reimburse my thought is no they rush to reimburse even it were per genome the health industry in the us tends to move what could best be described as a gingerly pace standard of care routinely cited and standard of care tends not to change in with discovery or technological advances no it tends to change on legal risk and cost tort reform in the health industry is a cause of mine but not the focus of this post so just look insurers are very black and white when it comes to reimbursement reimbursing for a test will save them money over what is available they can be convinced to change consider if you will is needed to convince insurers that this will indeed save them money reasonable scenario may look like this insurers actuarial tables they have reams of data to support them say that a typical head for insured will stay with the insurance company for an average of years and generate of revenue for the insurance company that lifespan what needs to be shown is that by leveraging ngs as matter of standard of care the amount of revenue generated per head greater than a very simplistic model to be sure but serve to illustrate the point clearly a study could be designed to this correct certainly but how much power would a study like need over how long of a time i came away from the human genome meeting more excited than ever some of the groundbreaking research being done across the globe ngs technology now if we could just match it with research on the cost impact of leveraging ngs in the clinic we will much closer to the promise that the genome

investigators and medical school oer skip to rock rock helping connect you with the nih commitment to supporting the next posted on february by sally talked to you over the past year on many aspects of the research pipeline but one issue the plight of the early researcher has been front and center almost from the first day joined nih over a long period of time nih has made a concerted to make sure that faculty members in their early careers have a chance when they compete against more established investigators if enjoy history a complete description of our programs starting is available on our over the past three decades seen profound shifts in the age at which a principal investigator receives their first the period from to the average age increased nearly years per year since that time the average age at first r award leveled off near for phds it is higher for researchers with an or an shows the average age of investigators at the time of first steadily increasing from to in more recent years our new investigator new to nih policies shifted to numerical targets and you can see a increase of new r investigators beginning in by proportion of new investigators increased to approximately of all competing replicating entry rates not seen since imposition of numerical targets appears to have had little effect the average age at which a new investigator receives their first however in order to encourage earlier transition to independence nih initiated the early stage investigator policy for submitted for funding in fiscal year early stage are defined as being within ten years of completing their degree or their medical number of new and experienced investigators on competing r showing the percent new fall from approximately in to in the early our current policy requires that approximately half of all investigators are early stage investigators but so far seen decrease in the age at entry maybe it is too early to expect impact also made one additional change in the new policy rather than using numerical targets set targets based success rates the success rate for investigators submitting a new application should be the same whether they are new or investigators current policies related to new investigators described on the financial operations webpage note that some the policies are currently being updated for fiscal we believe it is important to continually refresh the pool of scientists and to give them an opportunity to manage their own while they are still relatively young we also believe in the results of our efforts so we are analyzing the outcomes of the new investigator policies for example how successful are new investigators after they get their first award and has that as we fund more of these researchers so as always stay this entry was posted in rock talk bookmark the submitting and tracking administrative supplement age distribution of nih principal investigators and medical faculty responses to our commitment to supporting the next peter doris february at currnet nih policy does not appear to address the question of why younger investigators are not as competitive they used to be rather it distorts competition to achieve desired policy outcome however this does not in fact alter competitiveness of young investigators therefore i expect that current policy will do nothing to the future competitiveness of younger ivestigators it may lessen it as these now successful young come up for competitive continuation the traits that contributed their lack of prior competitiveness have not been identified addressed and they can be expected to fail at higher rates comparably aged investigators who were not provided such because they are now older the effect will be that the average of successful funding would continue to if the proposition that it is desirable to have higher rates among younger investigators is valid not much data on then what is needed is a means to increase competitiveness in investigators one way would be to fully understand what has to this increase in age at first award and to determine there is a way to increase competitiveness for example educational opportunity remedial training the creation incentives to allow young investigators to advance their competitiveness alternatively funding policy could be applied in a way specifically seeks to foster the skills that lead to success competition for example a funding mechanism could be created is specifically directed towards young investigators so that compete against each other success is not the desired excellence is a mechanism to create smaller awards that limited to younger investigators in which they compete with another might assist in developing the skills required to competitive it would also assist in ensuring that we make young scientists better competitors rather than simply give them hand out at the expense of better work from older hot debate what do you think thumb up thumb down drugmonkey february at all this effort and attention out of order pickupsand managed is to stop the increasing trend seriously like or dislike thumb up thumb down bh march at look at the green line in figure like or dislike thumb up thumb down happycamper february at the increase in age for first time awardees is also likely to a reduced number of available independent positions extended or additional postdoctoral fellowships the number of positions has not kept pace with the rate at which young are generated as each mentor produce several to tens postdoctoral perhaps being more stringent with to the number of phds produced and proper guidance for those possess the aptitude and willingness to pursue an academic should be considered right now the emphasis on increasing maintaining a certain level of new scientists seems out of why should every effort be made to give a new investigator advantage when they will soon be facing pay lines of less than percent right now the model appears to be help the next generation of scientists then we will pull the rug from under them when they are i skeptical that such a system will ever be able to adjust levels to a more sustainable level that matches the economic realities of funding biological science in this like or dislike thumb up thumb down ian davis february at this is so on the money i think in some ways the transition is not to first r where the eis is of some help but to first renewal when newer are thrown to the sharks the expectation that a researcher with one r can compete on a level playing with a senior pi with is just ludicrous especially some senior reviewers seem to take the view that a senior pi should get funded even if they write a lousy because they know what they are doing so will not waste money i have seen this happen the reality should be senior pis should be held to a higher standard than junior colleagues finally to say that a leveling off of of first r is an improvement is ridiculous we have spend to years to even have a shot at successful grant aand even that assumes that our own work and ideas are viewed as coming from us rather than mentors especially if we were recipients of training the system is broken at the very least there should be upper age limit on applications so that faculty who have retired years ago are not taking funding away junior pis maybe that way we wont have to wait until middle age to have any chance at all this site seems to pure like or dislike thumb up thumb down o mat february at the hardest transition is not to first r where the categorization is of some help but to first renewal newer investigators are thrown to the this is ridiculous those people have an interval of level funding to generate data publications staff and to generally demonstrate accomplishment of the potential for accomplishment they are better off than newcomers even with the esi hot debate what do you think thumb up thumb down o dana march at most of us in research and i think even at the nih the first renewal for new investigators is the bottleneck the impression i get is that if they enough early stage investigators a few will survive get their renewal survival of the fittest luckiest those with the best like or dislike thumb up thumb down anon february at this data is and should be horrifying the trend line may leveling off simply because by age the new investigators falling out of the applicant pool do the math a year enters graduate school graduates at age completes a postdoc age without a major grant they would have be tenure by age if not sooner therefore it is likely that new policies have nothing to do with the observed like or dislike thumb up thumb down clayton wiley february at the leveling off is while it could be interpreted as improvement of a trend i that it really simply marks a natural ceiling by the age of you are not funded you are not in the game this says much our training programs and the need to expedite the like or dislike thumb up thumb down experienced pi february at you are completely correct peter doris if the kids these days to be nih funded investigators they should compete fairly just we did heck in my day if someone was still mucking around in postdoc for more than yrs they going to make it should return to those days and only give appointments to those can successfully compete within two years of the phd that make it clear we only want the hot debate what do you think thumb up thumb down ian davis february at i really hope this is like or dislike thumb up thumb down tommyo february at heck in your day the payline was with submissions more if you changed the i too seriously hope comments are ment to be like or dislike thumb up thumb down o tcgirl march at excellent point and i would love to the see data against historic paylines eg in was tile today tile what was the payline like or dislike thumb up thumb down divaker february at it may be worthwhile to look at the data concerning r that allowed early stage investigators to compete in a pool based on the data when this grant mechanism was few years ago it was evident that the mechanism was not successful because less than investigators were able successfully compete for an r award any like or dislike thumb up thumb down peter doris february at data is never horrifying only the conclusions that lead from can be do you reach horrifying conclusions from this if so would you advance the discussion by expressing conclusions and the thoughts that lead from the data to like or dislike thumb up thumb down pingback updating the age of first nih r award flatlining bashir february at be very curious to see the data for k like or dislike thumb up thumb down by of and february at the data shown above is interesting and coupled with dr more recent posts httpaddr suggest to that the nih has a challenge on their hands if unaddressed may result in a phenomena for biomedical sciences one of the primary challenges that the faces is how to convert those bright young into successful pis that help to uncover powerful new and mechanisms that will ultimate lead to better therapies cures for diseases that negatively impact human health this has recently been discussed wonderfully in a commentary in nature httpaddr i recently attended a friday evening meeting at my whereby a of a highly interdisciplinary biomedical lectured to an audience that included graduate medical students as well as a diverse faculty he showed a interesting figure that will be published in his book chapter of which i plan to post that data here when it becomes the figure he presented demonstrated that in when of pis were years of age and httpaddr the of publications in the under discussion based on the actual impact of translating basic science to bedside therapeutics was high this associated with a low level of publications in this area published in very prestigious journals in when he showed the data for a whereby pis were years of age or younger there was explosion of articles in the field yet the number of that actually had was the exact until nih changes its policies of promoting quantity over it will not matter how they support the younger generation younger generation is now being raised by an increasingly cohort that understands to maintain or increase their status publishing as much as possible is required regardless the quality this policy will leave a lasting legacy of science and pointless investigation and is a waste like or dislike thumb up thumb down anonymous march at in response to and what world do you live in yes if nih were still at the comfortable nearly that they were when may have in the field or of the number of phd faculty available ratio was what is used to be in day then i would potentially support your heartless and stance but things have changed dramatically not just in but in our global economy and as a result in our very structure for example i would love to know how much real time actually spent taking care of your home and kids if you even today this is the reality of most young and are often couples who equally in responsibilities and are facing nih paylines and such a glutted job market there are about applicants for every piddly little position that is posted so unless people like you are willing limit the amount of nih grants that you receive say no more active at a time or a center plus r you essentially mandate the systematic genocide of the scientist that is in the pipeline ian is to r renewal is not only unprotected there are no nih to favor our apps or to award them with more generous like the new investigators but the most likely where massive hemorrhaging from the pipeline will take place is the use of supporting new and investigators is years alter you will just turn your back on us and let us flow of the like or dislike thumb up thumb down nrs march at this is well said when established investigators have it is ridiculous how can you justify grants f your total is only when a new investigator submits a grant ith time we ridiculed at the study these established investigators survive by haveing postdocs there are instances where the postdocs do not good recommendation from these nih should limit the number actve grants to if nih this then may be then the best new investigator will bring back the r and award incentive grants to investigators who publish in high impact like or dislike thumb up thumb down investigator march at the implications of this policy are so obviously bad for investigators i understand why no one has pointed it out obvious to make the argument simple say new investigators get a grant at thus established investigators are those aged assume a career until a year investigator period new investigators are getting about new grants but only cover about of a career years out on top of this senior investigators typically established more lines of research and can therefore on manage more grant funds easier and more efficiently so the is to force out mid and investigators investigators are in for a big crash this is a bubble pure simple what is the point of funding a lab for years and pulling out the rug after tenure nih administration has become bad as our congressional leaders just kick the can down the and hope it gets better the fundamental problem here is the economic law of supply and demand either you increase the funds the pool or you decrease the number of trainees the system like or dislike thumb up thumb down frederick sachs march at the nih has embarked on a path to remove new investigators form competition of established investigators maybe they it if a young investigator applies for a grant and the revision is not funded they are added to a tsa type list applicants needing extra screening the screening is automated and the result is that these applicants o applicants must write a grant in a new research area using techniques and preparations this new unscientific screen to last for the lifetime of the investigator an nih guideline what is a sufficiently different grant says by example that applicant unfunded for work on a transgenic mouse should preparations to a new investigator is generally trained in a specific area so the nih text algorithm says the new application is says too like the previous one read common words the applicant must a new field with different words and then do some experiments generate preliminary data to show that they are competent in new field and then write a new application and wait six months see if it was sufficiently different and then if they are they might get it reviewed with chance of failure if it scientifically reviewed and not funded they then are added to tsa type list for any new application to be checked against previous thought streamswhy might a competant new applicant for some other kind of all that effort was in tghe name of saving a reviewer from to examine a third or fourth revision it takes a reviewer only a couple hours to compare a new revision to previous application it takes an applicant at least six months learn a new field and write a thought out application it is of the nih to subject an applicant to that has the nih checked the accuracy of grant differences by funded grants from the same lab through the same algorithms are positive that no one has more than one funded grant on a topic if the nih has the data the applicants should should see so they can look at the database and see how to modify proposals to be like funded ones at minimum the nih should have preproposal system so that an applicant can submit specific and an abstract and get an opinion that the changes are adequate guarantee a scientific review before they take the time do write new application and do the preliminary unfunded it is a rare personality that will stay in a grantee position treated so rudely we all know that nobel prizes read new ideas went to investigators whose key work took place as investigators if the nih wants to keep sending their money traditionally funded geezers they should expect no new ideas the tiny drug pipeline suggests they have like or dislike thumb up thumb down struggling too march at all this focus on new investigators is misplaced there is reason to artificially increase the pool of academic into a system that is unsustainable the right number will be to get through on their own without special favors this just resources away from other investigators that already significant investment by nih in model systems and results nih wasting two pots of money one on new investigators that will be able to compete later and all the past investment spent established investigators that will be pushed out to make room review should be equal for all some new investigators will get some old will be pushed out but it will be on merit not because some artificial quota set up by like or dislike thumb up thumb down kope march at what is the goal of nih to reduce the age of first grant improve the diversity and energy of new research to increase likelihood of success for early career scientists if we want change something other than a metric there needs to be a shift that includes both nih and the universities dollar buildings justified with the belief that new research space will be filled with pis who will bring in money to cover their labs their salaries their assistants and the indirects to pay off the loans for the as long as universities look at pis as the university will focus on recruiting only pis with like or dislike thumb up thumb down bellur march at i think it is terribly important to define the purpose of funding is it to advance biomedical knowledge and innovation or to facilitate career development if it is then i fail to see why demographics should be of any concern if is the later then the nih should come up with a two or three system to accomplish its please define what is the central like or dislike thumb up thumb down young female investigator march at be interested to see this data split by like or dislike thumb up thumb down established investigator march at in the early years that some appear to envy the average package for a new investigator was probably times than today requiring quick success at the r game continuation of a research career perhaps one of the reducing the competitiveness of early investigators is level of support they become accustomed to prior to having compete on their own hot debate what do you think thumb up thumb down martin katz march at i fail to understand the goal of giving funding preference to a consequence of this is denying funding established investigators no matter how good or important research is in order to fund new investigators no matter inferior their research is the role of nih should be to fund research that is most likely to result in improved developing young investigators capable of directing such should be left to the universities if nih deems it desirable contribute to the development of new investigators this would better accomplished by establishing an program than by simply funding proposals based on the age experience of i agree with the earlier comment that if preference is given to applicants in the long term this will be counterproductive developing a new generation of scientists younger will see their older colleagues locked out of funding after of investment and will conclude that if they stay in the they will eventually encounter to same fate i have seen graduate students and postdocs decide to leave the field they see the struggles their mentors have in maintaining funding ie having the rug pulled out from under them building up a research like or dislike thumb up thumb down moonbeam march at i think you are alluding to what is really the root cause the lack of young investigators the best and the and too good and too bright to suffer a career in those that do enter the lair given proper because the senior folks are too busy projects to give them a shiny luster the nih programs neither fair nor foulthey are the shifting of chairs on like or dislike thumb up thumb down nms march at nih presides over the distribution of public funds in research that should benef the public therefore independently the age and the status of an applicant the nih should fund the innovative research the one that creates new values in opinion however nih has a poorly utilized channel of that may greatly help in supporting the next generation scientists this channel is the cumulative administrative received by an institution from nih i think that must use a significant fraction of this huge asset to support scientists in a verifiable and transparent manner by supportive conditions for their scientific development rather spending for additional compensation of bureaucracy establishment these articles of expenditure be linked entirely to the intellectual which of course depends on the intellectual activities of faculty and young to ensure that it works the control mechanism over this expenditure by an organization probably include a feedback from the junior faculty not only statistics of successful new grants like or dislike thumb up thumb down young investigator march at to you established investigators you had it much easier and that you are established you do not want to let go of your status and the privileges it affords you you are selfish and increasingly senile you are convinced you are the only with good ideas but the reality is you are spending so much chasing funding to maintain your little empires that it has been long time since you actually did any real scientific work you the why not retire when it is your time why not become emeritus spend your time mentoring young faculty how much is enough you why do you have to run empires until you the structure of nih is an inherent conflict between policy and the established reviewers if it were left to them established reviewers would get all the funding policy makers trying to control this to ensure that science has a future the biological age of the most spoiled most rotten most generation there is on the planet the examine some of the ways by which the experienced fight policies and undermine the efforts for innovation the ones are usually the ones on the study sections a investigator has a bunch of new ideas and a desire to pursue but has little to no preliminary data the established ones hmm interesting idea but here is how it can fail so get to us with more preliminary data by the time you resubmit may or may not have that much more to show then they shoot down and it is over even when policy makers tell them concentrate on the quality of the researcher and the impact of the idea and approach the expis ignore official policy and nail the new idea on the approach of the approach will be weaker the research is not done meanwhile what is it that these experienced pis do to they routinely misappropriate funds from one grant to preliminary data for another when they are continuously they spend half of an old one to get a new one half done which the way is illegal then they put in the new proposal with lots preliminary data no wonder the approach is excellent the work already almost done the expis even recognize this freely closed doors it is the big joke of nih and current academia is this so all of you fair competition posters are you dishonest or just horribly misinformed if you are expis then know how you play the it is in the best interest of the taxpayer to get good ideas out in high reward settings this incrementalism and poor quality of science and stupendous number pointless papers are all consequence of the greed and ego established pis who have managed to pervert the system in such way that it is now both grossly inefficient and if you want to do research there is no reason to have more maybe two because that is all that one can manage remaining actively participating in the research the taxpayer no benefit in funding empires of paperpushers who are maintained diligent and exploited postdocs our system is becoming more more like europe where it is all about ego and politics of science while they do have less funding as a whole produce disproportionately less science exactly because of perversity of the hierarchic system they have produced that where we are headed as like or dislike thumb up thumb down mateo luiz april

significant impact and supporting promising stage investigators as part of commitment to opportunities for new scientists the nih new award supports a small group of exceptionally creative early investigators who propose bold new approaches that have potential to produce a major impact on a broad area of or behavioral research this award complements ongoing efforts nih and its institutes and centers to fund new and early investigators through r grants and other mechanisms continue to be the major sources of support for new and early what distinguishes the nih new innovator award from grants and other traditional nih grant the nih new innovator award program is different traditional nih grants in several ways it is designed to support only a small group of unusually creative early investigators with highly innovative research ideas at an stage of their career the emphasis is on innovation and impact preliminary data are not required but may be included detailed annual budget is requested in the application procedure for evaluating proposed projects qualifications is distinct from the traditional nih peer study section process see section e review process the review is conducted electronically the review emphasize the importance and potential impact of the problem in biomedical or behavioral research the novelty innovativeness of the approach and evidence of the

why is the budget request for this grant mechanism different other nih most other nih grants require you to request an annual either modular or detailed for the new innovator application you are asked to request only the total budget we do not require and will not accept budgetary why are the budget period and project period for this mechanism the for most nih grants funds are made available to the institution a yearly basis for the new innovator award nih will commit five years of funding for each grant from this fiscal ie multiyear this is an unusual feature for grants but it will have no effect on your ability to conduct how much are recipients expected to awardees are expected to commit at least percent of research to the project supported by the new award investigators should not

to the year time period that would allow to extend my esi yes after you have entered the date of your terminal degree the date of residency completion in your era profile the data system will calculate the end date of esi if there has been a lapse in your research during the ten period after your terminal research degree or the end of residency you can request an extension in general the nih consider requests to extend the esi period for reasons that include medical concerns disability family care extended periods of clinical training natural disasters active duty military service any such request will be on a basis to request an extension you must the form for requesting an extension in the early investigator esi period allow at least two weeks for extension request to be

innovator yes you are considered early stage investigator if you were the submitting applicant principal investigator and you otherwise eligible to apply for a new innovator i am the pi on an r grant this provides a significant amount support for my research am i eligible to yes an investigator who is the pi on an r or other but allowable research grant httpaddr is to apply if meets all of the other eligibility however recipients of an phased innovation award combines the review of the r and r phases of the award are considered early stage investigators and are not eligible apply also other grants that support work related to this project will be taken into consideration in and funding after i submitted the new innovator award application but finding out whether i would receive the award i was awarded an or equivalent nih grant may i cancel that grant and accept new innovator no once you have received a notice of award naming you as principal investigator of an r or equivalent grant for you were the submitting applicant pi you are ineligible for new innovator award even if you only held the award for a time and no funds were drawn down from the grant payment for the new innovator award competition if a pending grant awarded with a start date of september or earlier you no longer eligible to receive the new innovator i applied for a pioneer award this year may i also apply for a innovator award if i qualify as an early stage yes however you may not submit essentially the same project both the pioneer and new innovator programs nih policy does allow multiple submissions of the same or essentially the project the new innovator award will not be awarded if you already accepted any grant that would make you i have never had an r grant before however i currently have r grant pending may i also apply to the new innovator program if i qualify as an early stage yes you may apply for a new innovator award if you have grant applications pending however you may not submit the or essentially the same project to more than one program policy does not allow multiple submissions of the same essentially the same i plan to submit an application for an r grant in january this jeopardize my eligibility for a new innovator you may submit an r or other grant application after you submitted an application for a new innovator award you may an r or other grant subsequent to a new innovator award only it supports a different research project you may not have grants to support the same since i do not know if i will receive a new innovator award may apply for an r or other grant in the same area of research i know the outcome of this you may apply for an r or other grant while your new award application is pending however nih policy does not multiple submissions of the same or essentially the same you may either submit applications for two different concurrently or submit applications for essentially the project at different are individuals who have other outside sources of support you are eligible to apply for a new innovator award if you grant support from sources other than nih and have never been pi on any nih grants that would disqualify you as an early investigator however allowable grants will taken into consideration in review and funding especially if they support work closely related to this if i have a grant from an outside agency will i be able to as the principal investigator on this other grant support may be continued if the grant is for unrelated research project and if you are able to commit required percent of research effort to the new innovator if i received an rc rc or go grant am i still eligible apply for a new innovator no if you have received an rc rc go grant or a year with arra funds you are no longer considered an

was abandoned until started working on the constellation last decade and now that that project has been forgotten information is again beginning to gather dust if there is a point disconnect more in

policy registry will be a place for policymakers and open advocates easily share and update oer legislation oer institutional policies supporting oer policy resources we have begun to enter oer into the registry but we need your help to make it a truly global the open movement is reaching a stage where had some concrete oer policy victories and there is the potential achieve many more sharing our collective knowledge of existing policies in the same way we believe in sharing educational will help advocates and policymakers worldwide be more please join the contribute any oer policies you know about via this we are collecting both legislative and oer policies from around the world your submissions will be added to the draft list of oer review the draft list of oer policies google if any entries need to be fixed please email us pass on this call to your colleagues lists blogs and channels to ensure that we get as much input as possible as the movement is global it is critical that we capture oer policies around the anyone can add oer policies to the google form through the next beginning may the oer policy registry will move to the commons wiki at that point anyone will be able to edit and update oer policy registry on the wiki and all contributions will be under cc starting with a google form because a easy and b require you to create an account before editing and that may be barrier to cc is in contact with other projects that collect similar including unesco col the florida distance learning consortium eu and a project in new zealand we will add oer policy data they as

through different payzones fixed cutter product manager said the mechanical properties of the cutter are represented in the materials that expand at different rates when exposed to heat able to control that thermal mechanical piece of the cutter helps to keep the cutter from damaging itself under heat conditions key technology is the multilevel force which veers from what the industry has used in the past before the multilevel layout concept there was a general balancing across an entire cutting structure so that a transition one rock type to another was not as smooth the multilevel balancing ensures a balance between the transition periods as result the way the cutters are laid out on the profile of the bit balancing not only the whole cutting structure but in addition balancing the transition as those different cutter groups go the different formations mr dunbar alignright httpaddr httpaddr megaforce bit left and steelforce bit right both have enhanced to improve the flow of

does not ball up cuttings being able to get the fluid flow across the face of the where we need it is one big advantage mr dunbar coating is also applied to the steel through a treatment the outer layer of the steel turns the conductivity of the steel into a negative charge when you have mud and the particles in that mud are also negative start repelling each other he explained a of a water on

included as part of the process this involves feeding critical data such as pressure and flow rates provided by the iw system back into a management software to achieve an even workflow process that will operators to maximize every drop of growing for iw technology lies in extreme reservoir contact and reservoir contact wells in fields explained product line manager for intelligent completions the driver behind this and applications beyond the deepwater sector is recovery he said many the industry focus on production get it now get it faster but operators really pushing iw technologies the goal is to extract higher percentage of oil and gas from the reservoir than they were to do div a the past two years schlumberger has focused on technologies for multistage completions for a range offshore and land applications these include the development downhole wet mates for hydraulic and electric power and enabling deployment of iw systems in the lower zone that connect to surface when running the upper completion bandwidth have led schlumberger to develop technologies in subsea specific to iw systems enabling subsea integration that goes the standard subsea and controls have a that looks well into the future to determine what we need to both short and to bring value to customers and recovery up to a high level mr eck noted weve expanded the ability of these intelligent completion systems because often sensing was done above the iw systems now with some of the systems in the field we are looking to expand the sensing into laterals and the mother bore in combination

solutions for stabilizing wellbore to one of managing the payzone said production line manager intelligent well systems the benefits are significant in terms capital expenditure savings lower operating expenses and fewer drilled he said these systems can be controlled and remotely delivering solutions that help operators manage reservoirs and increase hughes deployed its inforce hydraulic intelligent well system including a marginal field that was discovered alongside a reservoir in the north sea the operator couldnt justify the cost dedicating another well to the smaller reservoir but rather than it unproduced drilled a multilateral well to intersect both with one well mr tirado said we knew this smaller reservoir produce water before the main one would so we used the system remotely isolate the problem zone so the operator could produce oil avoid an service companies are seeing migration from traditional hydraulic iws to systems with valves and components which baker hughes is developing the level functionality with electric systems is better than what we can with hydraulic systems but the economics are also different mr explained not every well can justify the cost of an electric which uses components borrowed from the aerospace hydraulic systems have multiple control lines through the wellhead so we need the infrastructure to control lines said baker hughes product director for intelligent production systems in wells with three five zones that is often not an issue but with the number of increasing to six zones and some design plans calling for to zones the number of hydraulic lines becomes an with electric completions we can run multiple valves off a line in this way some of the cost of installing an completion is offset by reducing the subsea

temperature sensing along the length of a well we can measure temperature at and increments along the length of the well and use that information determine where the flows are coming in he said during a frac we can use fiber optics to determine where the fluid is into the well so we know where the fracture is gauges such as the suresens provide accurate pressure temperature data for temperatures up

indicating that training of personnel and ensuring are followed must be a review of the data the olsdw is recommending that training continue to focus riggers with particular attention to the position

of their efforts sltg made numerous recommendations to three main groups trade associations and regulators among recommendations to trade association group was to update api rp d and that this update directed toward rigger training lift planning and job safety the april macondo incident the industry landscape has changed significantly the mms is no longer regulatory agency and the issue of lifting operations now falls the jurisdiction of bsee and the uscg bsee has also implemented safety and environmental management systems sems program which addresses some of the issues identified by the sltg

to lift planning jsas temporary cranes and offshore vessel osv lifting that meeting there been numerous meetings of the main committee to review and discuss work of the subcommittees on their

awards are the largest and the competition is fierce proposals i often find myself working on involve healthcare which means coordinating between multiple entities such community clinics fqhcs hospitals and community based a substantial funding pie was divided into slices month as the cms innovation center created as part of the care act announced the awardees for the billion challenge competition the program was well received by the healthcare community involved with medicare and especially services approximately proposals were received in a very day window between november and january during the holidays of the year a challenge the ambitious timetable processing and evaluating the avalanche of proposals in march predictably extended another days seventeen california comprised the largest number of awardees among the states rico and one site not geographically defined massachusetts and york were next with awards an essential step in the grantsmanship process is to analyze how were funded especially when your proposal is not funded we know odds of winning for the entire pool were however with all awards coming to our home state we wonder what the odds were california the cms team provided comments by the evaluation group reviewed our proposal which were helpful we learned our financial was just fine the financial plan had presented the challenge to our team as specific formats were required that novel albeit logical calculations ie cost per beneficiary i have prepared the following analysis of awards made in using my own metrics for what i consider important congratulations the budget the foa suggested budgets no smaller than and not than in total over three years our proposal requested support compared to the ca awards our budget was th largest average budget was the median was eight of the awardees were budgeted above savings vs expenses the challenge in the innovation challenge was propose a project that would increase medicaid enrollments increasing medicaid spending the net effect would be to the million new medicaid enrollees in without breaking bank note that this post precedes the pending supreme court regarding the affordable care act editorial moment it is opinion that the ruling will not alter the course towards universal coverage of all citizens therefore projects proposed under this innovation challenge are here to the review committees compared the expected savings to the stated the requested it seems clear the review committees wanted see plenty of savings for each dollar spent the savings to ratio for our proposal was which was th smallest the savings ratio was or approximately in savings for dollar requested in support this incredible figure was proposed by proposal that will create new hires and train workers the ca proposal most similar to our own in terms of which was funded had the nd highest savings ratio at average was and the median was six awardees proposed return or greater for every spent five of those six budgeted more than new hires the first item under the foa section titled key for the proposal to be prepared was workforce deployment deployment we rated jobs creation a high priority we proposed create new hires which placed our proposal th among ca the largest number of new hires was the average number of hires was the median for new hires was cost per hire we thought this figure would be important to reviewers our cost per hire was which was in the middle the pack the median was trainees we considered trainees to be secondary to new hires proposal to train currently hired community health workers was to the bottom ranking th the proposal with the largest number projected trainees was an impressive also by a consortium that included california the average was the was a statewide multiple partner group including seiu and la will train workers without creating any new the innovation challenge is a good initiative it addresses challenges that threaten to collapse our system we expect similar initiatives will be forthcoming no matter election outcomes our healthcare system is that severely one of the benefits in preparing a proposal like this is the likelihood that project features will be recycled in projects our consortium of community clinics and three proposed to train a new cohort of community health workers to work current and enrollees among the principle was to reduce visits to emergency departments for illnesses a change that must take place a unique feature in proposal was that we actually created a curriculum that could offered through a california state campus to certify the new reduction of costly and needless ed visits is not going away soon training people from the community in standard ways to patients

advised in the opinion of the committee cab was too caught up in professional issues the cab was to respond to the background paper click acupuncture board background paper trunc which is worthwhile read for those interested in california acupuncture or the legislative oversight process the very brief minute ended with the committee letting the cab chair and executive know the committee was concerned about how the board what are the substantive issues that led the committee to send warning shot across the cab the cab does not function well because it does not use the it has to function independently and responsibly the committee ten issues in the background paper in the march hearing the and executive director offered little explanation the cab now respond to the background paper in if there is one particular criticism that becomes clear upon a few cab meetings it is that the cab fails to uphold its despite the mission being fairly the mission of the acupuncture board is to benefit educate protect the public through regulation of licensure development education standards provision of consumer information enforcement of the acupuncture licensure one of the most important cab functions is to approve training programs so that their graduates are permitted to sit for california acupuncture licensing exam cale the cab has approximately schools including located in california the rarely removes a training program from its approved list which growing despite very strong evidence that many of the approved are doing a terrible job preparing graduates to pass the cale are at least seven schools with less than half their graduates able pass the cale four of these programs have pass rates below might conclude the cab is more interested in approving schools realizing the cab vision which includes ensuring excellence practitioner training and why cale pass rates matter the rate at which graduates of a program pass the licensing exam is the first and foremost indicator the quality of their training most healthcare professions physical therapy nursing physician assistant and physician have rates above even licensed vocational nurses pass at a rate than the average pass rate for acupuncturists on the cale across decade and was ed these data are from the a pass rate this low means passing the licensing exam almost the same as flipping a there are only a few explanations for a pass rate this low the exam too hard the exam is poorly constructed eg it is does not what people study or the people taking the exam are simply not prepared the cab has had testimony from the own department that there is noting wrong with the cale as a tool the test is not irrelevant although some might argue cale not test enough conventional medicine the test is not too certain groups historically perform much better than other groups pointed out in the background paper pg that leaves conclusion many graduates as in on average are prepared that leads to only one other conclusion some schools do actually exist to train different conclusions would merit consideration if the evidence academic failure among so many training programs was short term it not here is the real question with so much strong evidence in hands why has the cab failed to take any action to protect the by doing a better job at ensuring the quality of training by at least the worst performing schools from its the cab approves schools that have testified to the cab they are not the business of training acupuncturists in one school testified that he expected his graduates would work as despite being visibly alarmed the chair voted with the other members to approve the school provisionally for three years while school clearly should not have been approved the idea of provisional approval is a good one that should form the basis of a the senate committee on business professions and economic appears to be ready to replace the cale with the national exam nccaom and remove the school oversight function deferring to the national certification body these are bad ideas because they simply kick the problem outside the state and nccaom serve the very schools that are problems in our state the cab wants to avoid the removal of their licensing and functions then the cab has to begin functioning according to mission and initiate a program that uses cale data to guide its approval in responding to the background paper the cab should recommend following new policy for evaluating currently approved schools and schools that are applying for all new schools seeking approval must meet new criteria to drafted by a qualified health professions educator experienced mainstream new schools can only receive approval for no more than three years the school must achieve a pass rate by year two and maintain it in year all currently approved schools must achieve a pass rate training programs that do not hit these marks should be removed the there is one more issue the number of graduates from any school actually sit for the cale the cab should require that each school its approved list must annually report the total number of and the number of graduates that took the cale each year the of graduates who take the exam should be any school with fewer than of its graduates who register and take the cale should be placed on one year probation to the standard if that standard is not met then that school should removed from the list of cab approved schools the school reapply after five years and significant the cab does not function well because it does not use its information available on its own website to function and responsibly the background paper covers other issues board approval of continuing education courses clearly not aligned acupuncture and scope of practice questions in previous sunset years eg and the cab has repeated explanations if the cab repeats this strategy once again it result in a significant loss of authority which would not

http://www.duke.edu/web/kenanethics/WayneNorman_RecognizingBusinessEthics.doc business and ethical challenges in awarding prizes for good corporate norman phd duke roux msc mcgill ma de seems to be a proliferation of prizes and rankings for ethical business over the past decade our principal aims in this article are to initiate an academic discussion of the epistemic and normative stakes in competitions and to help organizers of such competitions to think through some of these issues and the design options for dealing with them we have been able to find no substantive literature academic or otherwise that addresses either of these two broad topics and audiences our modest aim therefore is to suggest an agenda of issues and to begin to explore and analyze some of the possible arguments for and against various philosophical or practical solutions part i explores the challenges facing a committee including problems derived from what rawls calls the of in democratic societies reasonable people will always disagree over some basic values including those relevant to evaluating business practices and epistemic issues about how we can justify qualitative judgments on the basis of incomplete quantitative data we also try to identify risks and opportunity costs for granters in part ii we spell out a a range of design options and b some advice about how any particular committee might select among these options to best achieve its goals which typically involve highlighting and publicizing best practices for ethical and academics who specialize in business ethics know the drill they open the newspaper to see details of an emerging corporate scandal typically involving illegal activities and within a day or so the telephone rings and a journalist is on the line seeking an expert opinion on the of the firm at the heart of the scandal if there are two or three such scandals in quick succession the journalist may want an opinion on whether or why we are witnessing a general decline in business ethics more often than not the expert has very little to add to such stories the company or one of its managers broke the law the law had been put in place precisely to serve as a disincentive to engage in activities with particular types of ethically negative consequences the company or its agents knowingly or negligently went ahead with the dubious activities there is often little of interest that an ethicist can contribute here although journalists are obviously happy to be able to transmit some expert as bob dylan famously put it need a weatherman to know which way the wind you need an ethicist to tell you that fraud or theft or lying or poisoning people is unethical would be much more interesting for business ethicists to receive a different kind of call from journalists from time to time for example about a difficult dilemma faced by a business where it is not at all obvious what the most ethical solution is or to get to the point of this article many business ethicists would be delighted to comment on the innovative ethically practices of certain firms but these calls rarely come the net effect is that news is almost always bad news and one consequence of this is that it reinforces a perception of business and business leaders as fundamentally unethical checked only by the countervailing power of state regulations auditors police investigative journalists whistleblowers and heroic ngos goes without saying that many within the business community strongly dispute the reality of this perception and this is surely the major source of motivation behind many initiatives to develop prizes and awards for business ethics corporate citizenship corporate social responsibility and the like magazine features that attempt to rank the most ethical businesses or credible prizes for ethical businesses that are awarded in public ceremonies generate good news about business ethics moreover they may do so in ways that suggest that ethical practices are much more widespread than a typical citizen is usually led to believe it does seem that at least in north america there are now a growing number of such prizes and rankings although local chapters of the chamber of commerce and the better business bureau in the usa and canada have long given out prizes in recognition of ethical businesses and business people there are a number of new prizes and rankings over the last five or ten years including the initiation of rankings for ethical business or corporate citizenship by business ethics magazine now called cro magazine in the us the globe and report on business magazine and corporate knights magazine in canada as well as the observer newspaper in the the assumption that many organizations and publications may be currently contemplating initiating new prizes or rankings for ethical business we believe it is worth exploring some of the options and challenges for conducting a legitimate comparative evaluation of this sort to date there appears to be no existing literature academic or practical to guide the deliberations of a team trying to design a prize competition these competitions can involve potentially significant costs to both the organizers and the candidate firms as well as certain risks there are also a number of difficult philosophical challenges to address whenever one attempts to quantify or rank the kinds of qualitative achievements that constitute a ethical in part i of this paper we will survey the objectives benefits costs risks and other issues that make up the for a prize in business ethics and in part ii we will discuss a number of the design options for a legitimate prize competition of the rest of this article will be written to address directly the concerns of a committee exploring the possibility of setting up a prize or a ranking for ethical businesses most of the issues with rankings eg listing the top and prizes are similar and so for the sake of brevity we shall often talk only of prizes except in cases where the issues facing prizes and rankings are different this is not intended simply as a guide however we believe that the question of how to evaluate rank recognize and celebrate corporate social performance is a legitimate and neglected domain of research in the course of presenting issues and options for practical purposes we also hope to highlight more philosophical issues worthy of future research i thinking through the designing anything it helps to be clear about what it is for we shall assume that most organizations or publications setting out to design a prize or ranking for ethical business will have one or more of the following objectives in recognize and celebrate the good deeds or innovative practices of particular businesses or individual business publicize in hopes that they will spread provide a mild incentive for businesses to adopt policies and practices that may qualify them for recognition as an ethical firm or improve their ranking in the case of annual counter misconceptions about the business community in general based on the reporting bias that tends to highlight unethical other lists of options to follow we do not presume that this list is there may be other reasons for awarding an ethics prize to give an extreme example there are various prizes and lists currently available that publicize unethical businesses and part of their objective no doubt is to inspire protests against these firms and perhaps against private business or capitalism more it is not our aim to evaluate this particular list of objectives as such assuming they are pursued in good faith these are fairly uncontroversial and worthy objectives our reason for highlighting such a list at the outset is that depending on the weight given to each such objective or others some ways of designing and conducting the prize competition may do a better or worse job at achieving its aims it is also important given the costs and risks we will discuss presently for a committee contemplating the creation of a prize to think about whether there are other more effective or efficient ways of achieving these goals for example a magazine might decide that it can promote ethical business practices more efficiently simply by identifying a few admirable companies and publishing features on their innovations and are assuming that a committee contemplating the awarding of an ethics prize will itself take this responsibility ethically that is that it will aim to identify and award the most worthy candidates and that it will base its evaluations on adequate information and expertise this already raises the question of costs since much of the relevant information may not be readily available in general a organization could contemplate incurring or invoking costs such as the of publicizing the upcoming competition such as advertising and media relations building and maintaining a web site distributing nomination forms or information possibly identifying and contacting candidate firms to nominators to provide detailed information about their operations this process can be so costly that many organizations limit the number of rankings or prizes they will submit themselves for each to the organizers to verify at least some of this information and to conduct additional background searches of candidate firms or finalists eg to uncover pending law suits or existing legal or regulatory to organizers to process and evaluate applications handle queries secure meeting space arrange for and possibly pay for experts jury members and to publicize winners organize ceremonies prize or ranking that is taken seriously by the competing organizations and that makes objective criteria public runs the risk of creating perverse incentives for potential candidates to make investments in areas that will increase their chances of winning even in cases where these might not the best ways to achieve the results that are really being prized so to in addition to these more or less direct costs to prize organizers candidates and others who volunteer their time there are numerous risks that these parties assume some of which could eventually bear significant or perceived flaws or bias in the nomination or evaluation process could damage the reputation of the awarding organization and also lead to some embarrassment to winning firms whose prizes will seem questioning of the worthiness of winners especially from dubious conduct occurring or being revealed after the fact could discredit the this kind of controversy could also fuel the very sort of cynicism about business that a prize competition is trying to firms may be reluctant even to allow themselves to be nominated fearing the label ethical could make them a target for muckraking journalists or these obvious costs and risks including opportunity costs it is by no means obvious that a prize competition in business ethics will achieve the desired objectives or at least that it will achieve them better than some less costly or risky alternative such a competition could end up being a relatively expensive way of obtaining a small amount of publicity for ethical business practices and at worst it could backfire in ways that punish genuinely ethical business initiatives and tarnish further the reputation of private enterprise more generally or to put it more positively the challenge for organizers of such a competition is to design a process that will minimize some of the worst risks although such a process may well involve greater costs and to maximize the publicity and educational effects will return to options for the design and methodology of an ethics prize competition in part ii below first though we will finish this section on the challenges facing organizers of an ethics prize by looking at some of the more philosophical and ethical issues at and ethical are two different kinds of ethical challenges that a committee organizing an ethics prize will face first there are issues concerning the ethics if you will of its own operations and processes and secondly there are theoretical and philosophical issues about what ultimately are the most justifiable ways of evaluating and comparing the ethical performance of different firms here are some examples of these two very different sorts of ethical issues in reverse order issues in ethical theory and issues in ethical are several overlapping ways we might sum up the general challenge for ranking the ethical practices of different firms some of which invoke some of the deepest most intractable issues in ethical are a plurality of basic values and principles and reasonable people can disagree about which ones are more important or fundamental in any given situation john rawls famously refers to this as fact of something that must be taken into account by any adequate theory of justice or social responsibility in a democratic fact of pluralism is illustrated in the way critics of and apologists for modern business emphasize different objectives for ethical or socially responsible business at the extreme some critics will evaluate businesses largely in terms of their impact on the environment while many business leaders will emphasize minimizing fraud by employees and fulfilling fiduciary duties to these two observations a organization seeking broad legitimacy and acceptance of its judgments will have to try to reconcile what are perhaps irreconcilable normative perspectives when it evaluates candidate can also observe that it is fundamentally unclear how we can quantify levels of ethical or unethical conduct if a person keeps the next three promises but tells one lie has her increased or decreased if a firms donates dollars to a worthy charity but is caught dumping toxic waste is this a net positive or net negative ethical performance if these questions sound absurd or impossible to answer objectively it may be because of this basic difficulty quantifying qualitative ethical evaluations see norman and macdonald and if we have difficulty quantifying one ethical performance it will be that much harder to compare the ethics of multiple might also note the epistemic difficulty for any committee external to a firm or even for to gather all the information that is necessary for an informed evaluation for some vanguard firms that have over the past decade or so been submitting themselves to internal and external social auditing or bottom accounting this process can take a full year and involve significant corporate resources including employees engaged in stakeholder relations and obviously no organization can conduct such an audit of all candidate could easily extend this list of basic issues in the justification of ethical judgments that are alive and directly relevant to the comparative evaluation of businesses but these points already lay out some daunting challenges that earnest must somehow attempt to negotiate in addition as noted like any organization they will have to be scrupulous about their own ethics and perceptions thereof consider just two of the more likely ethical are general questions about fairness including questions of whether the conceptions and criteria for ethical business incorporate a broad range of perspectives for example the perspectives of different types of stakeholders such as investors bankers consumers employees or union members perceptions of fairness in the competition will also be influenced by the selection of particular judges and whether they reflect a range of differing perspectives about ethical there could be general and specific questions of bias on the part of committee organizers or judges including potential conflicts of interests if firms close to these individuals are also candidates for the prize these potential concerns presumably require clear and transparent procedures for dealing with conflicts of of these truncated lists of issues give us an indication of the urgency of the design challenge for anyone wishing to create a prize or an annual ranking for ethical businesses a badly designed prize competition could do more harm than good we will now turn to some of the specific options for designing competitions and evaluation methodologies ii thinking through the survey of design options for a business ethics ranking or prize competition is based in part on an examination of the criteria and methodologies used by a number of existing competitions again see the appendix for a partial list of existing in other words most of the options we will discuss have actually been used by existing prize competitions or rankings although we have also supplemented the of design options with certain innovations we have not yet found in practice we make no claim to having surveyed every competition many of these are local or regional with a particular city state or province and most do not provide detailed information on their rules processes or methods our aim in this article is to initiate an academic discussion of prize competitions with a fairly comprehensive set of parameters we welcome future research on the merits of various design options as well as on some of the deeper philosophical issues of the sort raised in part rest of part ii will discuss some of the advantages and disadvantages of options under the following prize in criteria for eligibility or to collect verify and evaluate to publicize prize in have so far discussed vaguely the idea of a prize for or business ethics we all have some idea what it means to be an ethical business especially in contrast to businesses that seem plainly unethical for example businesses that break or bend rules and laws in the pursuit of profit or personal enrichment paying no heed to the consequences of their activities for other stakeholders especially when these gains are derived almost entirely from exploiting market still it is not at all clear what terminology or normative category should be used to describe the kind of prize or competition more precisely it is not at all obvious that the organizers should want to give out a prize in or for the ethical there are at least two reasons why they may hesitate to use this terminology first the term has for many people a more limited connotation relating primarily to the virtues of individuals and their actions eg about whether an individual is honest courageous treats others with respect steal etc they necessarily think of as a category that takes into account all of the positive social and environmental contributions a firm may be responsible for and second many potential recipients may be somewhat embarrassed and even apprehensive about being awarded a prize for being most firm or business person it sounds pretentious and perhaps a little and as we noted already it may draw the attention of muckraking critics eager to expose any example of conduct in the ethical both of these reasons for eschewing the language of per se it is not surprising that many of the prizes and rankings have in fact adopted other terminology even business ethics magazine in its annual ranking of firms claimed to rank them in terms of their as does corporate knights magazine and new prix de citoyenne in quebec similarly the ethics in action organization an ngo in british columbia canada that is financed by some corporations gives out annual prizes not for ethics but for and the us chamber of commerce also chooses to give awards with specific prizes for and opting for the language of business ethics are not unheard of eg the better business bureau gives out awards in both the us and internationally for but they seem to be in the minority in any case we simply want to underline here that the choice of terminology is an important consideration in the overall design of a competition of this sort and one that is not merely a question of semantics or political correctness it is a way to manage some of the risks mentioned in part i as well as to reduce some of the potential philosophical controversies associated with broad and controversial ethical categories for the sake of brevity we will continue using the language of here though it should be understood that this covers the broad range of normative categories discussed in this subsection among choice about what exactly to award the prize for concerns the choice between recognizing the overall performance of a business on the one hand and one or more of a practices acts or policies on the other this choice has implications for many of the other decisions about the process and the methodology and it can also be considered a crucial juncture in the attempt to manage some of the costs risks as well as some of the philosophical challenges raised in part i put quite simply it is easier in many ways to evaluate and compare some individual practices of different firms that it is to evaluate the ethical performance of a firm and to compare this to other firms evaluating single practices eliminates many but not all of the philosophical concerns about global evaluations of a firm eg balancing charitable donations and dumping and it also reduces the costs and risks for firms that are participating in the competition they are being recognized for particular innovations so they do not have to submit information on a wide range of their activities and they will not have to carry around the burden of being considered the company similarly the organizers of the prize reduce some of their own risks that would come with awarding a prize for ethical to a company that is later shown to have unethical skeletons in its closet a company could be recognized for certain ethical practices even if it was less than perfect in other domains prizes for specific innovative practices might also help achieve some of the ultimate objectives of the competition better for example it may provide the press with more or achievements to describe and in publicizing the innovations of both nominees and winners some very valuable information about best practices can be widely disseminated and adopted by other firms there can be something a little about simply listing a number of firms that are admired but perhaps for nothing in particular given all of these potential advantages to recognizing specific practices rather than performance it is interesting that so few of the existing we have studied has opted for this criteria for eligibility or even the smallest jurisdictions in which an ethics prize might be awarded there will be literally thousands of firms consider the yellow pages or the section listing businesses in even a telephone book it would be practically impossible to put it mildly for any organization to conduct an ethical evaluation of all of these firms it will need to develop some criteria for eligibility and nomination research of existing competitions has not uncovered criteria for eligibility that explicitly exclude firms apart from standard geographical or size requirements in principle organizers could decide to exclude any firm that has been convicted for violating laws or regulations in say the previous five years or like some firms offering they could in principle exclude firms in certain sectors such as tobacco gambling firearms etc but such screening may not be considered urgent as an qualification since any such information could also be weighed in the evaluation process more typical way to entrants is simply to provide for different awards or rankings for businesses of different sizes small medium large as measured by revenues or employees or different sectors there are numerous obvious reasons for giving out multiple prizes in smaller categories like this we might point out that so doing also helps resolve at least some of the philosophical challenges we raised in part i concerning intractable disputes derived from the plurality of values in democratic society imagine an ethics competition in which a jury was asked to consider two finalists one being a large international petrochemical firm that has undertaken a mission and the other being a small organic food store it is hard to imagine that they would really be using the same ethical categories or criteria for evaluating these two kinds of firms even the metaphor seems inadequate to describe the difference between the normative challenges faced by the managers of these two kinds of firms by allowing them to compete in different categories by size or sector it is more likely that they will be compared more objectively to firms of a similar type and dealing with similar challenges possibility for reducing the potential divergence of ethical categories of relevance to different achievements is to give out different awards for practices and innovations pertaining to different stakeholder groups in this way for example an organization could give out different awards for firms that excelled in the treatment respectively of their employees customers suppliers shareholders local communities or the environment more generally now as we have just seen some of the awards that we have surveyed do focus on more specific stakeholder relations like this and moreover there are numerous prizes and rankings that do not even present themselves as that focus directly on employee relations industrial relations governance environmental management customer satisfaction etc again for our purposes here we simply want to underline that comparative evaluations within relatively specific categories can a reduce the divergence of normative criteria b enable the specification of more and transparent criteria and thereby c lower the likelihood that the judging process will be seen as arbitrary or is also a question of how firms will be nominated to be considered for the prize there are three general possibilities all of which we see among the existing firms of a specific type could be automatically considered whether they want to be or for example it could be the largest n firms from a particular stock exchange or the n largest firms within a specified geographical or political region such as the admired category among the fortune this option is typically used by magazines that rank could solicit nominations at large firms could nominate themselves or be nominated by others or both this will generally lower the total number of candidates especially if the nomination process is somewhat onerous eg with multiple nominating letters or the agreement of the nominated themselves could undertake to nominate or solicit the participation of firms or similarly they could create a fairly large panel of experts or interested parties or conduct an opinion poll of some kind in order to identify candidate combination of the latter two or even of all three methods is possible the choice of method used has implications for how organizers will cope with some of the challenges we raised in part i as well as with their choice of some of the other design options we are discussing here in part ii obviously an important issue concerns how many firms an organization could reasonably expect to evaluate given its resources a nomination process must be chosen in part as a way of limiting the number of candidates the question of whether participation is voluntary will also directly affect the quantity and quality of information that the judges will have at their disposal if firms nominate themselves or agree to be nominated they can reasonably be expected to provide detailed information of a sort that they are not normally required to divulge but if they are being ranked without their prior consent judges may have to stick to publicly available data which is generally quite limited especially for firms not listed on public stock exchanges voluntary participation would also permit firms to avoid the competition if they feared that the glory of being considered the most ethical might not outweigh the risk of being targeted by critics who would like to expose them as hypocrites and in the case of firms that might actually fear they have in their such a withdrawal might also save the awarding organization from the embarrassment of giving an award to a firm just before it is exposed for to collect verify and evaluate we noted in part i a large part of the cost of conducting a prize competition in business ethics for both the organizers and the nominated firms involves the collection and evaluation of data we have also seen the ways in which a thorough collection of relevant data can go a long way to reducing the risks that emerge when journalists or the public can plausibly doubt the objectivity of the process decisions about the collection and the evaluation of the data are intimately linked if final decisions are going to be made by a panel of judges certain kinds of data say from testimonials and interviews may be appropriate whereas if winners or rankings are going to be determined via the data alone with various normatively determined weighting methods and so on then data that are directly quantifiable will be much good data an organization can gather is a function largely of the total budget and of the number of candidates or finalists the quicker a shortlist can be developed perhaps on the basis of some general and comparable information the more resources can be devoted to gaining a clearer picture of the of a smaller number of finalists the existing prize competitions and rankings that we have studied we see a broad range of often creative techniques for gathering data on firms the most rigorous analyses use multiple and overlapping sources of information the first question that arises for a organization is the we undertake to gather the information we outsource the to a research firm we do we do some combination of and obvious reasons the choice among these three options and more particularly the choice to rely heavily on outsourced research will have an impact on some of the risks involved in the entire process roughly speaking the legitimacy of the process will depend to some degree on the perceived objectivity and integrity of the research regardless of the choice made among these three options both and researchers will have to gather information from the following sorts of primary from the firms themselves typically through testimonial letters or documents or from the firms themselves through publicly available reports such as annual reports of financial and some public sources information typically from various government departments such as records of criminal allegations fines law suits reports from regulatory agencies lobby registries public or proprietary sources of information typically from organizations private research and ratings firms firms press reviews some of these data will be as and reliable as official sources of information but some of it may be questionable or spotty given the limited resources of such research nomination letters and testimonials from individuals outside the contending opinion polls of the general public or perhaps of a selected large group eg business journalists ceos chief ethics and compliance officers the memories and opinions of members of a jury if there is one who are charged with making the final comparative judgments among finalists that is jury members may have certain views about some of the firms or even the types of firms in the competition and we cannot ignore the impact these views can have on the eventual goes without saying that virtually every prize or ranking competition in business ethics will use information drawn from more than one of these sources we shall not discuss here the strengths and weaknesses of each of these sources of information or how much each one would cost and how relying on them would augment or reduce risks it seems like a comprehensive assessment of this sort is worthy of at least one whole article on its own at the risk of belaboring the obvious however we would like to add a few observations about the challenges faced by an organizing committee trying to choose among these sources of information most general piece of advice here is best illustrated by the old parable of the drunk scanning the pavement beneath a street lamp a passerby asks him what looking for responds the drunk hopefully not his car keys did you drop asks the passerby over motions the drunk in the direction of a dark area beyond the light from the streetlamp looking here because this is where the light its attempt to discover which companies are most deserving of an award the committee will sometimes have to choose between objective information that is of only limited relevance to an ethical evaluation of a firm the equivalent of the information exposed by the streetlamp or somewhat less clear or less reliable information that is nevertheless more directly pertinent like the information gathered by feeling around the pavement in the dark on hands and knees in the general area where the keys as rawls used to note in his lectures at harvard when talking about the basic inputs for ethical judgment it is better to be vaguely right than precisely wrong of course there are numerous sources of information that are both reliably objective and directly pertinent although even then sometimes such information may be available for only some of the firms in the other things equal more information from more sources is better but more information sometimes adds to controversy rather than eliminating it more information from more sources often presents evaluators with inconsistencies and even contradictions not to mention for which there are no set algorithms consider the very public debates over the of where supporters and critics put forward impressive evidence for very different conclusions about say impact on employment or and even when there is agreement on some of these data there remain deep divisions over questions like how we evaluate the overall impact of the introduction of a new store in a region if say it increases the purchasing power for poor families by but also reduces the total number of jobs by our research we have found that rankings in magazines and elsewhere tend to err somewhat on the side of the so to speak they tend to use more publicly available quantifiable data that can be found for all of the firms in their survey eg the percentage of net income given to it is unfortunate if this requires leaving out potentially useful data that is not available for all firms or is not as reliable or quantifiable such reliance on under the street at least allows them to conduct similar ranking exercises in successive years which may show progress and regress for certain firms and its very may protect the organizers from accusations of bias one of the risks of relying on such a however is that sometimes firms that are widely perceived as unscrupulous or otherwise ethically dubious might actually find themselves ranking well on the basis of the objective data and this can cast doubt on the whole ranking exercise if not actually subject it to the other end of the spectrum many prizes use multiple sources of often incomplete and even inconsistent information and rely on juries of experts to balance it intuitively such a process is less likely to anoint controversial or winners but for obvious reasons is also always open to accusations of ideological or personal bias such accusation may best be countered by a combination of transparency about the judges and their presumably respectable and noteworthy backgrounds on the one hand and a commitment to a diverse jury with members drawn from different stakeholder groups types of organizations cultural communities and points on the ideological spectrum etc on the to publicize part i we began by noting the ultimate objectives that most committees will have when deciding to organize a prize in business ethics objectives like recognition for vanguard firms and promotion of their innovative best practices as well as some good press in general for a business community which may be more used to tales of scandals very few of these objectives can be met no matter how rigorous the processes already discussed in part ii if there is not adequate publicity of winners and their is not our place here to give advice on this kind of marketing and public relations exercise but for the sake of laying out a comprehensive set of design options we can report that three modes of publicizing and celebrating winners are common among existing prizes with all three being used in some media sources with a interviews a banquet or reception with finalists sponsoring organizations media etc in the hall often to unveil the winners among the with a newspaper or magazine to produce a feature on the finalists and winners in some cases magazines themselves undertake to organize their own contests typically in the form of addition to considering which of these methods of publicizing and celebrating will have the most impact organizers can take advantage of this final stage to further legitimize their processes through principal aims in this article are to initiate an academic discussion of the epistemic and normative stakes in competitions and to help organizers of such competitions to think through some of these issues and the design options for dealing with them it goes without saying that an initial survey of these numerous topics can barely scratch the surface on the practical side deeper discussion and debate must take place among organizing committees to meet some of the challenges we have underscored in ways that are consistent with their goals values and we must not forget budgets our most general conclusion for practitioners is that a there are significant costs and risks involved in awarding prizes and the opportunity costs may well be higher than other means of achieving similar goals but b these opportunity costs are not insurmountable and a prize competition does hold significant promise as a way to celebrate publicize and diffuse ethically innovative business practices and managerial there has been virtually no academic discussion of prizes and rankings in business ethics per se it must be said that there has been considerable debate over many of the most problematic underlying issues facing competition designers there are at least two types of core problem first a tremendous amount of information about each firm would be necessary to make an informed judgment about its level of ethics social responsibility or corporate citizenship again one has only to look at the amount of resources and time that individual firms spend in order to gather information for their own social and environmental audits no organization will ever have anything close to this amount of information on all the firms even on its shortlist so it will necessarily be making comparative evaluations on the basis of very incomplete information in addition and this is the second type of fundamental problem we want to highlight here even with a vast amount of potentially relevant information about a firm there does not exist any agreed upon method for aggregating these data to arrive at something like an bottom even the major agencies and firms promoting social and environmental auditing or accounting have not dared to propose an actual aggregative methodology that parallels the ones in financial some ratings firms of various sorts as well as some rankings in magazines have developed very specific ways of weighting a relatively small number of data on firms in order to come up with cardinal scores and ordinal rankings such scoring systems might for example give a firm points for each percentage of its net profits it donates to charity or for each women or member of a it has on its board and so but such weightings will always be controversial given the of underlined by rawls as we noted earlier debates about whether or not is for show how reasonable people can quite reasonably attach different levels of importance to different levels of attention to the interests of different stakeholder groups we would not argue at this point that mechanical weighting systems must absolutely be eschewed in evaluation methodologies of a prize competition but such methodologies do generally risk producing results that are exactly wrong so to speak rather than vaguely right this is clearly an issue worthy of more detailed academic short the challenges of gathering relevant information and of these numbers to arrive at robust uncontroversial bottom are formidable in business ethics and in ethical theory more general no organization is going to definitively solve these problems nor should it have to try to this suggests that a realistic committee will to some extent have to try to maintain its legitimacy while nevertheless giving up on any illusions of objectively and uncontroversially identifying winners rather when designing its methods and processes as well as in its communications to the public and to participating firms it should keep its eyes on its ultimate objectives for the exercise typically these objectives are recognitional but more importantly educational it is trying to educate the business community at large on the best practices of ethical management and the general public on the commitments of many within the business community to do good while doing well in the course of this article we have suggested a number of ways organizers can avoid pitfalls that stand in the way of achieving this goal r d nitkin k otto p

httpaddr httpaddr and remarks in the above table are based on information that is readily available from public documents and websites so comments about whether methods are transparent or criteria are clear for example are based on this information alone these things may be more transparent or clear for those who deal directly with organization running the prize or note this was originally published online in the journal of business ethics on july at hyperlink httpaddr httpaddr springer the is available at httpaddr see the appendix for a list of a number of the prizes and rankings we have been tracking in addition we should note there are many firms that collect statistics to gauge social responsibility or ethical fitness some of which are contracted by the organizations for example here are the explicit of the awards given by a ethics in action year we celebrate businesses and business leaders who are building new corporate models organizations and individuals who exemplify good corporate citizenship by making corporate social responsibility a key aspect of their daily and b the better business bureau torch award is designed to promote not only the importance of ethical business practices but the willingness and efforts made by outstanding businesses to ensure that our marketplace remains fair and honorable for all consider another possible objective an organization or corporation may decide to create and award an ethics prize as a way of enhancing its own brand or reputation indeed this may almost always be part of the motivation for creating a prize and as such it is likely to figure into how the organization thinks about certain issues we shall raise for example there is the worst ranked by the multinational monitor latest issue or hyperlink httpaddr httpaddr and the worst corporate ranked by corpwatch hyperlink httpaddr httpaddr there are also many organizations that check the of corporations ethical consumer uk hyperlink httpaddr httpaddr corpwatch us hyperlink httpaddr httpaddr and uk hyperlink httpaddr httpaddr knowmore us hyperlink httpaddr httpaddr consider the following hypothetic example of a prize competition creating a perverse incentive imagine a social ranking methodology that gives points for a firm providing day care for the children of employees but not for say paying employees to perform charity work per month now imagine say a small biotech firm with relatively wealthy employees who can afford daycare that might decide to cancel its policy of paying employees to do charity work once a month in order to fund a new employee daycare this might plausibly result in a less socially responsible firm but one that would then rank higher in the competition surely the reputation of cfo magazine took a hit for having awarded andrew fastow a excellence for capital structure management in less than two years before that capital structure management would lead to one of the greatest collapses and scandals in american corporate history to its credit cfo magazine has kept the embarrassing evidence on its website hyperlink httpaddr httpaddr as rawls puts it modern democratic society is characterized not simply by a pluralism of comprehensive religious philosophical and moral doctrines but by a pluralism of incompatible yet reasonable comprehensive doctrines no one of these doctrines is affirmed by citizens generally nor should one expect that in the foreseeable future one of will ever be affirmed by all or nearly all rawls xvi our italics the most eloquent description of this fundamental incompatibility of basic values that is the fact that we must always be willing to make sacrifice some values for others in our designs of political institutions and projects is still to be found in isaiah inaugural lecture from concepts of berlin esp see eg the survey of the opinions of ceos in the us southeast region by the rutland institute for ethics hyperlink httpaddr httpaddr indeed organizational functions may actually have little knowledge expertise or experience of many of those ethical issues which affect its crane for excellent analyses of many of the first generation of exercises in the s see zadek pruzan and evans for an excellent discussion of what is ethically problematic about exploiting market failures such as information asymmetries or negative externalities like pollution see heath the annual list of the best corporate produced by business ethics magazine is a perennial target for critics who object to the presence of large corporations with records see for example riposte in hyperlink httpaddr httpaddr two regional prizes in canada emphasize specific ethical innovations or practices rather than overall evaluations the aforementioned prix de citoyenne in quebec which does this quite explicitly and the ethics in action awards in british columbia which emphasize subcategories favouring particular bold there is significant variation among the prizes we studied regarding the transparency of their methodologies understandably some organizations may feel that their system is proprietary additionally other organizations contract with firms that refuse to reveal their metrics it is important to note that there are two major problems that can be encountered with the use of questionnaires first there is a social desirability bias of the main problems for investigators that utilise methods which require direct responses from research subjects concerning morality is the possibility of encountering social desirability bias when asked the question your company or your company there are few executives that would tick the crane second there is also the factor caused by the large number of questionnaires that companies have to fill out for various reasons maitland for example corporate knights magazine which is one of the more transparent players in the ranking game includes the following sources of information in their citizen public filings federal lobby registry pollution watch national pollutant release inventory shareholder association for research and education human resources and skills development canada a federal agency standard tax justice network and the us environmental protection agency on the other hand the globe and report on business magazine and the business ethics now cro magazine mainly rely on private research firms for their data jantzi research and kld research analytics commerce magazine in quebec canada publishes an annual ranking of corporations based entirely on perceptions drawn from a for sources of measurable criteria of normative relevance a committee can consider the standards that are produced by numerous organizations that propose norms for social and environmental auditing eg the global reporting initiative sa and various iso consider for example two rival dvds the the high cost of low prices or the why works and why this makes people crazy or for a more balanced assessment of the debates see fishman the presence of a tobacco company rothmans among the best corporate citizens in corporate knights ranking stirred considerable controversy hyperlink httpaddr httpaddr for debates about the significance of an aggregative function to produce an ethical see norman and macdonald and and pava there are also numerous international initiatives to reach agreement on relevant types of data if not methods of aggregation for ethical and social reporting including the global reporting initiative and various networks in the socially responsible investment movement including one spearheaded by the siri company hyperlink httpaddr httpaddr see eg the scheme developed by the consultancy ethicsscan and explained in their book shopping with a conscience for example regarding the and family criteria ethicscan allows up to points to the companies depending on different elements number of female managers senior managers and directors up to points presence of a formal employment policy points types of policies implemented up to points daycare service points and longer maternity leaves on the other hand points are also subtracted if there as been sexual harassment hearings related to the company minus points per gender and family issues make up just one of six broad categories this scheme takes into account business office centre for applied business

of feet vehicle must be hardware based and controlled through software activating the must bring vehicle to a quick and complete stop during the performance events autonomous challenge and navigation challenge wireless will be held by the safety light the vehicle must have an easily viewed indicator light which is turned on whenever the vehicle power is on the light must go from solid to flashing whenever the vehicle in autonomous mode as soon as the vehicle comes out of mode the light needs to go back to payload each vehicle will be required to carry a payload the shape and size is approximately that of an x x cinder block refer to section i apriori data the intent is to compete without apriori memorized data course position data should not be this is difficult to enforce each team is expected to comply with intent both the autonomous challenge and navigation challenge will be changed after each heat and between runs to negate memorization or course familiarization i the payload must be securely mounted on the vehicle if payload falls off the vehicle during a run the run will terminated the payload specifications are as follows long inches wide inches high and a weight of i all vehicles must pass qualification to receive award money in the design competition and compete in the events autonomous challenge and navigation to qualification the vehicle must all of the length the vehicle will be measured to ensure that it is over minimum of three feet long and under the maximum of seven width the vehicle will be measured to ensure that it is over minimum of two feet wide and under the maximum of five feet height the vehicle will be measured to ensure that it does not exceed six feet high this excludes emergency stop mechanical the mechanical will be checked location to ensure it is located on the center rear of vehicle minimum of two feet high and a maximum of four feet high and wireless the wireless will be checked to that it is effective for a minimum of feet during performance events the wireless will be held by the safety light the safety light will be checked to ensure that the vehicle is powered up the light is on and solid and when vehicle is running in autonomous mode the light goes from solid to flashing then from flashing to solid when the vehicle comes of autonomous speed the vehicle will have to drive over a prescribed where its minimum and maximum speeds will be determined vehicle must not drop below the minimum of one mile per hour not exceed the maximum speed of ten miles per hour minimum of one mph will be assessed in the fully autonomous mode verified over a foot distance between the lanes and obstacles no change to maximum speed control hardware is after qualification if the vehicle completes a performance at a speed faster then the one it passed qualification at that will not be lane following the vehicle must demonstrate that it can and follow obstacle avoidance the vehicle must demonstrate that it detect and avoid waypoint navigation vehicle must prove it can find a path to single two meter navigation waypoint by navigating around during the qualification the vehicle must be put in autonomous mode verify the mechanical and wireless and to verify minimum lane following and obstacle avoidance the vehicle software can reconfigured for waypoint navigation qualification for the max run the vehicle may be in autonomous mode or controlled judges will not qualify vehicles that fail to meet requirements teams may fine tune their vehicles and for qualification there is no penalty for not qualifying the time vehicles that are judged to be unsafe will not be allowed compete in the event of any conflict the decision will i indemnification and teams will be required to sign an application form prior to along with the application form there will be a waivers claims that will need to be signed by each individual who will participating at the additionally the sponsoring institution will also be to supply auvsi with a certificate of insurance at the time application form is submitted the certificate is to show general liability coverage in an amount not less than note the igvc committee and officials will try to adhere to the official competition details rules and format as much as however it reserves the right to change or modify the where deemed necessary for preserving fairness of the modifications if any will be announced prior to the competition early as ii autonomous challenge all teams must pass qualification to participate in this ii a fully autonomous unmanned ground robotic vehicle must around an outdoor obstacle course under a prescribed time maintain a minimum of speed of one mph and a maximum speed limit of mph remaining the lane negotiating flags and avoiding obstacles on the judges will rank the entries that complete the course based on adjusted time taken in the event that a vehicle does not finish course the judges will rank the entry based on longest distance traveled adjusted time and distance are the net scores by judges after taking penalties incurred from obstacle collisions boundary crossings into ii vehicle vehicles must be unmanned and autonomous they must compete based their ability to perceive the course environment and avoid vehicles cannot be remotely controlled by a human operator competition all computational power sensing and control must be carried on board the vehicle there will be no base allowed for position accuracy allowed teams are encouraged to map course and use that information to improve their performance on ii obstacle the course will be laid out on grass over an area of approximately meters long by meters wide and be feet in length distance is identified so teams can set their maximum speed to the course pending no prior violations resulting in run track width will vary from ten to twenty feet wide with a radius not less than five the course outer boundaries will be designated by continuous or white lane markers lines approximately three inches wide painted the ground track width will be approximately ten feet wide with turning radius not less than five feet alternating dashes will be feet long with feet separation a speed will be required of one mph and will be a requirement qualification and verified in each run of the autonomous challenge the vehicle is not average one mph for the first feet from starting line the vehicle run will be ended the vehicle will need to average over one mph to complete the course within the minute time competitors should expect natural or artificial inclines with not to exceed and randomly placed obstacles along the course course will become more difficult to navigate autonomously as progresses obstacles on the course will consist of various white orange brown green black etc of construction drums are used on roadways and highways natural obstacles such as trees shrubs and manmade obstacles such as light posts or street signs also appear on the course the placement of the obstacles may randomized from left right and center placements prior to every there will be a minimum of six feet clearance minimum passage between the line and the obstacles ie if the obstacle is in middle of the course then on either side of the obstacle will be feet of driving space or if the obstacle is closer to one side of lane then the other side of the obstacle must have at least six feet driving space for the vehicles also on the course there will complex barrel arrangements with switchbacks and center islands will be adjusted for location between runs direction of the course will not change between alternating red right flags and green left flags will be placed the later part of the course flags will have a minimum passage between them of six feet ie if the flag is near the edge of course then between the flag and the line will be six feet of space flags are not obstacles and vehicles can touch flags increase speed and optimized route vehicles are not allowed to go flags the objective is for the vehicle to stay to the right of the flags and to the left of the green flags flags can be staggered the vehicle could be driving through a set of practice autonomous flag configurations autonomous challenge will contain eight global positioning system waypoints one in each corner four total and one at each opening four at the intersection openings vehicles will to use the waypoints to get from point a to point b in the course figure above the two pair of navigation waypoints the team use to go point to point either to or to the open between the navigation waypoints will contain a mix of obstacles must be avoided while staying the teams will have to choose how they want to run the course there be two paths that are the same distance in length and teams can choose always to run the same path or run any combination the two paths examples of the paths would be start and go from or start and go from point teams do not have cross through the actual points they are there to assist and use the team seem ii competition the competition will take place in the event of light rain drizzle but not in heavy rain or each qualified team will have the up to two runs time in each of three will assign a designated starting order will setup in that order failure to be will you at the end of the order for the run and may forfeit you second run in a heat based on heat time no team participant is allowed on the course before the first run and only one team member is allowed on the course a run this shall in no case be the faculty at the designated time the competing team will be asked prepare their vehicle for an attempt teams start in order they arrive in the starting area unless they give way another the starting official will call teams to the starting line starting direction is final the starting official alter the order to enhance the competition flow of entries slower vehicles may be grouped together to allow the running of vehicles on the course a team will have one minute in the starting point to prep vehicle for the judge to start the the judge will start the vehicle by a one touch motion hitting the enter key of a keyboard a left mouse click the up flipping a toggle switch an attempt will be declared valid when a designated judge gives start signal at the designated competing time an attempt continue until one of the following the vehicle finishes the the vehicle was by a the team the five minutes have passed after the vehicle run has the vehicle has not started after one minute after moving to start line or at the teams will ready the vehicle for start and advice the igvc judge push one button to start the vehicle the vehicle must be ready a judges start command in one an official will carry the time for each heat will be strictly tactile sensors will not be each vehicle will be given minutes per attempt to complete course if the vehicle has not completed the course in the time period it will ended by a choice with no assigned for that each vehicle must navigate the course by remaining inside the boundaries and navigating around course obstacles for the traffic violations the appropriate ticket will be issued and from the overall distance or time score refer to section ii violation ii practice all teams that have qualified will be given six each token represent one opportunity to use the autonomous practice course the course will be open daily for use from the time team qualifies till the start of the third heat of the challenge the course will be run like the autonomous challenge the same rules and similar obstacles one token allows a maximum six minutes one minute at the start point and five minutes for run on the autonomous challenge practice course in that time must position your vehicle at the start prep the vehicle for the to start and can continue to run as long as you do not break any the rules of the autonomous challenge if so your run and time will be ended all teams will still have unlimited access to regular practice ii traffic violation traffic ticket end of time to leave the careless choice choice blocking loss of wrong side of run over too slow did not go traffic must maintain mph there will be a speed at foot mark of the course will result in end of run with leave the all portions of the vehicle cross boundary the overall distance will be measured from the line to the furthest point where the final part of the crossed the boundary outside crash the overall distance will be measured from the starting to the collision point with the careless driving crossing the boundary while at least some part the vehicle remains in student student is used if the team feels there may be damaged caused to their vehicle or they know that is stuck and want to end their judge the overall distance will be measured from starting line to the front of the vehicle or where remaining part of vehicle if stopped crossed boundary outside obstacle displacement defined as displacing permanently obstacle from its original position an with no permanent displacement is not considered blocking traffic vehicles stopping on course for over one will be stopped and loss of payload if the payload falls of the vehicle the run be wrong side of flag vehicles must remain on the left side of flags and the right side of green run over flag vehicles drive over the top of a red or green will results in end of too slow if the vehicle does not maintain mph minimum limit throughout the course there will be a large penalty asset the ii how competition will be a team of judges and officials will determine compliance with designated competition judges will determine the official distances and ticket deductions of each entry at the end of competition those vehicles crossing the finish line will be on the time taken to complete the course minus any deductions ticket values will be assessed in seconds one foot one second if the vehicle completes the course within the minute run the team with the adjusted shortest time will be declared in the event that no vehicle completes the course the score be based on the distance traveled by the vehicle minus the deductions the team with the adjusted longest distance will declared the for standard award money consideration entry must sufficient degree of autonomous mobility by passing the barrel the money barrel location is determined by the during the course layout if a tie is between entries the award money will be split between ii grounds for judges will disqualify any vehicle which appears to be a hazard or violate the safety requirements during the intentional interference with another vehicle data link will result in disqualification of the damaging the course or deliberate movement of the obstacles running over the obstacles may result in actions designed to damage or destroy an vehicle are in the spirit of the competition and will result disqualification of the offending iii design all teams must participate in the design iii although the ability of the vehicles to negotiate competition courses is the ultimate measure of product quality officials are also interested in the design strategy and process engineering teams follow to produce their vehicles design judging be by a panel of expert judges and will be conducted separate from without regard to vehicle performance on the test course judging be based on a written report an oral presentation and examination the design innovation is a primary objective of this competition will be given special attention by the judges innovation is to be a technology hardware or software that has not ever been by this or any other vehicle in this competition the innovation to be documented as an innovation clearly in the written report emphasized in the oral iii written the report should not exceed pages graphic material and all appendices but not including the title reports will lose points in scoring for each page over spacing must be at least with at least a point font each vehicle must have a distinct and complete report its own a report cannot cover more than one are required to submit four hard copies of the report and an copy in pdf format on a cd failure to submit either of these result in disqualification all reports both for new vehicles and earlier vehicles with design changes must include a statement by the faculty advisor certifying that the design and engineering the vehicle original or changes by the current student team has significant and equivalent to what might be awarded credit in a design course the certification should also include a description of the areas in which changes have been made to a from a previous year everything must be mailed so as to arrive by addressed bernard curie warren mi written reports arriving after that date will lose points scoring for each business day late electronic copies arriving that date will lose points in scoring for each business day teams are encouraged to submit reports even several weeks early avoid the last minute rush of preparing vehicles for the and there will be no penalty for last minute changes in the from the design reported the electronic copy of the report will posted on the web site in pdf format after the of the the paper should present the conceptual design of the vehicle its components especially important to highlight are any innovative aspects of the design and the intelligence aspects of vehicle also included must be descriptions design planning electrical signal plan for path software both solid dashed plan for control system integration high speed design of the lane following and obstacle systems must be specifically described along with how the uses mapping techniques to perceive and navigate through environment describe how the system uses gps for waypoint and components acquired must be identified but their components need not be described in detail the steps followed the design process should be described along with any use design how considerations of reliability and durability were addressed in the design process be specifically described as well as problems encountered in design process and how they were overcome the analysis leading to predicted performance of the vehicle should be ramp climbing reaction battery distance at which obstacles are how the vehicle deals with complex obstacles switchbacks and center islands dead ends traps and accuracy of arrival at navigation comparison of these predictions with actual trial data although cost itself is not a factor in judging these are research vehicles the report should include a cost estimate counting student labor for the final product if it were to duplicated a breakdown of the cost by component is the team organization and the names of all members of the team with academic department and class should be included along an estimate of the total number of vehicles that have been entered in igvc in earlier years and not had significant changes in design are ineligible in either design or performance events vehicles that have been significantly in design hardware or software from an earlier year eligible but will require a completely new design report pages less treating both the old and new features thus describing complete vehicle as if it were all judges will score the written reports as maximum conduct of the design process and team including software completeness of the quality of documentation english grammar and effective innovation represented in the design as described del description of mapping description of electronic description of software description of systems descriptions to include lane following obstacle avoidance and waypoint navigation gps or efficient use of power and attention given to safety reliability and iii oral the technical talk should relate the highlights of the report described above and include any updates of the design since written report audio or video tape presentations of the text are allowed but graphic aids may be presented by video slide computer projection overhead transparencies or easel charts presentation must be made by one or more student members of the team the judges and other interested members of the audience and should not more than minutes a penalty of points will be assessed each minute or fraction thereof over minutes after presentation judges only may ask questions for up to minutes audience should be considered as a senior management group of knowledgeable engineers upon whom the project is dependent for and the team is dependent for their employment scoring will be judges will score the oral presentations as maximum clear and understandable explanation of logical organization of effective use of graphic demonstrated simulation of vehicle control in performance response to effective use of graphic aids includes not blocking the view the screen by the presenter and simple enough graphics that are enough to read block diagrams rather than detailed circuit articulation refers to the clarity and loudness of speaking to questions means short answers that address only the salesmanship refers to the enthusiasm and pride exhibited why vehicle is the participants are responsible for providing their own visual aids related equipment the vehicle itself may be projector will be made available projectors also be supplied by the during the oral presentation the following question period and examination of the vehicle team members sitting the audience participate by assisting the oral presenters but at no time is faculty advisor to participate in this part of the design iii examination of the the vehicle must be present and will be examined by the preferably immediately after the oral presentation or at convenient time the time during the competition software is included in this judging judging will be as judges will score the vehicle examinations as maximum packaging neatness efficient use of degree of original content in the vehicle as opposed to style overall iii final the number of points awarded by the individual judges will averaged for each of the judging areas above and these results be offered to each participating team for their edification the of the average scores over all areas max will be used determine the when two teams of judges are used due to a large number entries each judging team will determine the top three winners their group and the resulting six contestants will participate in runoff of oral presentations and vehicle examinations judged by judges to determine an overall design winner the six teams will judged in random for the finals competition three criteria from the written judging will be added to the normal oral presentation scoring above for preliminary judging thus the finals oral scoring will have maximum points as judges will score the final presentations as maximum clear explanation of description of mapping description of electronic description of software description of system logical organization of the effective use of graphic demonstrated simulation of vehicle response to the vehicle examination scoring will be the same as in the judging as shown iv navigation all teams must pass qualification to participate in this iv navigation is a practice that is thousands of years old it used on land by hikers and soldiers on the sea by sailors and in air by pilots procedures have continuously improved to moss on trees to dead reckoning to observation to use of the gps the challenge in this event is for vehicle to autonomously travel from a starting point to a number target destinations waypoints or landmarks and return to home given only the coordinates of the targets in latitude and iv it is expected that most contestants will use differential but gps is allowed as well as dead reckoning compasses gyros and wheel odometers vision systems sonar laser rangefinders may be used for obstacle detection there are number of handheld gps systems that connect to laptop available on the market for under garmin magellan are some earthmate even has one for macintosh these may be convenient to integrate in vehicle control programs differential gps units are available from hemisphere gps thales magellan garmin novatel and starlink and possibly differential correction signals are available in the southeast area from the us coast guard waas or any of the suppliers of corrections are also allowed the use of a base to supplement the on board gps unit is not iv gps the map in the figure below shows a typical course for the challenge this is a practice map for use by teams during of their vehicle coordinates for the actual navigation waypoints and the origin will be given to the contestants on june in degrees latitude and longitude but no xy coordinates will provided there will be three meter square finish boxes for each heat outside the main course in which teams will set up vehicles before their the competition course will be run on grass and will be by meters roughly acre and the total travel distance the course will be on the order of meters depending on the chosen for the vehicles the exact waypoint locations will be marked the grass for use by the judges but there will be no standup to indicate those positions construction barrels barricades and certain other obstacles will be located on the course in positions that they must be circumvented to reach the waypoints may be randomly moved between the course will be divided into two areas by a fence with a two wide opening located somewhere along it no coordinates are the opening will be randomly relocated along the fence at the start each run waypoints south of the fence the valley will have meter diameter circles or squares around them visible only to judges and waypoints north of the fence the mesa will have two circles around no team participant is allowed on the course before the first run and only one team member is allowed on the course during run this shall in no case be the faculty practice navigation iv practice all teams will have access to the practice course the navigation challenge practice course will have obstacles to the ones on the navigation challenge there will be minimum of three practice waypoints on the course for teams to their system iv run procedure and there will be three heats during the day with start and stop times same as those in the autonomous challenge it is intended that team will be allowed up to two runs in each heat there will be starting boxes so each team that manages three runs will start each of the boxes during the course of three heats in order teams should choose any free starting that they have not been in before until they have started in three after three runs they will begin the cycle of boxes again trial with the best performance will be used for scoring times will be within each heat except teams up for their first trial will have priority over those wanting second trial it is unlikely that there will be time in the day all registered teams to get six vehicles will park in the starting box selected and have up to minutes or until the course is clear for final adjustments starting vehicles may seek the waypoints in any order and vehicle actually reaching the most waypoints counting also boxes in the allotted six minute run time will be winner the vehicle must finish in the same box in which it if two or more vehicles reach the same number of waypoints the doing so in the least time will be declared the leader if two or vehicles reach the same number of waypoints while stopped by rule they will be declared tied and will share any if a vehicle any part fails to come within two meters of target in the southern area of the course or one meter in the area it will not be judged to have reached that target in order qualify for standard award money a vehicle must reach at least waypoints not counting the iv run all runs will be terminated by an by the students or judges signaled by a whistle or bell when the vehicle arrives back at the original point enters any box any time after first if any part of the vehicle leaves the perimeter of the field than at a if the vehicle strikes any if six minutes have elapsed since the start of the run in six minutes is miles per in all cases the call will be v jaus participation in the jaus challenge is v technical each entry will interface with the cop providing information specified below the general approach to the jaus interface will be respond to a periodic status and position requests from the cop requires the support of the jaus transport specification the jaus core service set the jaus transport supports several communication protocols the competition will use the ethernet based judp the core services required for the include the discovery access control and management services jaus mobility service set as or defines messaging to be used for position communications and waypoint v common operating the cop will provide a high level view of the systems in operation successfully implement the jaus protocol as described above software is a simple validation reporting and recording tool for judges to use while verifying student implementations of the standard it provides a graphical display of the operational area relative coordinates primitive graphics are loaded in the display the cop to add perspective each reported status is displayed on cop user interface and recorded for future reference for and systems reporting positional data a d map on the cop display annotated with the updated position as well as track marks showing previous position of the system for the current v communications the teams will implement a wireless or hardwired rj data link the interface can be implemented at any point in student system including the control station or the internet protocol ip address to be used will be provided at competition for planning purposes this address will be in the of to the cop will have and capabilities where the ip address of the will be all teams will be provided an ip address to used during the competition the last octet of the ip address significant as it will also be used as the subsystem identifier in jaus id the port number for all jaus traffic shall be v jaus specific the jaus id mentioned above is a critical piece of data used by a node to route messages to the correct process or attached device indicated above each team will be provided an ip address in which last octet will be used in their respective jaus id a jaus id of three elements a subsystem id a node id and a component id subsystem id uniquely identifies a major element that is an system an unmanned system controller or some other entity on a with unmanned systems a node id is unique within a subsystem identifies a processing element on which jaus components can be a component id is unique within a node represents an to from which jaus messages are sent and received the last octet of assigned ip address will be used as the jaus subsystem id for the team assigned the ip address of the jaus id of the component might be where node and component are both assigned the ids of this is shown in ip and jaus id assignment figure below the node id and component are discussed further in the jaus service definition language standard the cop software will programmed with the assumption that all services required by specific competition are implemented on a single ip and jaus id in summary each team will be assigned an ip address by the judges last octet of that ip address will be the subsystem the cop will be a subsystem as will each entry in competition the cop will have a jaus id of and an ip address the port number shall be v competition task messages passed between the cop and the team entries will include as described in the task descriptions below the cop will initiate requests subsequent to the discovery process described as task system management component is required of all teams this will implement several of the messages defined by the service defined in the this service inherits the control events and transport services also defined by the document the implementation of the access control interfaces will necessary to meet the jaus challenge requirements however no from the events service will be exercised the sequence diagram discovery and system management figure shows the required for discovery including the access control setup and system protocol this interaction is required for every the judges will evaluate each ability to meet interoperability challenge for the tasks described below in with the scoring judges will score the task as maximum transport capabilities system velocity state position and orientation waypoint v transport for any two elements in the system to communicate meaningful data must first be a handshake to ensure both sides use the same and are willing participants in the interaction for the sake simplicity the entry shall initiate the discovery protocol the cop and the ip address and jaus id of the cop shall fixed the ip address and jaus id of the cop are defined cop ip address cop jaus id the discovery process in discovery and system management figure occur at the application layer the student jaus element send a request for identification to the cop once every seconds cop will respond with the appropriate informative message and identification in return from the jaus interface after identification report from the cop the team entry will stop the request this transaction will serve as the basic discovery the two the cop software will be programmed with the assumption that services required by the specific competition are provided at single jaus id furthermore as per the specification entry shall receive judp traffic at the same ip address and number that initiated the discovery protocol teams should note this is different from common udp programming approaches in which outbound port for sent messages is not discovery and system the following table shows the messages sent from the cop to the entry along with the expected response and minimal required fields be set using the presence vector pv if applicable required complete this portion of the input expected required

improving its software is almost bag here is one by robert m bell jim bennett yehuda koren chris volinsky page view photo randi pm on october at labs in florham park and three of us are frantically hitting the refresh buttons on browsers we have just submitted our latest entry in the netflix prize competition which offers a grand prize of us for an algorithm percent more accurate than the one uses to predict movie preferences although we have reached that milestone we are hoping at least to do better than else has done so far if we can make it to pm with the best win a progress prize for most of the summer ahead of our nearest rivals by a comfortable margin and as recently hours before this moment our victory still seemed to be a the previous day though the lead had started to slip away from first the teams then in fifth and sixth places merged combining talents to vault into second place making us nervous enough to our best effort which we had been saving for a rainy day but our improved score appeared we were hit by another combination our two remaining serious rivals joined forces to tie us worse entry had come seconds before ours meaning that in the case of tie seconds could we lose this thing for being a minute late then we realized that there were still hours left and still had one more chance we had to make it we began to receive offers from other competitors to combine our with theirs we politely declined them and planned strategies for last submission sure enough these bumped up our score by a hundredths of a percent at which point we could only wait to see final score from our newly allied since when netflix of los gatos calif came up with the of sending movie dvds through the mail to subscribers its base has grown to million that success stems in part from giving quick and easy access to movies but just as is the netflix recommender system cinematch which helps customers the most out of their memberships the better the system likes and dislikes the more enjoy the movies watch and the longer keep up their as a new subscriber to netflix you have several ways to choose on the web site you can browse by genre or search by for a title actor or director after receiving your selections mail or over the internet and viewing them you return to the site order more movies at any time cinematch lets you rate any seen by clicking on one to five as is the case with other recommender systems such as those of the internet movie database and pandora in the interest to vote thoughtfully because doing so helps netflix out his or her tastes yet even if the customer declines to offer feedback netflix still notes which movies the subscriber orders after the customer has rated a handful of movies the will start recommending titles based on the rating the predicts the customer will recommending movies that customers will enjoy is a complex the easy part is gathering the data which netflix now accumulates the rate of some million ratings a day much tougher is to patterns in the data that tell the company which movie a customer enjoy if only the person would watch netflix developed cinematch to tackle this job using a prediction technique described below which it designed to handle billion or so ratings it had already logged however incorporating so many ratings added to accuracy it also took a lot work just to keep up with the increasing scale let alone to alternative prediction the netflix researchers were nevertheless curious about the many techniques for making similar predictions that had been published the scholarly literature the problem was that those studies had on public data sets containing on the order of a few million and it would take the small netflix team a long time to explore well these alternative techniques worked at a scale a thousand times large that is if they did all the work reed hastings the chief executive of netflix suggested running contest he observed that netflix had the means the motive and opportunity and the company had already staged a contest between the standard cinematch system and an alternative which did slightly tantalizingly the netflix team came up with the basic structure of the contest would provide million ratings that anonymous customers given to movies the data set would just fit in the main of a typical laptop allowing almost anyone to compete netflix withhold million of the most recent ratings and ask the to predict them a netflix computer would assess each million predictions by comparing predictions with actual ratings system would use the traditional metric for predictive accuracy squared error the more accurate a set of the smaller the rmse will be the score would then be reported immediately to the contestant and reflected on an online for all to each such scoring provides valuable information about the valuable in fact that under certain circumstances could be used to game the system the teams were therefore scored a day at most but to help teams estimate how well they might netflix also provided them each with a small representative data and the score cinematch had been able to attain for it could use that set to test their systems as often as they on october netflix launched the competition and within thousands of teams from hundreds of countries signed up within the netflix prize web site was getting hundreds of submissions per an online forum was created so that participants could share ideas techniques even code even more gratifying to netflix within months handful of teams did several percent better than cinematch question then was how much the accuracy would improve in the like most of the other top competitors the three of us at consulted the rich body of research on ways of solving problems in domain known as collaborative one of the main areas of collaborative filtering we exploited is approach a neighbors in this context other movies that tend to be scored most similarly when rated by same viewer see illustration the neighborhood example consider saving private ryan a war movie directed steven spielberg and starring tom hanks its neighbors may other war movies movies directed by spielberg or movies starring hanks to predict a particular rating we would look for nearest neighbors to saving private ryan that the viewer had seen and rated for some viewers it may be easy to find a allotment of close neighbors for many others we may discover only handful of neighboring movies our version of the approach predicted ratings using a weighted average of the previous ratings on up to neighboring movies we have developed a way to use all past ratings allowing an unlimited of a second area of research we pursued what are known as models these score both a given and a given viewer according to a set of factors themselves from patterns in the ratings given to all the movies by all the see illustration the factors movies may measure comedy versus drama action versus romance orientation to children versus orientation to adults because factors are determined automatically by algorithms they may to concepts such as quirkiness or they may not interpretable by humans at all factors for viewers measure how the viewer likes movies that score highly on the corresponding factor thus a movie may be classified a comedy and a viewer may classified as a comedy the model may use to such factors to locate each movie and in a multidimensional space it then predicts a rating of movie according to the score on the dimensions that cares about most we can put these judgments in quantitative terms taking the dot or scalar product of the locations of the viewer the both techniques work even if you know thing about in the movies themselves all you need to care is how the viewers rate the movies however neither approach is panacea we found that most techniques work best on or fewer neighbors which means these methods exploit all information a ratings may contain models the opposite weakness they are bad at detecting strong among a few closely related films such as the lord of the trilogy because these two methods are complementary we combined them many versions of each in what experts call an approach this allowed us to build systems that were simple therefore easy to code and fast to more our ensemble approach was robust enough to protect some of the problems that arise within the components indeed the solution we had just submitted on was a linear combination of separate sets of using many variations on the above themes and different parameters even so the biggest improvements in accuracy came relatively few methods the lesson here is that having lots of ways skin this particular cat can be useful for gaining the improvements needed to win competitions but practically excellent systems can be built using just a few we want to give the impression that heaping together a lot methods was enough to reach the leaderboard the netflix prize data poses some huge challenges beyond its immense size for one there enormous variation among viewers and among movies a rating system be sensitive enough to tease out subtle patterns associated with few viewers who rated movies without overfitting thingsthat expecting prolific patterns to apply to the many more users rated or fewer movies it can indeed be hard to make predictions a viewer who has provided just a handful of ratings we existing ad hoc methods designed to address this concern another critical innovation involved focusing on which movies a rated regardless of the scores the idea is that someone who has a lot of fantasy movies will probably like lord of the rings even that person has rated the other movies in the category somewhat low replacing numerical scores with a binary score data set is transformed from one with mostly missing pieces the in which users rate movies to one that is completely full the value when there are ratings and a when there approach nicely complemented our other finally at on that fateful october evening all of the scores the top teams were posted for the last time on the leaderboard ours came out highest with an percent improvement on algorithm our nearest rival scored an percent improvement do well enough to land a million dollars but still we while since come very close to the goal of percent has shown that each step forward is harder than the one that before it presumably because already exploited most of the in the data nonetheless we continue to made progress during mined the data for information on how behavior changed time later we joined forces with another team to win the progress prize currently we stand at percent improvement and still working hard on the now that the confetti has settled we have a chance to look back on work and to ask what this experience tells us first netflix incorporated our discoveries into an improved version of its which is now being tested second researchers are benefiting from data set that the competition made available and not just because is orders of magnitude larger than previous data sets it is qualitatively better than other data sets because netflix gathered information from paying customers in a realistic setting third competition itself recruited many smart people in this line in any case the new blood promises to quickly improve the state of art such competitions have invigorated other fields the various prizes that have been offered for advances in genomics design and alternative energy have shown an excellent return by accounts the recent million ansari x prize awarded for spaceflight generated million of private investment in the competition also validates the concept of collective popularized in james book the wisdom of anchor he argues that the sum of many independent votes often superior to any one vote even if made by the greatest for netflix the vast number of independent ratings allows surprisingly good predictions the power of this intelligence is also being harnessed in for instance httpaddr product recommendations and the collaborative editing of the encyclopedia wikipedia with the rise of social networks on the we can expect to see and contribute to even more powerful examples the coming the robert m bell chris volinsky and yehuda koren worked together labs research in florham park nj where they competed for

appropriate with the national center that is expected to be in under the complementary b nationally there are public drinking water systems by epa and delegated to states and tribes that provide drinking to percent of drinking water systems have an impact on public health and the quality of life for the customers serve the public health benefits of a system cannot overstated customers rely on their water systems to provide safe for drinking bathing cleaning and cooking while trying to customer demands pws must address and manage chemical and contaminants that enter these over the past years than chemicals have entered the marketplace in the us that pose a threat to drinking water systems at some point in their cycle many of these chemicals enter drinking water sources from variety of inputs improperly disposed of chemicals activities wastes injected underground substances disinfection byproducts and improperly distribution these chemicals include pesticides and household chemicals pharmaceuticals such as inorganic anions cyanotoxins and nutrients and other very large drinking water systems serving over benefit from an economy of scale to develop test and employ drinking water treatment to respond to the growing number contaminants detected at low levels in their source this is not so for small pws as defined by epa that serve fewer frequently these systems are operated municipalities that must balance resources between the drinking plant operation and other public small community systems have even more difficult choices to make in selecting water treatment given the diminishing economies of scale and small systems treatment is often limited to which amplifies the need for scalable technologies that reduce production of disinfection fostering the development affordable efficient and technologies for small will better equip them to address health risks posed by a broad of under the sdwa the current assessment and regulatory process evaluates contaminants one at a time given the backlog of and unregulated contaminants awaiting review or the process could take decades to review a small subset of the universe for small pws trying to address and manage and provide safe and reliable drinking water this process more than percent of the public systems serve fewer than small systems face financial and operational challenges in providing drinking water meets epa standards these water systems may be isolated their staffs often lack the time expertise to needed infrastructure repairs install operate or maintain or develop comprehensive source water protection plans financial or asset management in addition given their small base many small water systems cannot develop or access the managerial and financial resources needed to comply with the number of epa and state regulations and rising customer in several thousand small pws failed to comply with contaminant levels for chemical relying on this traditional framework of chemical assessment management imposes an administrative burden and high requirement for state and local governments as well as utilities especially small systems as they try to deal with multiple statutory requirements for regulated and traditional frameworks also limit how address and respond to public health as result a primary challenge is to find effective and treatment technologies for small systems that are easy to use and not interfere with the compliance looking forward technologies and approaches must have the capacity to deal with of chemical contaminants and precursors in order to help utilities municipalities deal with the volume of regulated and contaminants these technologies must be sustainable in regard to and material resources energy requirements cost operation maintenance staffing and educational requirements as well treatment or mitigation in this regard this rfa is seeking the submission of projects to the research necessary for the

food production will need to double during a period when climate change will fossil fuels will dwindle and water availability will in addition if we are to protect what biodiversity we can doubling of agricultural output must take place using the same of farmland without impacting upon remaining natural to tackle this problem scientists in oxford department plant sciences are aiming to develop crop strains which be better adapted to this landscape of the near boosting rice professor jane langdale head of the department of plant sciences engaged in the project an international effort funded by bill melinda gates foundation more million people in currently depend on rice for the bulk of their calorific intake and is predicted that during the next years rice production needs increase by per cent in order to feed the growing asian whilst adapting to adverse changes in climate and water photosynthesis converts carbon dioxide and the energy from into chemical energy and takes place in cell organelles chloroplasts the chemical energy produced in these chloroplasts then used by plants to live grow and in the case of crops conventional rice varieties use a standard photosynthesis pathway as but under certain conditions such as warmer this pathway is inefficient a number of plants including maize evolved an extra photosynthesis pathway called to solve problem the c photosynthesis pathway can increase efficiency by per cent and iintroducing it into rice could provide the answer impending food the c rice project is often quoted as being order to work large changes need to be made to both the anatomy rice leaves and the chemical reactions that take place inside however there is encouraging evidence that it could be work on the glk genes suggests that they may play a role regulating whether a chloroplasts use c or c ongoing work in her laboratory seeks to put glk genes from maize naturally c crop into rice plants her work on chloroplasts began to an interest in the genetic control of development in plants than a specific aim to put c photosynthesis into other plant whilst developing new c crops had always seemed like an idea she never thought it would be years of chloroplast research later jane was ready to move into research areas it was at this point in that the rice research institute irri invited jane to a c rice workshop originally reluctant to go she was persuaded to attend julian hibberd from the university of cambridge and found getting excited by the proposed project she is now months into a year proof of concept project involved in testing the

agriculture will have to cope with the decline in fossil fuels the work of sherardian professor of botany liam dolan aims to produce crops grow healthily without excessive fertiliser phosphate is required by all living organisms to build components and the low availability of phosphate in environments can severely limit plant growth the soil of all africa and one third of china is deficient in this nutrient the application of artificial fertilisers all over the has so far dealt with this problem and contributed to the increase productivity seen in the green revolution of the th phosphate is extracted from mines mainly in morocco the usa the former soviet union and south africa with per cent of phosphate produced being put into fertilisers the extraction transport of phosphate for agricultural use constitutes a annual cost and carries a large carbon footprint furthermore oil phosphate reserves are finite and some predictions claim phosphate mines could be exhausted within the next work aims to develop crops which are better adapted to their own phosphate from the soil making them less dependent artificial plants can naturally extract their own phosphate from the soil root hairs structures which grow along roots research group have discovered a family of genes which control hair growth and they are working to modulate the expression of genes in crop plants their aim is to increase the number of root a plant produces in response to naturally occurring phosphate in soil they have developed transgenic wheat and rice varieties of producing longer root hairs and are now moving on to experiments to test the yield of these plants in the absence commercial unlike jane chloroplast work this has always been the for liam he jokes that his team are now finally at the stage he hoped to be at by the end of his phd explaining that this has been very large project starting from scratch and requiring the of all the necessary genes planning for st in light of the global food security crisis we will soon be facing department of plant sciences will next year be launching st century cropsresearch initiative this initiative seeks to an oxford professorship in crop science and to encourage research so that discoveries made about plant metabolism growth development can be transferred to agriculturally valuable crop however both jane and liam believe that whilst plant science has a to offer in solving the food security challenge the role governments and funding bodies is crucial a point that was at the security in the st symposium hosted by graduate students last due to the unequal distribution of global wealth the countries the most immediate problems do not have the funds to overcome jane argues that to tackle food security there must be funding and input from wealthy countries in order to bring developing nation benefits liam points out that every day the number of people die from malnutrition as from cancer reflecting bias of interest in developed countries however whilst research alone cannot solve the issue of food security in the face global politics it is says jane a very exciting time to be a penny sarchet is based at oxford department of

this call with a total budget of eur project title evolution of development in abstract different morphologies evolve in different organisms response to changing environments as land plants developmental mechanisms were either generated de novo or recruited from existing toolkits and adapted to facilitate changes form some of these changes occurred once others on occasions and others were gained and then subsequently lost in subset of lineages why have certain forms survived and others not does a fern look different from a flowering plant and why developmental biologists care by determining how many different there are to generate a particular morphology we gain an of whether a particular transition is constrained this information allows an assessment of the extent to which variation can modify developmental mechanisms and an indication of degree of developmental plasticity that is possible both within and between species this proposal aims to characterize developmental mechanisms that underpin the diverse shoot forms seen extant plant species the main goal is to compare mechanisms that operate in vegetative shoots of bryophytes ferns and angiosperms with a view to understanding the that limit morphological variation specifically we will the developmental basis of three major innovations that altered morphology of vegetative shoots during land plant evolution formation of a embryo organization of apical centres and patterning of leaves in distinct spatial along the shoot to facilitate progress we also aim to transgenic methods create mutant populations and generate transcriptomes for species at key phylogenetic nodes proposed work will generate scenarios to explain how land plant evolved and perhaps more importantly how it could change in more mabberley

germination of the fungal spore and growth of the emerging tube to differentiation of the specialized infection cell appressorium and penetration of host leaves the transcript profile one gene nos was upregulated fold at the time of maturation and penetration compared with levels seen in ungerminated spore chemical inhibitors of nos enzymes inhibited formation of appressoria signifying a role for no in development however the small signalling molecule camp allowed appressoria formation in the presence of nos inhibitors camp acts downstream of no in a signalling pathway to permit investigation

infectious agents or bioproducts to the early origin of chronic diseases in chronic pulmonary diseases cause substantial morbidity and among people of all ages and represent a huge public health burden an estimated cost of billion dollars a year in the united some studies suggest that the chronic inflammation tissue and progressive loss of function that are observed in these could result from incompletely resolved lung infections also infection may not be the single explanation or cause of chronic diseases infectious agents may serve as or triggers inflammation or abnormal cell growth and proliferation in susceptible individuals examples of relevant findings that may lead insight into the pathogenesis of some chronic lung diseases detection of human herpesvirus hhv which is linked to development of sarcoma and disease in tissues individuals affected by primary pulmonary hypertension herpes viruses including epstein barr virus cytomegalovirus herpes viruses and in a majority of interstitial fibrosis ipf tissues viral infections have been implicated in etiology of sarcoidosis and latent adenovirus infections may the inflammatory reactions in also chlamydia pneumoniae has been linked to interstitial sarcoidosis hypersensitivity pneumonitis and other chronic diseases the search for an infectious agent in the pathogenesis of granuloma that is the hallmark of sarcoidosis has been far unsuccessful there have been reports of identification of material belonging to various infectious agents in but the epidemiological criteria for establishing an infectious as the cause of the disease such as consistent isolation of the from cases have not been satisfied the identification of contributing infectious agent in a lung disease could have a impact on public health strategies for prevention and control for of these diseases the establishment of an infectious agent as cause or a contributor to morbidity could revolutionize our to therapy and improve long term survival for many the nhlbi strongly encourages investigators with expertise infectious diseases especially virology bacteriology and to participate in this program in collaboration with pulmonary pathologists immunologists and molecular biologists important goal of this program is to move the research on agents and chronic lung diseases beyond associative or studies by supporting projects designed to yield information also through use of appropriate models it is expected that investigators will on and include research advances and techniques from the fields of cell biology proteomics and genetics eg analyses of gene in their proposed research programs multidisciplinary approaches research projects supported through this rfa may employ a variety experimental approaches including studies of biological cells fluids specimens from affected individuals animal systems and research on the potential role of novel pathogens for which evidence already exists for possible involvement of infectious agent are good candidates for this initiative are encouraged to use existing populations as appropriate to the question in humans and to establish collaborations with clinical research

microdissection conventional immunohistochemistry and molecular biology encouraged as are methods to isolate characterize and infectious agents from human specimens with the goal of their in the pathological characterization of direct specific molecular interactions products of infectious agents and infected cells the resulting altered cell phenotype and functions study indirect or systemic effects of infectious agents harbored in cells and inflammatory cells present at the site such macrophages and lymphocytes studies of specific mechanisms which infectious agents might modify the lung

baras is a on a new national foundation nsf grant award from the program in the large category entitled science of integration systems the five year grant which on october is a collaborative effort between universities vanderbilt university lead institution university notre dame and university of maryland in addition general corporation is a partner and direct participant in the research projectthe university of maryland share for the five years professor janos sztipanovits of vanderbilt university the principal investigator along with baras include antsaklis notre dame xenofon koutsoukos vanderbilt and shige general the proposed project is aimed at developing a new science integration for cyber physical systems this new the fundamentals of composition in heterogeneous develops foundations and tools for system integration and validates results in experiments using automotive and avionics experimental platforms the proposed new integration science a major departure from the current compartmentalized systems design building on a rigorous theory will develop the foundations and methods and tools for constructivity and predictability in cps integration the brings together a large interdisciplinary group of researchers design and software engineering vu umd in science and engineering nd umd in control theory and nd umd vu and in computer engineering and networking vu the overarching goal is to make integration of cps predictable and the research partner general motors center has been committed to join the team and to and electrical architecture challenge problems evaluation metrics and development it would be hard to find a technology other than systems of large cps that is more undervalued scientifically and at the time has bigger impact on the future of engineered systems the significance of this problem has been recognized long by industry considered to be a grand challenge the proposed research program three focus areas to change the status quo theory compositionality in heterogeneous systems tools and architectures for systemintegration and research theory of compositionality will extend and deepen mathematical foundations of system integration the primary approach to target simplification to develop and deploy theories and for decoupling that prevent or decrease the formation intractable interdependences and maintain on each layer for carefully selected essential system tools and tool architectures will focus on the foundations composing tool chains as components in tools will be achieved by exploring semantic foundation design key to this effort is research in and for composing transforming and models research is essential focusing the research team on problems validating experimentally and creating and transitioning results since experimental infrastructure for system integration is expensive for university projects the research team established a that involves a key industry stakeholder general motors global this project because of its focus on foundations will provide a paradigm based on modern systems science for integrating complex because of its attention to methodologies the research will new tools for incremental system integration and design methods ensure performance and safety beyond what can be achieved by ad hoc practices these outcomes of the project are prerequisites the cost effective development and deployment of many safety security critical cps ranging from medical devices to to defense and avionics the impact of this change on teaching research is profound and will comprise both undergraduate graduate levels at the participating institutions the team complement the conventional curriculum in systems with one that admits computation as a primary concept the changes will be aggressively promoted through a process of and textbook preparation to adapt the technical material to the of the participating institutions and will be disseminated widely project will engage undergraduate students from around the finally the attention to a new education model will create a generation of engineers who will be able to master the design complex heterogeneous systems that will be the backbone of the systems theodorakopoulos publish new book on path problems in path problems in professor john s baras and alumnus a senior researcher at the polytechnique de lausanne epfl have published a new titled path problems in the book is part of morgan synthesis lectures communication networks under the editorship of professor walrand of the university of california berkeley this is an series of to page publications on topics related to the implementation and management of communication networks each is a presentation of one topic by a leading expert topics range from algorithms to hardware implementations and cover broad spectrum of issues from security to the series addresses technologies from sensor networks reconfigurable optical the monograph provides a modern view on the algebraic path which is a generalization of the shortest path problem in various instances of this abstract problem have appeared in literature and similar solutions have been independently and rediscovered the repeated appearance of a problem is evidence its relevance this book aims to help current and future add this powerful tool to their arsenal so that they can identify and use it in their own path problems in networks can be conceptually divided into two parts distillation of the extensive theory behind the algebraic path and an exposition of a broad range of applications first the path problem is presented so as to fix terminology and existence and uniqueness of solutions robustness to parameter and centralized and distributed computation algorithms then concepts are generalized to the algebraic context of semirings for creating new semirings useful for modeling new problems provided a large part of the book is then devoted to applications of the algebraic path problem ranging from mobile routing to bgp routing to social networks these applications show kind of problems can be modeled as algebraic path problems they serve as examples on how to go about modeling new this monograph will be useful to network researchers engineers graduate students it can be used either as an introduction to topic or as a quick reference to the theoretical facts and application examples the theoretical background assumed for reader is that of a graduate or advanced undergraduate student computer science or engineering some familiarity with algebra algorithms is helpful but not necessary algebra in particular used as a convenient and concise language to describe problems that essentially the monograph is available for free electronically for licensing institutions including the university of maryland from web site httpaddr print copies can be obtained from the amazon tabatabaee awarded new nsf nets professor john baras has been awarded a new national foundation nsf networking technology and systems nets for component based routing and clique based scheduling modular design of mobile networks the grant provide in funding over three years dr vahid tabatabaee the tabatabaee was by former faculty leandros tassiulas and dr baras and received his phd in engineering in tabatabaee is a former isr assistant scientist now with broadcom corporation in san jose systematic methodologies for the design of distributed implementable routing and scheduling algorithms that enable one design provision and manage mobile wireless networks with and controllable performance are lacking the research project a new framework for modular design of scheduling routing algorithms for networks efficient routing scheduling algorithm for networks are among the most network problems the proposed research some of the assumptions of wireless network methods are used for scheduling where cliques are in the interference graph a clique based scheduler first identifies group of critical cliques whose weights are close to the maximum schedule hence scheduling turns into finding an independent set nodes network links that cover the cliques clique based policies developed to achieve optimal throughput and as basis for implementable algorithms for scheduling clique based scheduling easier and more flexible because to schedule a clique we can any link of it and when a link is scheduled all cliques that belongs to are scheduled it also provides a pathway to extend calculus results to provide deterministic performance bounds wireless for the routing a design model is used that the routing protocol into components with separate design stability agility and flexibility are better achieved through architecture these solutions are still but they have well defined interfaces for signaling control information exchange between components and layers performance provide a systematic methodology to study and quantify the and sensitivity of the network performance to its parameters performance models provide a traceability mechanism connects the network requirements to the components and design abstractions and lead to the development of an effective modular design methodology for networks clique congestion metrics provide a promising and exciting venue to and develop novel traffic engineering algorithms for wireless the research will yield new principles and fundamental for the design performance evaluation and control of wireless networks the methodologies can be used to estimate capacity region of wireless networks the project will optimization algorithms and algorithms for computations the component based design model of the project applications to other areas of networking like vehicular and infrastructure faculty honored

professor shihab shamma assistant professor timothy professor john s baras professor krishnaprasad and professor cynthia moss are part a million defense advanced research projects darpa contract for intelligent and interfaces for acoustic sensors the goal of this contract is to formulate and implement signal processing systems and technology that can control and utilize the noisy mems sensor the university of maryland faculty are part of a research group includes johns hopkins university the university of australia and signal systems corp severna park the is part of acoustic microsensor technology project acoustic mems offer exciting opportunities for a wide of applications for robust sound detection analysis and in noisy environments the most important advance these sensors is the potential for fabricating and utilizing miniature and intelligent sensor elements and arrays in particular mems make possible for the first time to conceive of applications which arrays of interacting creating in effect distributed sensory fields to achieve this potential however it essential that these sensors be coupled to signal conditioning processing circuitry that can tolerate their inherent noise environmental sensitivity without sacrificing the unique advantages compactness and the fundamental challenge that we address in this proposal one that critical to any real application of mems sensors is how to design and implement signal processing systems and technology that adapt control and utilize the noisy mems sensor more specifically we will focus our technology transition efforts developing a smart microphone suitable for outdoor surveillance on robotic vehicles this smart microphone incorporate mems sensors for acoustic sensing wind noise turbulence sensing platform vibration sensing and a analog very large scale integration adaptive these intelligent and noise robust interface capabilities will enable new class of small effective surveillance sensors sensor interfaces and noise reduction circuits will be small enough be mounted on future robots our interfaces will consume less than current systems by including silicon cochlea based classification and localization processing these sensors can acoustic surveillance the resulting smart technology will be very power efficient enabling a networked array autonomous sensors that can be integrated miniaturized robots or deployed by we envision such a sensory processing system to be fully with sophisticated capabilities beyond the passive sound reception typical microphones smart mems sensors may possess a wide range intelligent capabilities depending on the specific application they may simply extract and transmit elementary acoustic sound loudness pitch or location or learn and perform decisions and to achieve these goals we propose to develop and utilize technologies that can perform these functions robustly and at extremely low power an equally important innovation will be formulation of algorithms that are intrinsically matched to characteristic strengths and weaknesses of the technology theoretical and technological innovations are fully intertwined in proposed research program and we believe that both approaches must developed simultaneously so as to achieve truly functional smart sensory systems that exploit the potential of acoustic mems the fundamental innovative thrust of our work focuses on development of biomimetic auditory interfaces and algorithms and implementations an analog or hybrid vlsi poovendran win integrated security services professor john s baras

management the goal is to realize the vision of integrated access control authentication and architecture to support dynamic consisting of varied members with diverse interests and administrative the contract has been awarded under program on assurance and survivability dynamic coalitions section the project for the period march to march and the contract award funds are the goal will achieved by providing an integrated set of security policies services for different system platforms network infrastructures applications and by demonstrating new security currently this goal has not been attainable because the inability to represent negotiate and enforce a security policy across multiple system platforms and infrastructures the lack of secure services and particularly efficient and security policies enable management of group access rights within time constraints the absence of visual tools for security definition and the university of maryland team believes that the ability to coalitions with diverse and rapidly changing membership is an enabler for a multitude of applications in national defense and commerce to address the dynamic coalition problem our team analyze fundamental properties of and provide tools and servers security policy representation negotiation and enforcement different system platforms pki and including frequent distribution review and

recent announcement of the dedication of million for an early learning competition through the race to learning challenge and we look forward to continuing partner with you to improve the quality of early learning as you work to design the race to the learning we urge you to require states to incorporate several reforms into their early learning systems in order to be for which are consistent with principles in the early learning challenge fund provisions contained in iv of hr the student aid and fiscal responsibility safra passed by the house in a primary focus of the program to increase access early care and education programs for the most early learning and development standards that promote readiness and are integrated with programmatic and a quality rating system that is and with progressive levels of quality together with funding to program program review and oversight that is applied across programs and a comprehensive professional development system that prepare and an effective and workforce of early appropriate levels of training education credentials an outreach strategy to promote understanding by parents families how to support their early development and learning states early learning program rating system and the rating of early learning program in which the child is coordinated systems to facilitate screening and referrals health mental health disability and family a coordinated data infrastructure to collect information on where young children spend their time and quality of the programs that serve them an age and curriculum assessment system for early learning programs that is used support best practices and improve school we also encourage the grant program contain a funding stream available to states which may not be able to all the requirements of the new grant program but which would to start to increase the quality of their early care and systems so as to compete for additional resources in the this approach was also contained in safra through the inclusion development grants sec as you know in addition to educational outcomes early education programs also have a profound impact on later crime and violence kids who were left out of perry preschool program were five more likely to be chronic offenders more than arrests by age than those who participated a study of child parent centers showed that children who participated were percent more likely to graduate from high school by age and percent more likely to have attended a year college by age than similar kids left out of the program by age those who not attend the centers were percent more likely have been arrested for a felony and percent more likely to spent time in jail research has demonstrated that that the highest quality such as the perry preschool and child parent achieve the best results a new race to the competition dedicated to early learning that incorporates crucial reforms from safra will help states significantly the quality of their early learning systems expanding access the most kids to programs that will have the educational and on behalf of law enforcement leaders who have seen too many grow up to become criminals thank

children nemours also operates brightstart an early screening and differentiated program that is targeted to four who are risk of reading as a foundation nemours recognizes the importance of access to quality early learning programs as you develop and eligibility requirements for early learning challenge we request that you take the following recommendations require states to include various early learning and child settings in their plans to transform their early learning early learning and development occurs in a multitude of settings child care head start homes and settings states should ensure that their incorporate strategies to reach children in all of these require states to incorporate or developmentally appropriate early learning approaches programs strategies in their plans covering the full spectrum from birth age as best practices emerge states should have to share information with other require states to include a system for the full range of early learning and child providers and administrators including specific training meeting the needs of diverse learners training of teachers child learning providers will be critical to the success of a quality early learning system this includes targeted professional development related to the and needs of diverse learners teachers sometimes erroneous assumptions that students with diverse learning cannot learn in the mainstream classroom and do not see as capable of effectively teaching them when these needs specifically addressed through training teachers can change belief systems about diverse learners and themselves which critical to effective instruction for all reward states that explicitly address early literacy in plans reading ability is the strongest individual predictor adult health status reading failure affects percent or more our children making it a major child health issue states are to increase access to quality early learning for low income and disadvantaged children then improving readiness skills for those children who are at risk of failure should be part of the overall state plan this include enabling states to use funds to support appropriate programs that provide differentiated instruction diverse reward states that develop partnerships with a variety stakeholders in order to increase access quality early learning programs these stakeholders should but not be limited to early care and education and early providers health providers that serve children foundations other local nonprofits parental engagement strategies should be a prominent component in state reward states that incorporate into their plans requirements collaboration between early childhood and elementary educators well as child care providers this collaboration would help mutual understanding of critical instructional priorities challenges at each age and grade and foster a broader sense shared responsibility and accountability for development thank you again for the opportunity to provide comments feel to contact me directly with any laura executive nemours phyllis june at on behalf of vulnerable young children and their families irving harris foundation would like to thank the administration for its leadership and investments in childhood development and learning we are grateful for opportunity to submit comments on how best to implement the learning challenge fund elcf to support the development of quality early learning systems that promote development through age five your vision of creating elcf as a jointly administered program of the department education and the department of health and human demonstrates your recognition that children and families comprehensive supports to be successful the fact that elcf being funded through race to the top recognizes that children born learning and that we need to invest from birth if we want children to enter school ready to research and best practices have unequivocally shown that young children and their families need a range comprehensive services including health mental health and support in order to promote whole child development social emotional cognitive behavioral and physical the administration is aware that while there are many efforts in states to develop early learning systems and replicate model early learning programs across the country too resources have been focused on integrating comprehensive into early learning systems and developing the policies and needed to support the social emotional and mental health needs vulnerable children birth to age five and their families skills including social and emotional skills critical to ability to succeed in school and in this lack of investment in family support and mental services for young children is a major barrier to closing achievement recommendation the early learning challenge fund must place value on supporting the integration of comprehensive services in particular mental health and child trauma services within comprehensive early learning system by incenting states to the development of a comprehensive system the elcf will the creation of a system that results in stronger families efficient resource allocation and better outcomes for it is critical that the elcf help states align and critical early learning programs and services such as child head head start and preschool and develop infrastructure to support a high quality system that is accountable for helping children develop the skills necessary succeed a high quality early learning system must also however a range of other comprehensive services children families need to thrive a high quality system should developmentally appropriate mental health screening and treatment services along the promotion prevention treatment continuum it must link to health systems and other federal programs that strengthen ability to their healthy development such as nutrition services and maternal child health initiatives in meaningful the elcf is in a position to help states better leverage integrate existing funding streams and programs to create a seamless high quality system of services that optimizes for young children and families but it will require that administration place a value in the rfp to support the integration of comprehensive we would like to encourage you to award points to states incorporate the development of an integrated system that the health and mental health needs of very young children and families and includes the provision of high quality mental intervention and child trauma treatment services that promote learning and child development these services might include health consultation to early learning programs and the delivery treatment services for children exposed violence the elcf rfp should require that these services delivered by and supported providers and that services should be fully integrated into a comprehensive learning research demonstrates that no matter how good the early program children who are stressed traumatized or unable regulate their emotions and behaviors will be unable to succeed school nobel laureate economist james heckman and others point the importance of executive function including regulation motivation perseverance and ability to work others to human capital development their research shows that is these social and emotional skills that translate into greatest benefits for the individual and to society any effort redress the huge achievement gap in this country must begin smart and effective investments in very young social emotional development through strengthening and appropriate prevention and intervention services into learning we want to thank you for considering these comments and would forward to discussing them with you further thank you for leadership on early childhood development learning and we look forward to working with you to make this phyllis executive the irving harris joe june at the institute for child success located in greenville carolina is grateful to the departments of education and and human services for the opportunity given to organizations individuals across the united states to make comments on recently announced race to the learning challenge competition we believe that the federal focus in this program on our youngest children is a sign of hope for our country a reason for optimism for our future and indication that the obama priorities are aligned to achieve the biggest bang for our taxpayer bucks in period of deficits and fiscal despite these great hopes and our significant interest in success of this program we are saddened by the recent decision our superintendent of education mick zais to not these federal dollars on behalf of south children hope that the legislation might be amended or regulations in phases of race to the top might be rewritten to allow organizations or collaboratives of local or governments to make applications when state authorities choose to do so for purely political reasons we believe that children and south taxpayers deserve opportunity to access federal dollars that could improve our early learning we wish also to associate ourselves with the comments of guernsey bridget hamre et al in their letter of june drs jones and colleen bridger phd mph executive joe waters associate institute for child greenville south judy june at the center for the study of social policy cssp applauds the administration for its commitment to early learning as secretaries know parents are a first teacher as such recommend that the race to the top early learning include a strategic priority to support parents in primary role and engage them as and leaders on a decade of state experiences cssp offers the approach as a framework and resource for states achieve this goal through five protective factors are the foundation of the families o parental o social o concrete support in times of o knowledge of parenting and child o social and emotional competence of research supports the notion that these protective factors reduce the likelihood of child abuse and and promote optimal child development horton more than states are incorporating the strengthening families approach engage parents as leaders and strengthen quality by forging stronger relationships with parents and common language and promote collaboration across early programs and agencies emerging evidence suggests that strengthening families approach is contributing to higher and positive outcomes for example douglass rost et given strengthening widespread reach and the evidence of its impact we respectfully recommend that the reward and encourage states to incorporate the families approach into their vision and goals for a high comprehensive early learning o strengthening families supports quality and offers low innovations for all early learning settings field has identified small but significant changes in everyday that make a difference for families these program strategies also hallmarks of quality for example they align to accreditation criteria established by the national association the education of young children states like alaska kansas others are using available resources such as child care dollars and child abuse prevention funds coupled with administrative levers like subsidy contracts requirements and technical assistance to infuse the factors framework at little or no additional cost to o strengthening families promotes school readiness by readiness emerging evidence associates families with improvements in the skills relationships confidence parents need to be effective advocates for children rost et al as states like illinois and demonstrate strengthening families offers a model for with parents at the program and system level to create initiative in which families help design that work for o the protective factors can inform quality ratings professional development systems like idaho more than a states are incorporating the strengthening families factors into their qris quality indicators idahostars strengthening families as a quality standard requires training

partners in state applications for george june at your point is well taken as part of the birth grade continuum or continuity of care services i saw no specific mention of time in the preliminary linda june at i am writing to express support for the race to the learning challenge grant that your departments will jointly administering i applaud your leadership and efforts too long care and early learning have been treated as programs ignoring the research and creating a silo approach allows too many children to fall through the cracks and arrive school unprepared it is critical that when we talk about learning that both federal departments lead the i believe that when you look at th grade test scores and see great majority of children scoring below grade level it is not failure alone of the elementary grades but an indication of readiness of children from families to start school par with their more economically advantaged peers why it important to ensure that all children have access to quality learning settings especially those from while learning begins at home it is also true that women are the workforce in greater numbers than ever before more than million children spend an average of hours per week in some of child care setting head start early head start state and early intervention programs like idea part c or idea are critically important but we cannot ignore the millions children in child care they spend too much time in these to deny that they are the primary early learning environment the goal of increasing the number and of and disadvantaged children in each age group infants toddlers and preschoolers who are enrolled in quality early learning programs cannot be achieved unless care is part of the solution not some child care but all child care how states will improve the quality of child should be part of the new i have several recommendations related to improving the quality child care that i hope you will consider in drafting comprehensive approach to developing integrated high quality learning systems in the states these require states to include parents and parent involvement in requirements require states to have comprehensive education programs such as statewide child care resource referral only include states that license and inspect all child only include states that ensure child care teachers have training to do their only include states that conduct comprehensive clearances on child care program only include states that have comprehensive birth to strategies that include comprehensive early learning guidelines all age groups ensure that these guidelines apply to all and only include states with comprehensive quality improvement systems that address all of the early care and settings in the state including family child care homes include parents and parent involvement as a cornerstone of planning research has shown that parental involvement communication is linked to the quality of provided communication between mother and caregivers is with more sensitive interactions between the caregiver and other studies have found links between frequency or degree communication and the observed quality of caregiving environment as measured by observational tools such the early childhood environment rating scale and o recommendation require states to include parents and involvement in the requirements at a minimum states should policies that require parent involvement in the programs to that parents are provided with notices of licensing require violations and complaints to be posted online and programs regularly communicate with o recommendation child care resource and referral should be a part of any race to the top grant they are the between parents and the community they interact annually millions of parents and providers of all types they not only parents find child care but they also provide information parents so that parents can make more informed choices among care all children whose child care is paid with public funds be in licensed programs that offer at least a minimum level quality learning opportunities the child care and block grant ccdbg is the law that sets the parameters for in setting their own state child care laws however the currently allows federal funds to be spent on programs providers that are not licensed inspected background checked trained as a result child care laws vary greatly throughout states state standards are only as good as the enforcement those standards yet state inspection policies vary greatly of the states or more conduct an inspection only once a year less frequently california inspects child care centers only every five years montana inspects family child care homes once every five years michigan inspects family child care only once every years ccdbg does not require without regular unannounced inspections compliance with even highest state standards is o recommendation race to the top funds should be given only states that ensure that all children whose child care is paid public funds are in programs that meet minimum standards programs should be licensed and inspected by the state and programs regardless of setting are included in statewide to provide comprehensive early learning programs for children birth to require minimum training for all child care teachers the care workforce is largely untrained and many states do not a high school diploma let alone a college degree few require any training in early childhood development even health and safety training varies greatly among the states does not have a minimum training o recommendation include a requirement in race to the top states must address the training and preparation of all child teachers and providers who care for children paid with federal state comprehensive background clearances child care providers have a comprehensive background check including before getting a license or working in a licensed setting it no sense that only half of the states conduct a fingerprint against state and federal records only seventeen states check sex offender registry seven states do not check the child o recommendation race to the top state applications should that all adults caring for children have been properly this must include a comprehensive background check based ensure that quality rating improvement systems qris comprehensive while qris systems offer an opportunity to the quality of care and help parents understand that not all care is created equal many qris systems are not comprehensive their approach to child care they apply to licensed care which ignores the many states with high licensing thresholds state south dakota allows a family child care provider to for thirteen children before licensing is required three allow seven children idaho louisiana and ohio and seven allow six children arkansas indiana iowa mississippi jersey north dakota and far too many children are child care that is neither licensed nor o recommendation give priority to states with quality improvement systems that are comprehensive and include all of the early care and learning include only states that have comprehensive birth to five learning strategies states should have early learning for ages which means separate early learning guidelines infants and toddlers the early learning standards and child care licensing should be comparable currently child care especially infant toddler care is exempt from state early learning guidelines care should not be exempt because for millions of children it their only early learning opportunity any race to the top should integrate child care standards with state early guidelines which will help improve the quality of child o recommendation give priority to states that have birth to five strategies for all early care and learning in closing let me thank you for the opportunity to comment on race to the top program children are not born at age when attend state or head start and their learning trajectory already well established by this age race to the top provides opportunity to reward states for developing comprehensive birth five systems that also meet the needs of working parents it time to stop separating child care and early education and the to the top program provides an excellent opportunity to send message i am hopeful that strengthening the quality of all care settings will be part of any race to the top grant linda k executive leslie june at recommendations for rtt early learning alliance in washington state strongly supports aligns with the intent to give vulnerable children access early learning and hope that this opportunity serve as a lever to incentivize quality improvements in the we appreciate the opportunity to comment and offer the o points should be awarded to states that have comprehensive for the development of a strong early learning system that linkages across health mental health nutrition oral health family supports these plans should provide a framework and for the state and should have a plan for accountability and adjustments as work progresses with clear involvement of early learning advisory o while we believe that quality rating and improvement qris are integral to systemic quality improvement we that improving access to in states is more than a single system we encourage the elc to consider a range states in development of their qris systems and encourage that choose to focus on quality improvements particularly in aptitude and skills of the early learning workforce the guidelines should reward points to states that are working on creating career pathways that lead to adequately compensated professionals states should also incentivized to create qris systems that benefit all early caregivers including family friend and neighbor o the elc opportunity should provide clear prompting for states ensure that as an integral part of quality all children served in culturally responsive ways that recognize the full of diversity in a state including racial ethnic cultural linguistic strengths inclusive of children with o points should be awarded to states that are coordinating and federally funded home visiting programs as an integrated of the early learning system considering them as part of identified birth to three o the elc should reward states that are working on p linking prek with the k system as part of efforts states should have birth to age eight early guidelines that are aligned with qris and serve as a framework and resource for parents and providers across the o the elc should incentivize family engagement by requiring to spend a significant portion of the grant to promote involvement in early learning thank you for the opportunity to comment on this exciting charlie anne and lee june at comments regarding guideline development on the early learning challenge program offers a great opportunity learn and continuously improve state and community efforts to strong early learning systems that can increase overall readiness and success and reduce disparities in outcomes by race language and this requires an approach to evaluation that continually keeps eye on the ultimate goal of improving readiness for success in school and that recognizes the multiple supports and quality services that need to be developed to this end grantees will need continuous feedback and expertise to make corrections and continuously and expand upon their the build initiative has developed an evaluation framework systems building work that is based upon a theory of change systems building one which has defined testable and assumptions within that theory in the case of evaluating programmatic efforts program evaluation methodologies randomized controlled trials and other techniques to counterfactuals that enable attributions of causality and should be used where possible and complex programmatic interventions that are interactive operate several levels or have emphases that beyond specific program participants however require evaluation approaches different evaluation methodologies also needed in the case of developing strong planning and structures to ensure fidelity of implementation according to building political will to move forward and secure needed and creating connections and collaborations different programs serving the same children and families produce synergy in impact and moving to a scale of activity achieves results on a population further in order to enable continuous learning and such evaluation processes need to be interactive and ideally embedded into the design and operation of the overall framework for evaluation is based upon its theory of and describes five focus areas for evaluation each amenable rigorous evaluation although requiring different o context improving the political environment including understanding of key stakeholders and the cultivating of so that it produces the policy changes and support to system building o components establishing programs and within the system that achieve specific impacts upon children families essential to achieving

individual program component o infrastructure developing the ongoing support systems management accountability and continuous learning systems function effectively and with quality o scale ensuring a comprehensive system is available to children and their families based upon specific need to broad and inclusive results at the population entire state community level the build initiative has found that the presence and of an evaluation partner within the planning and activities has been extremely useful to build states evaluation expertise which can provide technical assistance advice as planning occurs results in clearer articulation of and expectations and ways to measure progress in enable continuous adjustments and improvements based experience such interactive evaluation not only evaluations to be truly helpful to grantees also improves the quality of evaluations one of the goals of the early learning challenge fund is to chart pathways to success that other states and communities follow to do so requires continuous evaluation and determination of what processes as well as discrete produce results this requires an approach to and investment evaluation that is different from traditional evaluation in federal in short we would strongly recommend that the guidelines for the early learning challenge fund incorporate a section evaluation that goes beyond traditional evaluations o stresses the importance of adopting a comprehensive framework that covers context components infrastructure and o emphasizes interactive evaluation as a primary approach o

writing to our support for the million investment in grants to states improve early childhood services and submit recommendations for state applications for the race to the top early learning grant the provides a unique opportunity for selected states develop innovative systems for delivering early childhood and supports to infants toddlers and preschoolers way supports the position that the application rigorous and competitive we also recommend that assistance meetings be held with the support of national to assist states in developing applications that clearly the priorities outlined in the competition like race to the top we believe this competition should state leadership receives input and support from local in the development of their applications that states and communities use data to guide and to engage broader community and that states identify strategies to address the needs of children and families who most early childhood services and supports are delivered at community level county city school district head etc and local capacity for implementing the reform system and policy is essential to additionally communities need data about the developmental of young children to inform the development of effective and build public and political will for increased investments that end we make the following recommendations for the race to top early learning challenge measures of school readiness the should incentives to encourage states to use a measure school readiness that includes physical health and social competence emotional maturity language and literacy general knowledge and communication a measure school readiness will provide critical data about the percentage children who are vulnerable and thriving by community deeper and broader public engagement on the importance of childhood while informing planning state level stakeholder leadership and advisement states well established state early childhood advisory councils should given priority in the competition and the state council should be involved in the development of the community level stakeholder leadership and advisement with established local early childhood advisory councils should given priority for funding the early childhood councils provide input into the state plan and a letter of support would included as part of the application in states without local childhood advisory councils the newly designated home communities and head start programs through the head start collaboration office should provide input and letters of state governance states should be required to demonstrate all state agencies with jurisdiction over early including the state departments of education of human and of health have been involved in the development of application and consent to it all applicants should be required show progress in achieving a unified governance approach for learning systems and services as a result of this partnerships states should demonstrate partnerships among child care and early programs medical providers businesses foundations organizations and other stakeholders involved in and supportive early childhood family engagement states should demonstrate a plan for parents and families into early childhood services and them on the importance of proper care for infants and under five years of quality early learning states should demonstrate they have plan for using implementing and linking early learning program standards and practitioner standards connected developmentally appropriate curriculum and assessment for birth to five early learning linkages from birth to five to k states should linkages of early education services with curriculum and in schools and school districts to ensure that young children able to seamlessly transition to the k system they further demonstrate linkages of a data system supporting learning with the k longitudinal data united ways across the country have invested significant volunteer support and advocacy to advance early childhood at the state and local level we understand that transforming childhood services and supports into high quality systems that consistently

that all children start ready to learn founded by the early childhood collaborative and supported by more than foundations build championed a systemic approach creating early childhood that respond to child health nutrition mental health support and early care and education needs across all services supports for young children and their families we believe that early learning challenge elc with its on innovation and systemic approaches to policy change a critical step toward realizing the dream of all succeeding and is a use of public funds that achieve positive outcomes for we offer the following comments based on our decade of with state early childhood pioneers and anchored in what we learned working hand in hand with state policymakers in hopes it might serve as a useful reference for this exciting o we strongly support the focus on giving vulnerable access to early care and education this emphasis especially timely given the progress that states are making quality rating and improvement systems qris which build helping states use as a powerful lever for systems reform guidelines should promote qris practice and policies ensure the most vulnerable children have access to participating and progressing in the qris while the component of qris continues to be an important consumer tool we encourage the majority of focus and resources in states be on quality improvement providing states the opportunity to strategies for supporting the and capabilities of the early childhood o points should be awarded to states that have a clear plan to qris as a framework to reward better quality teachers and administrative practices to complete learning standards and to align them with the program standards qris and to link training credentialing and development resources to qris levels so that there is transparency and accountability for teacher quality we offer resources to the administration the research papers case and other materials on quality improvement that are available our qris national learning network web site httpaddr as well as those httpaddr o several build states including minnesota michigan and illinois are implementing strategies to help all types of providers including family friend and neighbor ffn care benefit from the supports and resources available under qris care serves huge number of disadvantaged children we cannot them out of the picture points should be awarded to states can demonstrate a commitment to utilizing the infrastructures supports under qris to benefit all types of early care education providers parents choose care settings based on variety of criteria and circumstance children in all types settings should have access to high quality early experiences and in all types of should be supported with quality improvement strategies o includes getting different programs and to work together better build also suggests giving weight states committed to strengthening connections across all childhood services and supports including healthy development mental health nutrition medical home and supports such as home visiting points should be awarded to that can show they are thinking comprehensively and that demonstrate strong linkages across systems such as referral mechanisms aligned data systems and shared goals training o the elc should incentivize states to place a greater focus serving all of our children including those from diverse linguistic ethnic and racial backgrounds states should have explicit focus on serving dual language learners and should definitions of quality that include attention to racial cultural and language diversity as well as to meeting the needs children with o early childhood governance and coordination is crucial to effective early childhood system we believe that the guidelines should emphasize the need for states to unify and for coordination of early childhood and policies as well as to empower early childhood councils to take a lead role in guiding and advising systems development elc applications should require endorsement of the ecac chairs who should play an role in planning the application proposal and implementation those states with strong early childhood comprehensive projects under the mchb should also be given weight states demonstrate a clear commitment to building a robust early leadership cadre at the local regional level should awarded additional points as should states that partnerships for administration and provision early childhood leadership services and the early learning challenge provides states with a opportunity to build on the great work they have been doing build and other national support organizations to both and deepen their approach to creating whole child policies help all children succeed the elcg funding will help states up and demonstrate impact from the exemplary systems work underway the states that have been part of build az il mi nj ny oh pa and wa have truly been pioneers in

know or teaching thier children at home because they did not get education they need to teach their own children there are good teachers in the program who puts their heart and soul into and give all they have and more so these children that walks these classroom doors to learn and be ready to set the world fire through the knowledge of a good teacher we need our to get the best of the education possible to make better for our glendelia june at the race to the top early learning challenge is exciting collaboration between the department of education ed health and human services this competition can help the gap of strengthening families to connecting to the education pipeline by supporting early learning programs prepare young children to enter school ready to the initiative is a step in the right direction texas did not apply for the rttt funding in if the does not apply for this round of funding organizations such avance one of the oldest largest and most childhood education programs in the country not have a chance to compete for much needed funding to serve most vulnerable families in the state of texas consequently children and families will be at a greater how can organizations like avance compete for early dollars if texas does not apply is it possible to set apart of the funding and open up the competition to organizations such avance that has a proven track record of providing high early learning in all key areas of child development cognitive social emotional and physical development for the education pipeline does not begin at or kindergarten begins at birth a critical years are during the years birth to age three there is a critical need for learning particularly in economically disadvantaged children from low income and low literacy families are not ready learn at or kindergarten and if disadvantaged children not receive early learning they will never have a chance to school ready to learn or catch up to their since avance has continued to provide innovative and family support services to predominantly hispanic families communities dedicated to promoting readiness and supporting family engagement avance proudly as a national model and best practice of early childhood for vulnerable families over the years avance has demonstrated that children who graduate from avance as toddlers school ready when they transition into a school system have promotion rates to the next grade level have high rates and outperform their peers on state standardized additionally parents who graduate from the parent program increase their sense of parental efficacy enhance view that they are their first teacher become more in their development and learning and increase knowledge and skills many parent graduates also continue their education thus helping to break the cycle of hispanics are the fastest growing minority population in the states and research shows that hispanics are far less likely earn a high school diploma than african americans and their counterparts if the state of texas does not apply for this could have negative implications for development quality of workforce preparedness and our national security if the education gap persists high rates poverty will continue and can lead to other societal please consider setting aside some of the million of the funds for organizations such as avance that are making a positive difference in the lives of many children help us help you to build the bridge that can close achievement gap among most vulnerable glendelia m zavala ed chief program avance san antonio lisa june at i agree with all the ben said such recommendation certain common definitions are needed to state system to facilitate the development of integrated state early systems we believe that early learning communities within state need to use the same definitions therefore we recommend following child refers to an individual from birth until the day individual enters means a child whose family income meets eligibility for the child care and development fund ccdf defined by the state or a child who meets head start and early start eligibility disadvantaged refers to those populations included in eligibility for ccdf services or those populations which are start and early head start eligible these populations children with special needs language minority children in protective services children who are experiencing and other special early learning program is defined as early childhood program as provided in the higher education lisa head start christina june at especially

trackbacks category creativity in the box innovation innovation looking for ideas in all the wrong email this posted by renee hopkins part of a series from the paper looking for ideas all the wrong places an argument for staying in the box by smith ishmael and renee hopkins why staying in the box is a good although staying in the box is not a widely used approach it is a highly respected one one of the leading experts creative thinking had this to say about idea generation as many of might define there are far too many practitioners out there who believe creativity is just brainstorming and being free to suggest ideas creative thinking is different from normal thinking it not just normal thinking that is more if we suspend judgment feel innocent and childlike and try use the right side of the brain should we not then be creative will certainly be more creative than before but not very much we will be able to use our natural creativity natural creativity is not very it is not enough to be innocent and uninhibited and to have creative attitude the normal behavior of the brain in perception to set up routine patterns and to follow these in order to across patterns we can use deliberate techniques techniques can be learned practiced and used serious creativity dr edward de creativity inside the as dr de bono states we will be creative at least to a degree if allow ourselves free reign to come up with whatever sounds unique original in this way we will usually come up with a few new innovative ideas but by staying in the box we force our brains acknowledge reality and we dig down beyond the obvious in this we will come up with greater numbers of ideas and these ideas will not only new and innovative they will also be more likely to within our when we venture outside the box the lack of constraints actually work to our detriment if we are given permission to wander and the constraints of the business the result can be lots of ideas span a very broad range but that are shallow and not in the past few years trading spaces has been one of most popular reality shows in america what was it that made the so irresistible to viewers was it the creativity of the designs or drastic nature of the makeovers in part yes but if those were only reasons why shows such as designing for the sexes homes across america just as what truly set trading spaces apart was the fact that every one those amazing transformations was the result of creative thinking took place inside a the design budget was held to the timeframe in which to create the new look was limited to the work was done by one designer one carpenter and because the teams were forced to work within the constraints of time and resources their designs were much more innovative than they had been allowed the freedom to change the shape of the box ignore it altogether do you really think we would have chandeliers made of tree branches sprayed with silver paint and with christmas tree lights if the homeowners had been given mastercard represents another example of creativity inside the box a good portion of the s visa was the undisputed leader in credit card industry in large part due to its and they american express campaign the ads were designed to appeal desires to experience the best in life to reach a level achievement beyond that which most people could ever hope to enjoy sort of a mastercard on the other hand had launched five different campaigns within a decade none of which had provided the brand anything it could claim as its own so the company took a step and examined the box in which it lived then it created a that built on the virtues of that box the priceless rather than positioning itself as the card that could give people lifestyles of the rich and famous it focused on enhancing the of every day lives the annual report to the positioning as the better way to pay for everything matters as a result there were transactions around the world in

hopkins part of a series from the paper looking for ideas all the wrong places an argument for staying in the box by smith ishmael and renee hopkins decaysmalljpg many issues are still debated when it comes to product innovation but fortunately marketers and product seem to have stopped debating the issue of whether or not important to keep the product and service development pipelines this is critically important study after study has demonstrated new product and service success is relatively rare such as the dun and bradstreet study in which the accompanying chart was found the chart indicates for every profitable new product there approximately sixty ideas or concepts that do not make it to much has been said regarding the importance of having a repeatable process for new product and service development such as dr robert cooper and his colleagues have spent countless laboring on defining exactly what such a development process look like resulting in charts now familiar to many new yet even dr cooper has expect a new product process to make up for shortage of quality ideas if the idea was mundane to start count on your process turning it into a star optimizing process what best practice companies are doing part cooper r edgett s kleinschmidt e so while not much debate that success in the idea stage or fuzzy front end as often called is critical to the success of new product development and innovation program still a deal of discussion about why the fuzzy front end is such a part of the product or service development process perhaps this because unlike other portions of the development process more has been spent in this sort of discussion compared to the small amount of time that has been spent defining how to make the front end more efficient and productive or perhaps because of notion that ideas are just supposed to appear customers or employees or from some corporate initiative people to be creative and our experience that it is possible to structure the fuzzy end in such a way that it not only produces innovative results that those results can positively affect the entire next part the goal of the fuzzy front technorati innovation ideas

thunderbird innovation challenge am a judge as well but the chief judge for the final and has served as chief framing architect for the official challenge critical to frame innovation challenges correctly because if you be able to generate actionable ideas instead get the blue sky stuff that gives creativity a bad name because so far out either not feasible or just plain not paper is well worth reading in its entirety the in framing an innovation challenge you construct tactical maps that lay out the strategic identify the primary detail and appropriately link together secondary also try not to muddy the challenge with excess positioning or constraints or elements that should be reserved for use evaluation criteria for possible framing is a part of the innovation process that often gets because not nearly as sexy as idea generation or solutions but absolutely critical because almost to be focused enough to come up with actionable solutions when we begin a new client project we hold what we call an meeting either in person or by phone before the meeting distribute to the stakeholders a list of questions written aims to get at the information we need to frame the issue understand exactly where we need to focus the ideation and give us information we need to evaluate the ideas and guide us toward the actionable solutions paper will give us valuable insight

from the big moo about the power of dumb saying the solution to current ills is not creativity less his point imitation across industries more efficient and effective than creativity and many novel ideas are simply irrelevant says he which i disagree with however while unfettered creativity can to irrelevance unfettered imitation can lead to endless repetition the sake of repetition and the kind of incremental that results in varieties of oreos in the cookie there is immense energy behind imitation but it in using four broad ideas that rothenberg says have been copied over and over a template the energy behind imitation comes in recombination and in analogy inventive recombination means new energy by putting things together that were never put before analogy means tapping into the very logic of the between two things to see if that logical structure can be in a new this is not less creative more creative but less provocative than saying that the most powerful idea is a comments category innovation video ipod business model email this posted by renee hopkins a lot has been written about unveiling of new capability for the ipod the best look at the new introduction as business model innovation is this article by the new york david article points out that the new video avoids overshooting consumer need steve jobs has said many that people just consume music and movies the same many times do you watch a movie so apple sidestepped the issue altogether the new ipod comes ready to play short movies videos and certain abc television not feature films none these items lose much when not on a big wide incorporates innovative pricing that will drive consumer trial tv show is a brilliant price low enough to be an impulse buy when for example you missed an episode it high enough to you to using bit torrent or another illegal download source but high enough to bring in some extra income to the tv avoids overshooting consumer need you watch video doing something else sales of a candle to sales of music ipods this issue became moot because apple simply added video to the existing ipod not a model called the ipod video just that the regular ipod with new even thinner shape is now capable of playing video instead thinking of it as a more limited ipod think of it as an with greater just in case comments category innovation influences on the acceptance of product email this posted by renee hopkins this article from the american marketing newsletter national culture influences acceptance of product innovation sparked a discussion in our office today the article reports research that was intended to determine how consumers in countries respond to product introductions a new product might rapid acceptance in one country but not in to cut to the chase the results of the study showed that exerts a relatively high level of overall influence on diffusion than of the diffusion rates can be attributed to influence and that the cultural aspects of masculinity and distance are positively associated with diffusion rates and dimensions of individualism and orientation are related to diffusion the discussion we had centered on the difference between acceptance innovation and diffusion of innovation this article seems to use words interchangeably and always thought they were the same my colleague has said not once had a chance to it further report the other part of the discussion centered around the that a new innovation would do better if introduced into a culture as opposed to a more individualistic said colleague by its very nature a collective culture tends not to individualistic things and often innovations fall into my response was assuming that the action of a diffusion process is get the innovation to a tipping point maybe that tipping point easier to get to in a collective culture if in a collective the opinion leaders are more quickly followed than in individualistic culture then it makes sense that the tipping point which the adoption curve would begin to grow exponentially would reached more feel free to discuss this amongst comments category innovation voice mail update one more day for email this posted

post the link to the survey has up asking people to rate the values of an innovation commons an interesting survey and its result should be a picture of the of values that would be present in the innovation commons see previous post for a definition of innovation the results here whenever they are comments category innovation an innovation email this posted by renee hopkins my friend paul schumann has for some time now been trying to together principles for an innovation commons which he this way an innovation commons is a space physical or virtual enables innovation through the mutual and interdependent creativity its members it has the following open system everyone everyone can use the members who contribute are fluid an abundant resource other names that people have used to describe this type of system open source open innovation democratic innovation innovation peer to peer smart mobs and free paul notes that some attempts to create an innovation commons succeeded and some have failed his project is to try to find out are principles of a successful innovation the discussion about this is taking place via a blog a newsletter and a survey open now you can find out about it i just finished taking the survey and i think that the principles and rules the better love it if we could get down the most basic be flexible responsible and honorable maybe are more but those three say a comments category innovation comes to those with open email this posted by renee hopkins couple of weeks ago david pollard posted on why hard to innovation servicesi recommend you read the whole thing whether you are buying or selling innovation you can gain insight this what struck me too was that one of the reasons he mentioned dovetailed with some thinking been doing for several weeks now how mental clutter affects creativity and innovation talking how difficult it is to come up with new ideas when your mind is plain stuffed full of thoughts and emotions and plans and last month i went on a vacation something rarely to do over the years instead i had perfected the concept of weekend often checking work email while gone i left this trip stressed and fatigued and feeling as though i probably had an original idea in months i had a mind full of emotional i needed to let go of around things that had happened with that were over and done with i took my laptop with me because bring myself to leave it but while i was gone i never even booted it up except to photos from my digital camera i check email call the office by the fourth day of vacation i was energetic had let go of emotional baggage and was having serendipity odd random ideas about things that i had been on both personally and at obviously this is not a new concept one reason people longer vacations and sabbaticals but consider the waste of potential if an entire company gets into the state i was in when left for so the connection to post he says one innovation is hard to sell is because it requires understanding of and why the market has moved on without you there is so much in one statement pollard is saying that being open for requires an understanding that whatever you have been doing in the has failed and i would add it also requires that you manage to go of the emotions generated by this letting go is not often encouraged in our professional lives rewarded for hanging on staying with something seeing it through we make a mistake and we are not suitably and demonstrably upset it we run the risk of being seen as not taking things perhaps in order to be truly open to innovation mind again we have to be willing to let go of a lot of things have to be willing to clear enough of on our minds to create open space for new ideas and to recognize them when others bring to comments category innovation cost of not email this posted by renee hopkins great post over on heads up on organizational innovation the cost of not author ruth ann describes as what happens when you innovate but your does and the estimated dollar value your competitors have gained that you have failed to capture through your own innovation sounds simple but why important according to hattori simple roi can never truly measure innovation because it does account for the lost opportunities such as missing the phone kodak missing the digital camera and the radio companies blinked while sony brought the walkman to been to lot of conferences and read lots of articles formulas for innovation roi have been presented but this is the time seen it approached this way and it makes perfect my first impression is that you could only convince a company of in hindsight or if you were trying to convince them in general to more innovative what would be great is if you could find a way convince a company of this before the opportunity was lost and how would you frame the case for spending the money to innovate this concept before the fact and not after one way would be determine customer pain points that your industry could identify ways of addressing them and then do competitive and swot analysis on all of your competitors and and have no way of researching companies and flying under your radar by the time you found out if a competitor was in the process of launching a product that would be threat be too far so maybe better to use the concept of the cost of not as a general inducement to pick up the innovation pace in any hattori is looking for examples of the cost of not if you have any add them to the post comments category innovation innovation initiative

definition as as the definition suggests this report explores how america practiced innovation in the past suggests that innovation has been driver for the rise of the american economy explores the recent shifts in where how and why innovation occurs and recommendations for how we can focus as a society on what we do probably not surprising that i would find this idea innovation has been what

different according to teresa author of inventing beauty a history of the innovations that made us beautiful invention is a matrix a zeitgeist phenomenon mothered by necessity but by luxury nyt reviewer penelope says that riordan describes invention as a great bubbling up similar ideas at the same time born from a culture of abundance and that is indeed a fascinating reminder that how invention characterized depends quite a bit on what inventions are being at if looking at light bulbs and automobiles maybe you think of invention as born of necessity however if you are looking brassieres and nail polish the necessity metaphor begins to if you need more proof that necessity always the mother invention riordan points out that vibrators were the fifth device introduced in the

kind of serendipity here lately come across posts that take a critical look at the cultural that copying is not only bad bad innovation not so say malcolm gladwell had a fascinating piece in the nov yorker detailing his experience at having one of his plagiarized by playwright briony lavery in her broadway frozen after talking with lavery and reading free culture gladwell ends up coming down against he calls the plagiarism the final dishonesty of the plagiarism fundamentalists is encourage us to pretend that these chains of influence and do not exist and that a words have a virgin birth and eternal life i suppose i could get upset about what happened to words i could also simply acknowledge that i had a good long with that let it meanwhile on nov over at the sift experiment blog heigh offered this take on copying and innovation via guns germs and if half the challenge of innovation is communicating its value someone else is always innovating then building creative teams not be nearly as efficient as building widely cast sifting technologies to scour the universe for innovation and blueprinting those technologies for use at home as says complex innovations are best borrowed not built technology begets technology the value of diffusion often the value of original and with all this churning around in my head while cleaning out email inbox i came across one of joyce organizational innovation newsletters from last august that an article from peter managing change newsletter on the distinction between innovation and cheating the of the issue a new service process or product that improves upon current service process or product is seen as an innovation from perspective of the company that has produced it but is seen cheating from the perspective of the company whose service process product was the one improved upon de all businesses are threatened by innovation how do we respond it by seeing innovation as unfair competition and wasting in legal battles that inevitably fail or by accepting that world changes and then deciding we are best served by finding own in every case the end result is an affirmation of the value of an society that put unnecessary limits on recombination in art in technology or in business while allowing for enough authorship rights that creators and inventors artists can make a living this is of course not the kind of society are living in but it seems that increasing numbers of people trying to get us comments category innovation email this posted by renee hopkins business week is devoting its entire oct issue its anniversary issue to the innovation economy a of stuff here covering pretty much the entire space copyright the management of innovation global innovation and forth all of it is accessible free online you go business my take overall is that this is though when you read articles carefully still more of a focus and not as much innovation throughout the company see the doblin of innovation for more on this here are the articles i found the most building an idea an examination of innovation as a management process though still focused on the innovation of product and service offerings andrew hargadon henry chesbrough and christensen each of whom has seen a lot of ideaflow pixels devoted their this article discusses the old idea of innovation experimentation willingness to fail and setting big goals as as some of the new ideas opening company procedures and research the outside and tapping expertise in product and one great quote innovation nowadays is more like improvisation jazz than playing out a score already written karl ronn president o how to sharpen the innovative a quote from this commentary by michael j part of the difficulty in identifying the right policy is that innovation economy has many moving parts the universities big companies small startups stock market investors each has a distinct role and has gone global bringing in even more there is one guidepost amid the confusing trends the enormous surprising success of the american innovation machine in years in the late s and the early s virtually all forecasters wrote off the us as a mature laggard eventually would be passed by more vibrant economies in europe japan yet when the internet revolution arrived it was entrepreneurs who proved far more nimble and adept in ideas into products the result was a productivity boom that still barreling again more of a focus here on innovation of new products service offerings than innovation plan for how governments and can invest for the take advantage of the global provide the right protection for ip the right protection that which provides a proper balance between too much and enough protection of ip something we all dream of yet no one has figured out how to emphasize innovation as a high priority politically though could also say this needs to happen in businesses and as industry and academia weigh this one features an interview with sam palmisano of ibm and clough of georgia tech who are heading up something called national innovation initiative which i was not aware of the interview is longer than available in print i was interested in the nii itself though and if you are too you can out more about it scouring the planet for this all about global cooperation and innovation networks fallacy of innovation was that it was all about spending on information technology says diana farrell director of the global institute instead it has more to do with execution getting products out better and again too much of a focus on product innovation but a discussion on innovation networks about which much has been collaborative innovation and suggests that historical ability to conduct business borders will help the european union ratchet up its innovation comments category innovation strategy first define the email this posted by renee hopkins in response to this post on execution and strategy vangundy for me ideation and execution need to be driven by strategy stems from visions with a colleague and i have preparing for an ideation session with a large financial firm on the east coast we start out with a list of questions have key managers respond to i then synthesize all of those distill them into a short list of potential challenge statements the client to choose from in this case i started with statements and am now creating affinity groups we call this after all of these a decision is made on what challenges use for my point is saying all of this is that if the is to then the implementation is likely to be successful since you increase the odds of solving the problem correctly ian mitroff wrote that it is better solve the right problem incorrectly than the wrong correctly in my experience if this front end immersion is done then ideation and implementation suffer and the session can turn into a major discussion on what the real that should have been done this is true whether or not the innovation process involves a ideation session you cannot solve a problem if you are not working the problem that needs to be solved quite often the overall is how do we grow but if your company is trying to come up with new line of products to solve this growth problem when in fact needed is a new way to position the products you have this solution not likely to solve the growth the thorniest problem in all of innovation seems to be unmet needs essentially that is a process of trying first find out what you know you know then find a for comments category innovation innovation strategy and

tide of change ideaflow very quiet hopefully the major changes are over and the quiet on monday i returned to my desk after a trip found in my email this quote from the daily fast company impressions companies that rely too heavily on creativity flame out anderson founder yankee well that got my attention not the least because it describes a new direction like to take ideaflow over the next months that direction is away from creativity and idea generation and of themselves and toward a discussion of innovation as it strategy and execution and as it also helps develop strategy i went to the fast company article the quote came from if so smartsteve jobs apple and the limits of innovation and a look the article spends a fair amount of time on regarding business practices and other innovative failures such as xerox parc not interested in rehashing but what i did get interested in was the rest of quote from above the whole thing companies that rely too heavily on creativity flame out in ways execution is more important apple is innovative but what this says to me is that creativity and innovation per se are always that important the innovation process must start further back uncovering unmet customer needs and figuring out how to meet them figuring out what will meet these unmet needs is more of a than it looks if a company comes up with a new product to meet consumer need and it turns out that what will best meet that need some kind of customer service process innovation instead then that company is barking up the wrong innovation this to me is the strategy and

a survey are invited to take because this survey focuses on innovation please only respond if you are in an organization with least employees thanks more specific information about the survey from the gist joyce most of us involved in innovation believe that trust is necessary ongoing significant innovation efforts while it is easy to that trust is needed it is not so easy to understand exactly what means in pursuing innovation in your organizations you have experienced many situations where trust between colleagues between individuals and their management or at the organzational was a factor in behavior or unlike the hard data that can be captured about the impact of a product development process the impact of trust or lack tends to be intuitive perceived and captured anecdotally in endeavor to gain a sense of the social agreement or perception about the importance of trust we have created a which we would like for you to respond to at the link shown we believe your views as practitioners of innovation will particularly enlightening in understanding this important but fuzzy thanks again for your joyce wycoff ruth ann hattori charlie prather kathie innovationnetwork and the global innovation study group comments category innovation innovation project open to email this posted by renee hopkins very pleased to have been asked by joyce wycoff to innovation a new collaborative innovation project sponsored by innovation network joyce started her life here on ideaflow and the blog for innovation is the th launched since the start of i feel like a proud some info about the new project whose blog home is httpaddr do you know the fundamentals of innovation those culture traits and activities that are essential to the success any innovation the past two years have seen an explosion of information innovation new models new software systems new in some jeopardy of being sunk by all this seemingly contradictory information before we can actually put into innovation a new collaborative learning process initiated the innovationnetwork and by other organizations in field of innovation has taken on the challenge of articulating critical fundamentals of innovation this multidisciplinary international study will focus on defining terms fundamental practices identifying leading success indicators outlining the critical process phases of innovation and

for email this posted by renee hopkins last year i helped judge the first thunderbird global challenge results indicate it was a success event sponsors advancing some of the concepts that they received from last competition byu has developed an innovation course as part of curriculum making it mandatory for all students in the class participate in the innovation challenge and dial a sponsor hosts their own competition modeled on the innovation the organizers are now looking for innovation challenge sponsors the competition this would be a very cool opportunity innovative companies because the sponsors actually get to pose problem the mba students will work on solving so you end up with of ideas from top mba students and a look at the kind of work they this year the competition is expanding into more increasing the amount of participating teams and shortening the product plan submission from pages to one the sponsor deadline is july if interested take a at the sponsorship

its new product yesterday i saw how the lack of a defined process or a defined new product development process holds up development of new ideas into new product we were having a session debrief meeting with a for whom been working and i heard one of our clients say had lots of ideas but never got to concept stage with them corrected we concepted the ideas but we never tested them and forward with how does a company decide to move forward with a new product whatever they do there must be an internal evaluation period hopefully some market research testing and forecasting companies that have a defined process for doing these things have the edge over companies that have to make it up from scratch single listening to my clients talking yesterday made me realize that trying to keep the momentum going when you have a process place must be incredibly difficult and our client was not a company they are not a company that routinely introduces new but like to be in order to get there they need to get processes in place not what we do for clients but easier to work with clients who do already have this framework comments category innovation on email this posted by renee hopkins

email this posted by renee hopkins i posted recently on assertion that policies operate to the interests of the creative class are in the interests of the rest of the nation as well an article stepen malanga that calls into question entire thesis that in order to attract highly innovative businesses and the creative class that typically staffs businesses cities must put their emphasis and tax dollars creating the kind of atmosphere in which the creative class wants live which according to florida includes a vibrant recreational amenities and a social climate that celebrates malanga essentially says florida is the emperor with no clothes most cities in fact underperform the economy and actually do a very good job of attracting or residents unless you only count the internet boom the main issue here is a classic chicken or egg argument which first the creative economy companies and workers or the socially liberal atmosphere says not only does florida believe that marginal attractions like idiosyncratic arts scene can build economic power but he that government officials and policymakers like himself can out how to produce those things artificially he seem recognize that the cultural attributes of the cities he most like san francisco and austin are not a product of planning but have been a spontaneous development financed case in point having followed austin politics and culture for years i know that the slogan austin weird something the city council started it was campaign launched by a few business leaders in south austin in effort to keep chain retail from driving out more offbeat businesses in austin the offbeat culture came first it only sense that the city would keep austin weird much to dismay of the people who actually started it as they cast about ways to stem the bleeding that was an effort to the things that seemed to have worked for austin and build on does this mean that a keep omaha weird campaign would bring lots innovative businesses to omaha according to malanga would have had to have been wierd in the first place for that to or it would have to become wierd spontaneously and not by city mandate and government comments category innovation general law innovation email this posted by renee hopkins sandy mcmurray of new apple matters blog pointed an interview with hbs professor david yoffie on hit innovation strategy and sandy says use a baseball steve jobs manages a team that is always swinging for the fences strategy relies on home runs to win if the competition hits singles and doubles or team strikes out too often memorable home runs matter much the game is fun to i read the whole interview and what struck me was how dated the approach to innovation seems these days walloping every ball for home runs makes for better stories than business successes trend is to innovation and that approach is about opposite of the approach sandy another appropriate metaphor already quoted before approach i was especially struck by the difference between comments apple and a white paper i just read innovating for cash from the handset wars which appears to be part of a strategy boston consulting group to position themselves as the to which companies should turn to manage the process on subsequent reference they refer to this as the process so pretty serious about not making fun of this my business model is based the concept as well but it seem that a company that truly represents the spirit of innovation as does would be so behind the curve on managing their processes just not the way they play the comments trackbacks category ties make for stronger email this posted by renee hopkins social networking and innovation is the subject of a stanford school study that says disparate information and its are keys to innovation study author martin ruef says weak allow for more experimentation in combining ideas from sources his research shows that entrepreneurs who spend more with a diverse network of strong and weak tiesare three times likely to innovate than entrepreneurs stuck within a uniform you may recall i posted before about how creative people brains that are more open to outside stimuli and are able to it otherwise they would be creative but driven insane by the so not surprised to see this also reminded of a conversation i had with hargadon author of how breakthroughs hargadon calls phenomenon of networks connected people or organizations that link groups and industries to integrate previously unrelated viewpoints technologies to resolve new it makes sense that innovative entrepreneurial people would be who see the value of weak social ties as a means of evaluating and sorting information about the world this these social connections generate the stuff out of which recombination is there a social networking site out there yet that really taps this done ryze been invited to friendster been invited orkutbut i studied any of them all that closely it would interesting to see if there are specific features on any of these that make it possible for this kind of networking pushing the social tie into a more explicit strong tie not useful for entrepreneurship and comments category andrew hargadon chemistry creativity collaborative creativity innovation general inventive innovation is a email this posted by joyce i agree with point that innovation is a mindset and a as a matter of fact i think one of the reasons this field is interesting and challenging it requires a holding of tensionbetween two opposites in several ways we have to committed to measuring results while also understanding innovation by definition means doing something new that could and if new enough has an outcome that probably cannot accurately predicted it means being able to hold the integrity of entire system while exploring the pieces and parts it requires touch as much as high tech and the engagement of the imagination possibility thinking as much as it does the practical evaluation of even thinking about innovation is an exercise in opposites is new it requires new ways of thinking new ways of operating measuring and monitoring progress innovation is old humans arguably other species also have been doing it for millions of the interesting thing about innovation is it is seldom almost always so it is new while at the same time it is old it is imaginative intuitive while also practical and analytical it is science and mindset and dontcha just love it actually part of the dichotomy also some of us love it and it makes some of us crazy perhaps hologram of the world at large and that rich complexity draws us repels all in the same comments category innovation innovation as a religion and as a email this posted by renee hopkins chuck frey of the innovation tools blog has joined in the discussion whether innovation is a process or a religion or both he a good question into the conversation emphasis the former approach innovation as religion is typified by computer which seems to worship product innovation above else at the expense of margins while the approach innovation as process is typified by dell computer has elevated business process innovation to almost an art form very hard however to find companies that embrace both kinds thinking about innovation m perhaps anybody have any while thinking i want to point out that the religion innovation does not only mean product innovation nor does process of innovation only mean business process innovation distinction i had in mind and what i think john meant when originally said this was more along the lines of what joyce innovation as a mindset that would be the religion vs innovation a predictable measurable process a company could approach processes with an mindset and could take approach to new that said to answer question i think southwest airlines is good example of a company that approaches innovation as both a and a process the company culture has been steeped in innovation its inception as a map on a cocktail napkin southwest has also a process approach to its innovations in business processes and products in this case think of new routes and new cities served new comments category innovation tidbits from the email this posted by renee hopkins courtesy of interesting nyt story about how consumers shape new offerings in personal

links go comments category commercialization customer viewpoint innovation general marketing new products to nonconsumers is chapter email this posted by renee hopkins in previous chapters the solution authors and raynor explored a disruptive strategy of competing nonconsumption but in so doing companies are faced with immediate challenge of how to find and sell to the nonconsumers who become your customers a case study with which many of us are how sony scored numerous times with disruptions such as transistor radio and the walkman illustrates the point the sony case also illustrates another point made in this which is that disruptive products often require disruptive channels sales and distribution this point is even more pertinent when you the broader definition of channels that the authors are using channel includes no just wholesale distributors and stores but any entity that adds value to or creates value around product as it wends its way toward the hands of the user example computer makers such as ibm and compaq are the through which microprocessors and operating reach the so if a disruptive strategy of competing against nonconsumption so much sense the authors point out why do incumbent companies do opposite which is trying to stretch the disruptive innovation compete against and ultimately supplant established products by competitors in large obvious market the answer has to do with resource mistake no is to frame the disruption as an opportunity and theory much of which they credit to hbs clark gilbert is that the disruption should be framed not as potential opportunity for further growth but as a threat to business that cannot be overlooked framing the disruption as a allows for resource commitments then the technology should be developed by an autonomous organization division a company that can frame it as an mistake no is to promise big numbers in the future in exchange resources in the present the very effort of trying to articulate convincing case for resources actually forces the entrepreneurs to the innovation as a sustaining technology in the existing because the biggest markets whose size can be substantiated are that already exist then when the results fall short of the numbers because the market of nonconsumers is not being targeted resources are the authors suggest that companies that try establish a parallel process in which to evaluate disruptive opportunities a process in which the go decisions made based not on numerical rules but on how well they fit the for disruption already explicated by the authors and even then best that can be predicted is that the initial conditions conducive to successful disruption is after all still a comments category books clayton christensen commercialization customer viewpoint general marketing marketing research new email this posted by renee hopkins getting off the innovation solution track for a i am woefully latefully remiss in making this recommendation nonetheless as far as i am concerned the blog that most explores the cutting edge of future disruption is brain waves our fellow corante blogger zack lynch i got the chance to meet zack my california trip a couple of weeks ago and he totally blew me with his vision of how neuroscience advances will disrupt everything in the future read him if you want to stay on top of this might mean for your business and for our something fun that zack posted in the same post where said nice things about ideaflow mit technology review has posted innovation futures prediction game a real game with prizes and a january deadline so go play have fun and comments category innovation all relative is chapter email this posted by renee hopkins a lengthy power outage at my hotel today kept me away from but been resolved now and so on to chapter which i read on plane another one of those counterintuitive statements that once think about it seems perfectly obvious few technologies business ideas are intrinsically sustaining or disruptive in rather their disruptive impact must be molded into strategy managers shape the idea into a plan and then implement it those would argue for a process view of innovation already understand innovation is relative to the context in which it and even the type of innovation is contextually relative an that is disruptive for one business may be sustaining to this chapter also introduces a third contextual dimension to disruptive innovation model introduced in dilemma in this lie the contexts of consumption and competition that give rise to different kinds of disruptions disruptions in which new technology service or product is aimed at introducing new into the market and disruptions that attack and most overserved i still love the endnotes in this book check this out from page a long note pointing out how wrong people were who complained dilemma was flawed because sometimes an industry leader manages avoid being killed by a disruptive competitor the when we see an airplane fly it does not disprove the law of links to solution comments category books clayton christensen innovation general new products solution not much of a solution after email this posted by renee hopkins my blog post on chapter of the is drew this from mark what is the message blog to read his entire post thoughtful and the first one seen negative about this book added a link to his post the is book resources here is my response to actually i totally agree that business people who attempt to his principles as gospel do so at their peril believe this is true of any set of principles there is business gospel why i spend so much time reading you also say that predictability does not necessarily come theory if the process itself is and chaotic assume that you are right and that the processes which disruptive innovation happens are by and and chaotic so do we then throw up our hands say the process in what christensen calls the black of innovation just cannot be controlled so let chaos rule do we do this is addressed by christensen in this endnote to chapter ultimately innovators must judge what they will work on how they will do it and what they should consider when those decisions is what is in the black box the acceptance randomness in innovation then is not a on the way greater understanding it is a barrier reading that to not that there is no randomness in innovation but that to a study on innovation on that randomness you also say the outcome of a process is often an property law and its many corollories have almost business axioms in a complex environment in which determinism has been obsolesced by our increasing understanding the nature of complexity to my mind a lot of between predictability and determinism and in this that christensen and theorizing finally you say it is awareness and not theory or that are the key to business success awareness of what surely awareness of that which can be known codified and about the innovation process is a helpful thing this can studied and in fact is what christensen seems to me to be trying do say we need that in addition to not instead of awareness that there are some things about the innovation that cannot be predicted we need both for business comments category books clayton christensen innovation general and innovation reading the email this

got the new clayton christensenanybody seen it be posting on it soon so if read it or know the feel free to weigh joyce renee in the process of digesting and figuring out to share info about solution which i think is reading however it will probably also be fairly overwhelming most folks because it has so much counterintuitive material so much that could only be implemented or changed at senior leslie joyce i agree with you that so much can only be at very senior levels it was interesting to me to see that a ago a lot of the engineers at dell were reading dilemma and yet at dell the innovation is in the supply chain the manufacturing not in the software and hardware that goes the door these were software those folks certainly face a dilemma they could not do anything about what they john yeah so take a deep breath and start i can tell you that the chapter deserves careful attention and savoring last night i down at a local starbucks with a cup of tazo zen tea and solution place was quiet except for lucinda cd world without tears playing on the sound system i began read underline make check marks scrawl notes in the how do i love this book let me count the ways the carefully statement of the thesis the placement of the starting point for argument and oh boy the it begins of course with the dilemma once company matures growth through innovation is a very risky at which few companies succeed because the very fact that strategies used to run a successful mature company are wildly at with the strategies needed to sustain disruptive pretty quickly christensen dispenses with the top two reasons for failure bad management management and zeroes in this one the widely held belief that growth is so hard to repeatedly and well because creating businesses is unpredictable the process he says looks unpredictable because results are unpredictable but you cannot say just by looking at results of the process whether the process that created those is capable of generating predictable output you must understand process itself and predictability he explains comes in effect starting out paces behind where most business start laying out all the basis on which going to build theory not just laying out a theory and these couple of pages expound on what makes a theory good and solid are written so that like the rest of the chapter they seem almost buoyant nearly as weighty as it sounds when i describe this elegance i attribute partly to the skillful use of actually they are chapter these are big solid footnotes filled with arguments that if put in the chapter would just bog it down yet they are there at the end of the chapter you want the endnotes are well worth the time it takes to read them they go in fascinating directions reasoned criticism of management a collection of references to articles and books on short discourse on the need for as opposed i half expected that note to include a reference to being and time when something is unusable for some purpose then assignment becomes or to semiotics after all an phenomena the existing theory cannot explain could be considered break in the code the and to a semiotician it is places where the code breaks in which the meaning of the code itself laid so maybe this is going to turn out to be a semiotics of innovation suspect not but it was fun to sit back after reading chapter one spend a

classic symptoms that almost innovations display primarily resistance and fear of realtors do not want to see their business move to an electronic but it is only a matter of time before much of the real estate is done through the the most analogous industry is airline ticket sales travel want to see their business move to the internet either but users want to do their own searching identifying

setting up idea factories that people who are great at inventing could just invent and that others could make and sell though this unrealistic and the patent systems of our government would crack under the weight of a number of idea factories it does seem logical technology innovations were of course at the fore and most in pharamceuticals healthcare and fuel technologies many innovations had come from two sources ideas or products from other sources like already medications or building on research inventions opening markets with existing products used in a new i saw less ideas and more i summarized a few trends for the httpaddr newsletter subscribers and repeat them idea factories leave invention to those who are best at nathan perspective may not be for everyone but he strongly for

corporate climate innovation general new products convergence notes vii consumer pain and new email this posted by renee hopkins in previous notes commented that a recurring theme convergence was how customer needs play a very important role in innovation and new product development efforts a presentation on this theme was innovation consumer pain into innovative new products by tom kuczmarski scott lutz contact info at link current for scott but a good description of tom quoted a best practices study his company did of respondents said conducting customer research prior to ideation is the most important driver of success in their a main reason why research for new product development should focus consumer needs and an understanding of lives rather product and service attributes is that the resulting ideas are likely to be true this makes absolute sense to me if you focus on needs come with new products that meet those needs these products may or may resemble current offerings but at the very least they be far out in left field a common problem with unfocused new development efforts that they still meet those needs since was the on the other hand when you focus on researching what consumers do like about an existing product the best you can expect incremental improvement for those in the world the exploratory research needs to around understanding companies and the roles your customers play their companies tom one more point tom made about starting with pain your new are more likely to be profitable if they enable the solution to problem on which consumers place a higher need portion of the presentation focused on the evergreen ongoing consumer needs that many successful new products family health pleasure energy balance and to uncover more focused needs than these and to drill down into evergreen themes and uncover specific needs you need qualitative quantitative research in my opinion these qualitative tools interviews interviews and ethnographic research are best ways to uncover the fears wishes anxieties frustrations and needs by which consumers express their quantitative research be nearly as revealing because having noted all of that you may recall that i had a here last month with andy hargadon author of breakthroughs happen the surprising truth about how innovate that takes this idea one step further our conversation about how consumers can be an open source for new product ideas said then using consumers for ideation especially those screened past product category usage makes sense from the point of view the consumers have both domain relevant knowledge as potential of the new product and have creativity relating this back to tom and presentation say start with some qualitative research around discovering actual pain cognitive use that as a starting for ideation as tom pointed out in the presentation but then say you are doing that ideation with consumers who have experience in that product category their own pain is the

topic crucial to innovation and one discussed here jim mikula and ruth ann hattori led this session and most my comments here are based on their white paper trust and innovative change which was part of the session if you are concerned about the need for setting up a relationship trust for a collaborative innovation venture well worth basically mikula and hattori spell out these four attributes of history of ability to commitment to the individuals or companies are said to be highly invested if all attributes of trust are present in their relationship and highly invested state is one necessary precondition for innovation of course whether or not these trust attributes present in the relationship or could be developed is a matter opinion mikula and hattori are simply offering the suggestion this opinion should be based on a careful assessment rather than instinct and their framework offers a structure with which to this another good point regarding trust assessments they their example you may trust your controller with finances but you may not trust him or her to create outstanding training comments category collaborative creativity conferences innovation general open convergence notes ii workplace innovation space foam email this posted by renee hopkins more conference notes and ruminations this time on the innovating space using innovation space by jason heredia turnstone a division of steelcase and tom mulhern of research a ethnographic research research some done in conjunction with conifer asks questions what kind of spaces enhance innovation and what kind space detracts from innovation and even better where does live in the workplace answer in the linkages between and yes this is the very territory that the social folks are working on one way to look at social software would be the software allow for the right kind of linkages between people right kind of access to the space where innovation lives in talk tom and jason set forth some principles of innovation space i include them here because i wonder if these same principles apply to the space that a group by using software or if the entire model would be different here are persistence supports the continuous refinement of the shared intent not just meeting space but shared work space in sustained purposeful efforts take place and leave traces interaction encourages and explicitly drives interaction the digital and physical dynamism purpose of the space changes as intentions and flexibility supports change modes in it seems to me that these would be excellent principles to apply social software but not my field so totally open comments there and of course if you talk about social software terms of disruptive innovations then at some point perhaps bubbling up now be some kind of software that allows us interact and work together in ways that we even imagine yet really disruptive it will allow us to work together in ways even its one other interesting thing i found out during tom and presentation the material best for group projects is that stuff always thought was called foam core but is so tom says fome cor better than easel pads or things up on walls because it allows you both to work in large and to save your work while still in the large so can a group accomplish with a wiki and a groupblog such this one what they could accomplish with some fome core colored finally either tom or jason i forget who mentioned that steelcase site has a lot of information on space design and issues they kidding there i found an excellent workplace report titled hothouse environments breakthrough innovation which presents the findings of two years surveying more than corporate executives facilities and design professionals from various industries on these how can the workplace affect the way people work and how they are what keeps them from sharing information and collaborative steelcase also has an called where i this article based on the hothouse

worth comments category innovation convergence notes i idea management customers are but ip is email this posted by renee hopkins just get this straight upfront i am not a demon for that reason just now around to blogging my notes from last convergence but what i lack in speed i hope to make up for in got lots of notes and impressions to first my overall main impression was that capital arrived last convergence had just attendees this year were and new conferences on the subject are springing up mushrooms after a thunderstorm including this on innovation at which ideaflow contributors joyce wycoff and wolpert will both be very first keynote speaker mark turrell imaginatik referenced a famous in innovation circles gary hamel quote that seems to be on its way to becoming innovation must become what quality was years turrell sounded another common theme in his keynote measuring financial impact of innovation calculating your innovation gap common theme was to make a differentiation between innovation creativity and pretty much every speaker i heard did this boiled to the basics the difference seemed to be that innovation is a and creativity is not devotees of a process approach to might beg to differ but for the purposes of this conference distinction allowed most speakers a productive platform from which dive into their take on the innovation my notes on definitions much more corporate thing than creativity much more of a people who get creativity are the ones who control the the ones you must convince to fund innovation is the process of handling new things creativity is invention is a invention and creativity are part the innovation the main point of his talk was to expound on ioi or the impact of innovation he defined this as the proportion of current future revenue and profit that is dependent on the ability innovate and defined ioi components as revenue growth protection productivity and disruptive change unplanned or he then said the innovation gap is the difference between the level of innovation ioi and the current innovation capacity which based on the ability of a firm to handle new idea management is important because too many new ideas block pipeline you could expect him to say that since imaginatik is in business but this was another theme that was by many speakers including the other keynote george land of the farsight first definitions at the beginning his talk a systems process for innovation he defined innovation organized advanced innovation method is a process for bringing to a corporation most important is the first part determining strategic innovation would be for the company seventy percent of and budget should go to the first three steps he says which even get you to the generating concepts stage the important three steps encompass alignment an innovation audit and determination of an innovation strategy a big part of this determining internal and external deep needs what the customer really want or need in the future land says his actually puts a large number of resources into training a customers in creativity to get them to articulate needs i of course found this fascinating in light of our approach which has been discussed here and connecting to another discussion been having here this time on the copyright wars land dropped something of bombshell early on in his speech by declaring that product are very easy to copy and patents are an invitation to a sure enough the first question in the following was about assertion land explained further patents are very easy to go the issue is a flow of innovation and in the pipeline develop after what got now has been copied always assume going to get copied and try to discover where you can innovate that will be invisible developing intellectual assets documented and past knowledge that can lead to the creation of new through systematic innovation is better than developing ip which defined as knowledge with legal according to land only of corporate innovation comes from departments so not the most important place to be innovative a corporation the companies most successful at innovation stealthily innovating their process distribution or some other hard for competitors to grasp and but in any case he echoed turrell by saying bust the dam ideas until got somewhere for the water to go efforts must be targeted or they create chaos a duty and obligation not to collect too many ideas to be ruthless with finally and this is another theme that was echoed over and over the ceo must drive innovation and financial gap analysis is on the front end you must arm yourself with the facts land also that a company should have an evp or innovation heading an innovation department that would integrate all functions marketing technology business development etc and a biggest barriers to innovation in his view are lack of leadership drive innovation and lack of strategic alignment regarding and this was just the first part of the first day more to comments category collaborative creativity commercialization conferences corporate climate creativity disruptive innovation innovation law policy marketing

business done if i had told to do small appliance it would have been low on their priority list this main role in life is to create new comments category innovation wars vs email this posted by joyce joyce is on a book deadline so posting her answer to what just posted about creativity innovation and the i think this post is very much about the vs mindset easy to say we have to do this or that harder to figure out how we can do this and that the issue is a perfect example free flow of information stimulate creativity and people do need to benefit from labors even creative last year at convergence we had john perry barlow speak he very much on the side of opening up creative works in order stimulate more creativity he also said that in the time people could freely download music the record industry was more and making more money since they clamped down on sales have gone down he said a similar pattern was true with grateful dead who allowed people to freely record obviously they suffer much financially and what created was an army of supporters who recruited other fans sharing bootleg tapes which turned into record sales and as a writer i feel the buffeting winds of both sides of this but know there is a place in the middle where if you freely enough you get compensated for your efforts also i found out long time ago i can spend a lot of time energy and money to protect my intellectual property or i can just producing more since i like the producing more way of living worry much about the i guess it comes down to a mindset do we believe in a world abundance where sharing freely results in abundance for all or world of poverty where if you have more it means i have less know the reality of the world but i do know i prefer have a mindset of abundance even when it sometimes to be working comments category innovation email this posted by renee hopkins need to remind you all about the th annual which will be september in minneapolis our own wycoff is the

right will lead you to information about the conference as well the links in this comments category innovation and email this posted by leslie greetings delighted to join my esteemed friends and in this discussion of creativity and been exploring the relationship between innovation and john wolpert and others have talked about the notion of trusted intermediaries innomediaries for the exchange innovations among one area of intersection between innovation and and there are many others for example political systems innovation political systems need to provide innovators with environment in which they can trust that they will be able derive some financial benefit from their work in a recent street journal piece if economists are so smart why africa so poor douglass north one of my favorite historians and others discuss the relationship between economies and political systems the efficient functioning markets requires that some organization enforce contracts property rights it is unappealing to go to the trouble building a market and commercializing an innovation in environment in which work can be snatched away by a or for that matter by a what are the infrastructure ingredients that foster innovation political infrastructure the economic infrastructure the infrastructure the market infrastructure all of these among others interact to produce better or worse environments innovation and its attendant prosperity and we need to the optimal combination simply one that is explore these thoughts in future comments category innovation and small worlds bridging vs email this posted by renee hopkins one last set of comments on andrew how happen as i said before focused primarily on his idea innovation happens when technology brokers bridge disconnected worlds hargadon wants firms to allow brokers to move within the small worlds that already exist most firms there are many places within teams between divisions between politics geography and lack of communication have created worlds by creating gaps in the flow of ideas and people across so when innovation fails or happening does that mean gaps are being i think so and to understand better i think important to look at the characteristics of gaps themselves thinking about these gaps reminded me of essay the unspoken of groups based on his talk last emerging technology conference which recently read in the essay weinberger says in general explicit does violence to what is being made explicit things explicit like unearthing an archaeological find just been sitting there waiting to be dug up making often usually means disambiguating and reducing so when managers try to foster innovation by merging worlds by trying to make existing weak ties into strong think initiatives the often fails why because bridging gaps allows people to existing ideas in different ways practicing recombination but when you merge small groups together the act of merging can do violence to the differences that created very gaps trying to take advantage of in the process ideas that could come from bridging the gaps actually rather than remain available for inventive in order to create innovativion we need to merge or the gaps between groups of people and their ideas we need bridge them in a way that preserves the ambiguity that created gaps in the first comments category innovation email this posted by renee hopkins internship ibm program allows projects to says this article looks like ideaflow blogger been later another recent article on extreme comments category innovation connecting with email this posted by john note john wolpert is joining the new improved of ideaflow this is his first hi there my name is john wolpert i have been working in the of corporate innovation for fourteen years i am currently an at what we call the incubator for talent technology and innovation in austin tx site extreme blue is a lab runs up to biztech experiments a year that assumptions behind emerging business opportunities such as grid autonomic computing linux pervasive computing and services these projects accelerate investment around innovative new growth initiatives we maintain such labs in the us and six more in europe the middle east the program also doubles as our talent each project is made up of a team of new hires and interns typically one business and three technical specialists by experienced ibmers combining the missions of talent and corporate innovation both technical invention and the same operation has allowed our program to consistently through a number of otherwise lean when we talk about innovation in our lab we speak mainly the following definition pursuing new opportunities exploiting new or potentially technologies in ways that change the economics of a system introducing change into the core concept of a going concern this my interest is mainly in the area of there are some great minds focused on how companies innovation practices inside the firm to me though the best these practices ultimately die off or are gamed into irrelevance the forces roiling inside a closed system like a firm ignored shifting and capricious priorities orphan that simply fit with the business model of that on the other hand i have observed that innovators who connect to innovators in other firms a trick of savvy rife with legal risks to be sure tend to grow in and both their innovation regimes and the ideas that come out such regimes are more likely to enjoy sustained attention and more important wider sources of insight and i say innovations prove more successful in long run there is not enough good research to draw any conclusion on this yet but the game does change when you multiple firms early and often in innovation regime blue for example has a roster of what we call mentors company executives from various industries who give advice on our wilder ideas it turns out that their validation more than once meant the difference between a project that nowhere and a project that got funded as a proper of course openness with other firms presents a problem companies are not set up to expose early insights and capabilities to another legal entity without the use of a lot lawyers and agreements i part of the answer to this problem involves the use of intermediaries in some cases but this leave for entry

million progressive automotive x prize today announced the launch of its sixth incentive competition the million wendy schmidt oil cleanup challenge httpaddr at a press conference in washington dc the announcement was made by prize chairman peter h diamandis together with wendy schmidt personally funded the million prize purse wendy schmidt president of the schmidt family foundation founder of the th hour project and climate central as well as with husband eric of the schmidt marine science research other speakers included philippe cousteau son of jan and cousteau sr and grandson of captain jacques yves cousteau and ceo of earthecho international and dr dave phd director of special projects at the woods hole the goal of the wendy schmidt oil cleanup x challenge is to entrepreneurs engineers and scientists worldwide to innovative rapidly deployable and highly efficient methods capturing crude oil from the ocean surface in making the the x prize foundation hopes to attract philanthropic and capital to support development of this important capability and a global platform where new technologies can be competed and the best approaches demonstrated to prepare for the devastating impact of the deepwater horizon oil spill will for years and it is inevitable that future spills will occur from wells and from transport tankers stated dr diamandis to prepared to safeguard oceans and shores the x prize foundation announcing the wendy schmidt oil cleanup x challenge to find the effective and solutions for capturing oil from spills at the spill site thus limiting their impacts and our oceans shores marshes and importantly the health of the people and wildlife which live and thrive in with more then ten thousands of ocean oil platforms across the and million of barrels of oil being transported every day by not a question of there will be another oil spill stated wendy schmidt we need to come up with solutions to capture oil on the surface to minimize the harm spills are causing to marine life coastal wetlands and beaches to our livelihoods a harm that can last for generations this is i am personally funding this x challenge to inspire innovators the world and all those who want to help address what has happened the gulf to focus on solutions to an ongoing systemic competition the wendy schmidt oil cleanup x challenge has two phase i from august april teams from around the world invited to register for this competition and to submit their to clean up oil slicks created by spills or leaks from ships or eg exxon valdez land drainage waste disposal or oil spill eg deepwater an expert panel of judges from and academia will evaluate all of the proposals along the technical approach and commercialization no negative environmental scalability of and ability to deploy technology cost and human of improvement of technology over baseline booms and phase ii the judges will select up to of the top teams demonstrate their ability to efficiently and rapidly clean up oil the ocean surface in a competition these proofs capability which will determine the winner will take place the national oil spill response research renewable energy facility ohsmett in new jersey the top team that demonstrates ability to recover oil on the surface at the highest recovery rate orr and recovery efficiency re will win the million grand purse second place will win and third will win in competition wendy schmidt is president of the schmidt family foundation strives to advance the development of clean energy and support

cleanup x challenge is a phase team registration and concept evaluation timeline october through april teams submit their technology concepts via the x prize website to independent judging submissions will be judged feasibility of technological approach and commercialization approximate cost of the ability to have no negative environmental scalability of and ability to deploy scalability of approach demonstration of the highest oil recovery rate orr and recovery efficiency based on the expert evaluations a set of finalist teams be selected and invited to compete in a competition at national oil spill response research renewable energy test phase team demonstration and judging timeline april through october all team finalists will be notified and provided the opportunity test their approaches during a practice phase at the ohmsett following the practice phase team finalists will move to demonstration phase at ohmsett teams will be measured their ability recover oil on the seawater surface at the highest recovery rate orr and the highest recovery efficiency the performer will receive a million grand prize the second performer will receive and the third place performer receive cesar harada jan for us the most problematic time was when do we have to put machine in the the deadline changed and we can now test our machine until october and an excellent news that means that it does not with our first deadline for the the world port day in rotterdam september so if we really want to attempt to compete to we now we need to find and evaluate our chances to win but problem is that the criteria is oil recovery rate so machines are probably faster and can take more volume of oil strong point are capacity to operated unmanned far from shore rough weather not the conditions in an artificial basin so protei competitive if we get there do we have a chance to win if wining what do we get by participating this competition etienne gernez feb quoting the x prize submissions will be judged feasibility of technological approach and commercialization plan do we have a business plan ready approximate cost of the approach same ability to have no negative environmental impact scalability of and ability to deploy technology need to have swarm algorithm in scalability of approach demonstration of the highest oil recovery rate orr and recovery efficiency the recovery rate per protei depends is the recovery capability of the sorbent boom pulled by vehicle very efficient booms can absorb up to times their what is the exact definition of oil recovery rate orr and efficiency judging from all these points say that we are competitive but chances to win are small as long as all these points are not business plan swarm algorithm definition of recovery rate question is this competition going to happen again and when that such a great cesar harada feb business we do not really have a business plan ready maybe because we got being supported by early on now we are being approached potential sponsors we really need a business efficiency my concern is that test happen in large swimming pools which ridiculous since oil spill rarely happen in swimming pools but often in the ocean so it is unfair fro protei since protei needs move around perdendicularly to the wind to oppose maximum register today and discuss if this competition is opportunity or a

email ankurt at home kdd cup student performance cup student performance kdd cup this how generally or narrowly do students learn how quickly or will the rate of improvement vary between students what does it for one problem to be similar to another it might depend on the knowledge required for one problem is the same as the required for another but is it possible to infer the requirements of problems directly from student performance without human analysis of the this challenge asks you to predict student performance mathematical problems from logs of student interaction with tutoring systems this task presents interesting technical has practical importance and is scientifically kdd cup task at the start of the competition we will provide data sets development data sets and challenge data sets each of the data will be divided into a training portion and a test portion specified on the data page student performance labels will withheld for the test portion of each data set the competition will be to develop a learning model based on the challenge development data sets use this algorithm to learn from the portion of the challenge data sets and then accurately predict performance in the test sections at the end of the competition actual winner will be determined based on their performance an unseen portion of the challenge test sets we will only each last submission of the challenge you will be allowed to train on the training portion of each data and will then be evaluated on your performance at providing first attempt values for the test portion we will provide feedback formatting errors in prediction files but we will not reveal on test data until the end of the competition note that for each file you submit an unidentified portion will be used to validate data and provide scores for the leaderboard while the portion will be used for determining the winner of the for a valid submission the evaluation program will compare predictions you provided against the undisclosed true values and the difference as root mean squared error if a data set file missing from a submission the evaluation program will report the as for that file the total score for a submission will then be average of the rmse values all data sets will receive equal weight the final average independent of their at the end of the competition the winner will be the team with lowest total technical in terms of technical challenges we mention just a the data matrix is sparse not all students are given problem and some problems have only or students who each item so the contestants need to exploit relationships problems to bring to bear enough data to hope to there is a strong temporal dimension to the data students over the course of the school year students must master skills before moving on to others and incorrect responses to items lead to incorrect assumptions in other items so must pay attention to temporal relationships as well as relationships among which problems a given student sees is determined in part student choices or past success history eg students only remedial problems if they are having trouble with the problems so contestants need to pay attention to relationships in order to avoid selection scientific and practical from a practical perspective improved models could be saving of hours of time and effort in learning algebra models should both increase achievement levels and reduce time focusing on just the latter for the million students that about hours per year with cognitive tutors for say these optimizations can reduce time to mastery by at one experiment showed the time reduction was about cen et hours per student or million student hours year saved and this million is less than of all students in the us if we include all algebra students x and grades for which there are carnegie learning assistment applications x that brings our rough estimate to million student hours per year saved in that time students can moving on in math and science or doing other things they from a scientific viewpoint the ability to achieve low error on unseen data is evidence that the learner has discovered the underlying factors which make items easier or harder students knowing these factors is essential for the design curricula and lesson plans both for human instructors for automated tutoring so you the contestants have potential to influence lesson design improving retention student engagement reducing wasted time and increasing transfer future currently k education is extremely focused on assessment the child left behind act has put incredible pressure on schools to to the test meaning that a significant amount of time is preparing and taking standardized tests much of the time drilling for and taking these tests is wasted from the point of view deep learning retention transfer and desire for learning so any advances which allow us to reduce the role standardized tests hold the promise of increasing deep to this end a model which accurately predicts performance as a byproduct of tutoring could augment replace some of the current standardized tests this idea is assistment from the goal of assessing performance simultaneously assisting learning previous work has suggested assistment is indeed possible eg an appropriate analysis tutoring logs can predict standardized performance as well as standardized test results can standardized test performance feng heffernan but it is far from clear what the best prediction methods so the algorithms may provide insights that important improvements in fundamental if a student is correct at one problem eg starting with a if i multiply it by and then add i get number at one time how likely are they to be correct at problem eg solve for x at a later these questions are of both scientific interest and importance scientifically relevant deep questions include what is nature of human knowledge representations and how generally do transfer their learning from one situation to another human do not always represent and solve mathematical tasks as we expect you might be surprised if you thought that a student working the second problem above the equation is likely to correct given that he was correct on the first problem the problem it turns out that most students are able to solve simple problems like this one more successfully than the matched koedinger nathan koedinger alibali nathan other words there are interesting surprises to be found in performance cognitive tutors for mathematics are now in use in more than schools across the us for some students per year while systems have been quite successful surprises like the one suggest that the models behind these systems can be much improved generally a number of studies have demonstrated how detailed task analysis can result in dramatically better instruction feldon van merrienboer yates early lee such analysis is painstaking and requires a high level of expertise we believe it possible that machine learning on large sets can reap many of the benefits of cognitive task analysis without the great effort and expertise currently cen h koedinger

competition conditions of participation anybody who complies with the rules of challenge kdd cup is welcome to participate only the are excluded from participating the kdd cup is part of competition program of the knowledge discovery in databases kdd july in washington dc participants are required to attend the kdd cup workshop which will be held the conference and the workshop is open to anyone who registers proceedings of the competition will be published in a volume of jmlr workshop and conference proceedings anonymity all entrants must identify themselves by registering on kdd cup website however they may elect to remain anonymous choosing a nickname and checking the box make my profile if this box is checked only the nickname will appear in leaderboard instead of the real name participant emails will appear anywhere on the website and will be used only by the to communicate with the participants to be eligible for prizes participants will have to publicly reveal their identity and the box make my profile teams to register a team only register the team leader and choose nickname for your team let you know later how to disclose members of your team we limit each team to one final entry as individual you cannot enter under multiple names this would considered cheating and would disqualify you nor can you under multiple teams multiple teams from the same however are allowed so long as each team leader is a different and the teams do not intersect during the development period team must have a different registered team leader to be ranked in challenge and qualify for prizes each registered individual or team leader will have to disclose the names of team members before the final results of the challenge get hence at the end of the challenge you will have to choose to team you want to belong only one before the results are released if a person participates in multiple teams those teams be disqualified after the results are released no change in composition will be allowed before the end of the challenge the leaders will have to declare the composition of their team this have to correspond to the list of in the proceedings they decide to publish their results hence a professor cannot name on all students papers but can be thanked a team can be either a student team eligible for or not a student team eligible for travel in a student a professor should be cited appropriately but in the spirit of competition student teams should consist primarily of student work will ask for participants to state whether they are a student prior to the end of the data data are available for download from the data page registered participants each data set is available as a archive to facilitate downloading for viewing accuracy on leaderboard participants may enter results on either or development and challenge data sets but results on the data sets will not count toward the final challenge duration the challenge is about months in duration june to be eligible for prizes final submissions must received by june pm edt feedback feedback is available through the results page and submission method the method of submission is via the form on upload page to be ranked submissions must include results on portion only of the challenge or development data sets results on development data sets will not count as part of the multiple submissions are evaluation and ranking for each team only the last valid entry by the team leader will count towards determining the winner entries must include results on both challenge data sets the method scoring is described on this reproducibility participation is not conditioned on delivering nor publishing methods however we will ask the top participants to voluntarily fill out a fact sheet about their contribute papers to the proceedings and help in reproducing prizes thanks to our sponsors facebook elsevier and ibm we will be offering the following prizes to student prize amounts

all see the file ending in challenge data data sets students steps algebra i bridge to algebra predictions on challenge data sets will count toward determining winner of the competition in each of these two data sets asked to provide predictions in the column correct first attempt a subset of the data our available data takes the form of records of interactions students and systems the students problems in the tutor and each interaction between the student computer is logged as a transaction four key terms form the blocks of our data these are problem step knowledge component opportunity to more concretely define these terms use following using a computer tutor for geometry a student completes a where she is asked to find the area of a piece of scrap metal left after removing a circular area the end of a can from a metal figure the student enters everything in the worksheet except the row labels and the column and labels for the first figure a problem from carnegie cognitive tutor a problem is a task for a student to perform that typically multiple steps in the example above the problem asks the student find the area of a piece of scrap metal left over after removing circular area the end of a can from a metal square figure row labeled in the worksheet corresponds to a in language domains such tasks are more often called activities exercises rather than problems a language activity for example involve finding and correcting all of the grammatical errors in a step is an observable part of the solution to a problem steps are observable they are partly determined by the user available to the student for solving the problem it is necessarily the case that the interface completely determines steps for example the student might be expected to create new rows columns of a table before filling in their in the example problem above the steps for the first question find the radius of the end of the can a find the length of the square find the area of the end of the find the area of the square find the area of the this whole collection of steps comprises the solution the last can be considered the answer and the others are students might not and often do not complete a problem by only the correct steps the student might request a hint from tutor or enter an incorrect value we refer to the actions of student that is working towards performing a step correctly transactions a transaction is an interaction between the student the tutoring system each hint request incorrect attempt or attempt is a transaction and each recorded transaction is referred as an attempt for a in table transactions have been consolidated and displayed student and step producing a step record table this is the format the data provided to you in this competition a step record is summary of all of a given attempts for a given table data from the making cans example aggregated row student problem s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s table data from the making cans example aggregated row incorrects hints error rate knowledge component opportunity knowledge a knowledge component is a piece of information that can be used accomplish tasks perhaps along with other knowledge knowledge component is a generalization of everyday terms like principle fact or skill and cognitive science terms like production rule misconception or each step in a problem requires the student to know something relevant concept or skill to perform that step correctly in data sets each step can be labeled with one or more knowledge components needed see the last column of table example kc labels in line of table the researcher hypothesized that the student needs to know to pogarea in line the knowledge component hypothesized to be needed to answer every knowledge component is associated with one or more steps one more knowledge components can be associated with a step association is typically originally defined by the problem author researchers can provide alternative knowledge components associations with steps together these are known as a component an opportunity is a chance for a student to demonstrate whether he she has learned a given knowledge component a count for a given knowledge component increases by each time student encounters a step that requires this knowledge component the opportunity count column of table for an opportunity is both a test of whether a student knows a component and a chance for the student to learn it while students make multiple attempts at a step or request hints from a tutor are transactions the whole set of attempts are considered a opportunity as a student works through steps in problems have multiple opportunities to apply or learn a knowledge for all competition data sets each record will be a step that the following row the row number update for challenge data the row number in each file train test and submission is longer taken from the original data set file instead rows renumbered within each file so instead of n rows for training file and rows for the file it now n for the training file and n for the anon student id unique anonymous identifier for a problem hierarchy the hierarchy of curriculum levels the problem name unique identifier for a problem view the total number of times the student encountered problem so step name each problem consists of one or more steps eg the area of rectangle abcd or divide both sides of the by the step name is unique within each problem but there be collisions between different problems so the only identifier for a step is the pair of and step start time the starting time of the step can be first transaction time the time of the first transaction the correct transaction time the time of the correct attempt the step if there was step end time the time of the last transaction toward the step duration sec the elapsed time of the step in calculated by adding all of the durations for transactions were attributed to the step can be null if step start

multiple kcs assigned it multiple kcs for a step are separated by two opportunity describes practice by knowledge component corresponding opportunities are similarly separated by model name a count that increases by one each the student encounters a step with the listed knowledge steps with multiple kcs will have multiple opportunity separated by additional kc models which exist for the challenge data sets appear as additional pairs of columns kc and opportunity for each for the test portion of the challenge data sets values will not provided for the following step start first transaction correct transaction step end step duration correct step duration error step duration correct first the competition will use data sets development data sets and challenge data sets from different tutoring systems these data come from multiple schools over multiple school years the include the the carnegie learning algebra system deployed and and the bridge to algebra system deployed the development data sets have previously been used in research and available through the pittsburgh science of learning center as well as this the challenge data sets will come from same tutoring systems for subsequent school years the challenge sets have not been made available to researchers prior to the kdd each data set will be broken into two files a training file and a file a third file a submission file will be provided for results the submission file will contain a subset of the columns the test each data set will be split as in the diagram above each horizontal line represents a record of a student working on a step the data set is broken down student unit a classification of a portion of the math hierarchy eg linear inequality graphing section a portion the curriculum that falls within a unit eg section of test rows are determined by a program that randomly selects one for each student within a unit and places all rows that student and problem in the test file based on time all rows for the unit will be placed in a training file all following rows for that unit will be discarded goal at testing time will be to predict whether the student got step right on the first attempt for each step in that problem prediction will take the form of a value between and for the correct first for each test file you submit an unidentified portion will be used validate your data and provide scores for the leaderboard while remaining portion will be used for determining the winner of how to format and ship to submit your results you must return the results in a separate file for each data set using the same filename as the submission file these text files must be grouped into one archive can upload either results for the development data sets or challenge data sets but not both at the same time you may results on a subset of data sets to get online each submission file will contain two row the row number as carried over from the original data file update for challenge data sets the row in each file train test and submission is no longer taken the original data set file instead rows are renumbered each file so instead of n rows for the training file rows for the file it is now n for training file and n for the correct first attempt your prediction value a decimal between and that indicates the probability of a correct attempt for this the upload page will reject submissions that are missing test provide test rows out of order contain duplicate test rows or row values that are not in the original test file it will also submissions that provide values in the correct first attempt that are not a decimal between and predictions must be for all rows if errors are detected in the file the upload page provide feedback as to where in the the

type scores that were used to determine the competition winners validating most of the predictions instead of a small that during the competition the evaluation process that powered leaderboard only looked at a small portion of participant files a much larger portion was used to determine the winners thought this suggestion was a great idea but we want to the leaderboard and individual submission pages in such a way that no longer reflected the scores and ranking given to participants at end of the competition as a solution added a toggle to leaderboard and individual submission pages allowing you to view the cup scoring where a majority of the prediction file is used score the entry or leaderboard scoring where a small portion of prediction file is used to score the entry we calculate both so can toggle between them cup scoring is more accurate but scoring is what was used during the competition to power registration and general the leaderboard just went blank and it says there are no is it safe to yes it is still safe to submit and the leaderboard has not been there is a bug in our system that is causing the leaderboard to empty under high load the submission and the leaderboard data still stored i get a verification email what should i contact us and tell us that you registered but received no email verify your account please do not create a new where can i find more info about the professors at wpi want to help undergrads compete professors heffernan ryan baker joe beck and carolina ruiz of polytechnic institute will be giving online webinar lectures at wpi posting them online for undergrads across the country they will suggestions on how to do well on the kdd cup this year going to give away some tools see their website for more httpaddr when can i register and download you can register april at pm edt and download data as soon can team members come from different team members can definitely come from different organizations the restriction on teams is that any person can only participate in single team see the rules for more information the difference between a student team and a a team can be either a student team eligible for or not a student team eligible for travel in a student a professor should be cited appropriately but in the spirit of competition student teams should consist primarily of student work will ask for participants to state whether they are a student prior to the end of the competition our sponsors have provided prizes for student does this mean there be any monetary prizes for participants other than travel rather than splitting the prizes among student and we decided that we will only award monetary prizes to students year since the cash prize would make the biggest difference for this way we can offer more consistent cash prizes while still a sizable travel award for all top placed participants for an participant we figure that being a top performer in the kdd cup worth way more in pr than the cash prize anyway plus our has been that in some cases providing cash prizes to participants creates more problems on their side than worth hope the lack of prizes for industry keep you from in the kdd cup this data what are the differences between development and challenge data development data sets are provided for familiarizing yourself with format and developing your learning model using them is optional your predictions on these data sets will not count toward the winner of the competition development data sets differ challenge sets in that the actual student performance values for prediction column correct first attempt are provided for all see the file ending in challenge data sets will be made available on april at pm predictions on these data sets will count toward determining the of the competition in each of these two data sets be asked provide predictions in the column correct first attempt for a of the steps for more information on which steps these will be the bottom of our data what are the different files in each data set zip file i this file contains all training rows for the data set but test rows use this file to train your learning this file contains only test rows for the data set you make predictions for all of these rows in the column first attempt but submit only the columns row and correct attempt see the submission file format a submission file composed of only columns row and first attempt this shows the format of a valid submission in which provide prediction values probabilities in second column note that only test rows are included training rows for development sets this file is only included for development data sets this file shows all the actual student performance values for test rows in prediction column correct first attempt it also values for the various time columns columns which are empty in the file these are documented on the data page up to how like to use the development data sets and the actual student performance your description of the data format states that there should be test problem composed of multiple step rows per student and unit i see more than one problem per in a development data i also see only a single test row per not the rows you describe this are some errors in the development data sets we might update development data sets to fix this issue but we will make sure happen in the challenge data sets expect only one problem in any challenge data set composed of one or more rows the purpose of releasing development data sets was to find issues in the data and to allow participants to familiarize with the data the file appears to end on a partial that has only fields and no line this is a bug in that development data set we plan to update development data set april update an updated version of the algebra data set with fixed final row is available on the data april do the steps for a given problem have to be completed in a no for a given problem the order of the steps completed could across students or it could be the same the set of steps could also vary or be the some problems some steps optional also note that for some steps the correct answer the enters could vary across students eg the tutor might have and or something more i see that there are some problems which have different number of when attempted by different students for example in unit problem eg has been attempted by multiple students but each the number of steps differs does the number of steps in a instantiation of a problem depend on the performance of the student the earlier steps of the same problem or even previously problems or is it by the tutor program for a instantiation and a student has to just attempt the steps sent by the number of steps you see for a problem could vary across based on performance within a problem eg the tutor might extra steps based on errors made or just based on the approach student took eg the student might skip optional i know of an example where performance on a prior problem affects number of steps in a later problem in the sense that the tutor control access to steps when looking at solver or grapher data unit referenced is an equation solver unit the number of steps always varies because these are somewhat exploratory environments steps steps that closer to the solution allowed so with respect to steps some tutored problems are than one of the fields is corrects which is described as total attempts by the student for the step only increases if the step encountered more than why would the same step come up than once in a this can happen in a few cases one case is where the tutoring allows the student to enter something and receive feedback but not lock the widget upon receiving the correct response an example a problem that includes an interactive graph where the student can the scale of the graph they can set the scale of the graph as times as like so long as they provide valid numbers each attempt is a correct one another case is in equation problems in these problems the student could transform the any number of times the step is represented as the current so if a transformation leads to an equation seen already number of corrects would increase by other cases probably exist the is each step uniquely identified by problem hierarchy problem and step name or is just problem name and step name a step row is uniquely identified by this student problem hierarchy problem name problem view update a bug in the data prevents this from always being the case may how should i interpret these long knowledge components i often see eliminate nested clt nested mult mult expr const expr division division both mult both mult both divide both divide the skill here is eliminate the items listed in the braces clt nested clt nested parens distribute mult right etc is just a static list of every operation that could trigger this skill the order of things is not at all meaningful is no hierarchical or sequential structure here it is simply how was listed by the tutor developer in fact any element in this may not be relevant to the particular problem the student was on this is simply a list of all possible operations that possibly be involved in triggering the skill in this case there are lot of operations which could trigger the eliminate parens can you tell me more about the kc models in the challenge data the extra columns mean that for the challenge data sets there additional kc models a kc model is a list of mappings between step and one or more knowledge components it is also known as transfer model or a skill model each kc model is represented by columns kc and within a model there can be multiple associated with a step when there are they are separated by corresponding opportunity numbers are also separated by and given in the same order so each kc has an opportunity count for a simple answer about these individual models is that rules is a categorization of similar steps and ktracedskills is more categorization rules corresponds with production rules in the tutor which get grouped that correspond with the ktracedskills believe there is a strict mapping between each of ktracedskills and instances of the rules but there may the ktracedskills level is used by the tutor to future problems and is presumed to be the level at which students learning and transferring their knowledge from one task step to another related one that presumption is not always born by the data and the rules kc model may provide clues to better clustering of steps to predict transfer of to summarize in a slightly different ktracedskills these are the skills that are the ones that appear on the subskills these are the skills identified by the system whether not they are being rules these are the actual rule names used to determine skills distinction between these and subskills is that this kc model include the actual model rules not the while subskills would be based on what does it mean for the current end time to be later than start time of the following in general steps can be interleaved a student can start working one step complete another step and return to the first step in and of this explanation great fit because row had no incorrect attempts meaning somehow the student started the finalanswer step and then seconds later completed it but perhaps finalanswer is representing class of final answers since there are corrects for that that would mean that a step called finalanswer was available for student to solve correctly times which they did without also our faq entry where we mention equation solving can you give us some suggestions about how to understand some names eg xr and is row column and indicates where this student appeared within the table that students are working within sure about xr but it may be better inferred from the other step in the same is there any manual of the tutor system it will be very helpful for to understand the system and data sets as we have never used tutoring system to learn more about the tutor see some of the papers about the tutor and some about relevant units in the bridge to algebra these include the ritter steven haverty lisa koedinger kenneth hadley corbett albert integrating intelligent software tutors the math classroom g blume and k heid eds research on and the teaching and learning of mathematics vol cases perspectives charlotte nc iap koedinger k r aleven v exploring the assistance in experiments with cognitive tutors educational psychology review you can use forward and backward pointers to and from the references these papers to find other potentially relevant papers so can at related web sites like learnlaborg httpaddr how can i verify the integrity of the files you can use the unix program and the following sha to verify the challenge another way to verify the files is to count the number of lines in training and test files add them together and compare this to number of steps reported on the downloads page you can use a command like wc l filename to count the number of lines in file note that the number of steps we report does not include header rows so your number is likely to be greater by one row in each why did you change the row numbering scheme for the challenge this change was intentional our primary concern was that the in the development sets left gaps between the such it was possible to infer how many more steps the student took to the unit by looking at the first row number of the next this numbering scheme eliminates that more specifically it is the gap between the test set of and the training set for that is the an example is shown old numbering gap between and is the student unit student unit student unit student unit student unit new numbering student unit student unit student unit student unit student unit derivable temporal with no gap student unit student unit student unit student unit student unit known noise in the in algebra i the knowledge components of some steps are they no this is incorrect in addition there are other kc names that cut off in similar ways we will fix this but since this issue is present in the development sets it is not a in algebra i some kcs have substring action after done expr subtract in expr solveroperation these names are not a problem the two arguments here are the input for the rule and the actual user input checking the user against the expected input is part of how the rule gets evaluated these cases because they are any action then any input is so the expected input is null in most of these cases the user seems to be null also except for the left indicating that the specified the of the you write that a step row is uniquely identified by this student problem hierarchy problem name problem view step true then why do i see duplicates for this it is true that there are duplicate not unique keys in the data sets we analyzed the development data sets but probably exist there too classify this issue as noise in data there should not be duplicate keys but there are the breakdown shows the extent of these duplicate keys in the files of the two challenge data algebra i training bridge to algebra keys unique keys unique duplicate keys duplicate percentage duplicates of total percentage duplicates the most times a key is duplicated is in the test data we found some rows with problem view values than since problem view is the total number of times the encountered the problem so far and each test row is determined by program that randomly selects one problem for each student within unit how could problem view be larger than when we created the test files we take problem view account so the result is that you may see more than one instance for a single pair in the test file this unintended but need to account for it in your the presence of more than one problem for a pair in test file will always take the form of all steps completed another instance of that same problem you can use the order of rows in the test file and the problem view values to relatively when the student worked on the same problem again note at the boundary between problem views at the point where problem increases the steps surrounding the boundary are not contiguous a student could have worked on the same problem much in in i find that almost every line has same start and end time the step duration is also equal to is unfortunately this is the case for all challenge data set files it is an issue in the raw data and as such we will not be to fix it not known whether the timestamp that is across all four time columns is the step start time step end time something else as we will not be able to correct this issue in data you will need to take it into seen duplicate knowledge components assigned to one step example in row the kc is defined and the opportunity numbers for those kcs the opportunity count just increase over this is a type of noise in the data we know why it occurs should ignore the second kc that is listed as well as its number you are right that for a student the kc opportunity should increase as time goes on and the student encounters steps that can we say for the same student the records along the row id listed along a time index ie for the same student a record with larger row id happens after a record with a smaller row no not a safe assumption for a couple of reasons first clarification about the format a record is a summary one or more student attempts transactions on a step each their own time stamp this means that one refer to a row happening at one time secondly attempts at different steps can interleaved therefore there is no guarantee that a student one step before starting another we can clarify the order of rows in either a training test file the order of these rows is determined by following rule for a given instance of student working on a order the rows by a field called step time which is the time of first correct transaction correct transaction time where given if there is no correct transaction the time of the last transaction the step step end we display this step time value we use it to order if the data is noisy however such as in algebra where same time is given across all time fields for the step and all steps the problem then the sorting within a problem is indeterminate say what order it is in since tried to sort rows based identical criteria similarly ordering problems for a student also be random if the same step time is used for more than one go

during a casualty scenario eg intranasal and intramuscular alternate formulations of existing therapeutics that physical and chemical characteristics that allow them to stockpiled eg longer shelf toxicokinetic and route of administration studies with agents for the purpose of developing better countermeasures eg the ability of a threat agent to cross barrier inhalation versus dermal exposures of a development and validation of in vitro animal models cglp methodology for rapid screening of medical eg seizures in rodents models of direct lung injury from inhaled source animal models of cyanide intoxication skin and of supportive measures and other medical to delay mortality and morbidity until transportation to facilities eg oxygen identification of segments of the general population that are sensitive to chemical safe and effective therapies for pediatric and elderly segments the civilian population or for those individuals with medical conditions animal models that mimic these populations will also be research on the molecular mechanisms of toxicity for the purpose identifying novel targets eg the mechanisms of seizures with respect to temporal and changes roles of cardiac versus neuronal mitochondria in toxicity cellular and molecular basis for research on short and pathophysiology from exposures to threat agents for the specific and purpose of developing

defined in the nih grants policy eligibility the nih will accept as many different applications as the organization chooses however the nih will not accept similar applications with essentially the same research focus from the applicant organization this includes derivative or applications that propose to develop a single product process service that with modifications can be applied to variety of purposes applicants may not simultaneously identical applications under both this opportunity and another hhs foa including the current sbir or parent this foa supports basic and translational research see since the need for new and improved therapeutics priority will be given to those projects that translational in nature with a new therapy that has already identified that needs further development each counteract application must include a clearly stated project timeline includes practical achievable goals and project milestones toward therapeutic intervention are goals that create points in the project including quantitative success criteria awards may be contingent upon negotiations between applicant and the nih whereby milestones are reviewed and progress towards proposed milestones will be a major factor in review and continued funding of type if a specific new therapy has not yet been identified basic should clearly be relevant to the discovery of a new therapy proposal should describe in detail how the proposed research will to the development of a novel therapeutic product and it present milestones related to achieving that goal some of which may future plans outside the scope of the current research any collaborators consultants or subcontractors should be no matter when during the conduct of the activity the interaction occurs it is not required that an investigational new ind or investigational device exemption ide is achieved during first project period but the plan to complete should be presented in the application since translational research intrinsically interdisciplinary this plan will often cooperation among basic researchers and clinicians and may include participation of companies and voluntary consultation with ninds

old as the click to view focus articles cover major weapons acquisition programs and program is more important to the usaf than its aerial tanker renewal in january the big question was whether there be a competition for the proposal covering aircraft and test platforms the total cost for this first alone will exceed billion but aerial tanker demands new planes to replace its whose most recent delivery was in otherwise unpredictable age or fatigue like the ones that grounded its fighters in ground its aerial tankers and with them a substantial slice of total and contracts may follow in subsequent decades in order replace all active ang reserve active as well as the heavy kc tankers that were delivered then again fiscal and demographic realities may mean the plane buy is it for the

claimed lower kc operating costs and received a endorsement eads promised to open production of civilian jets the usa if it the airbus a mrtt was picked as the but an explosive decision brought the competition to a usaf articles took pains to emphasize that the department has through a rigorous review process for and has validated that rfp accurately reflects the requirements as laid out by warfighter the rfp includes specific factors for assessing capability contribution of each offeror along a set of performance that did not stop the contract protests of course and revelations that the usaf had not even followed its own destroyed the the clock ran out on the bush tenure and secretary defense gates decided to give his new employers in the administration an opportunity to chart their own course on this the competition was canceled a rfp was released february but the decision took until february based won that competition and the way they it was simple they underbid on a contract by hundred million dollars below cost in exchange they avoided a dent their prestige kept their production line open opened the door more kc exports ensured a lucrative stream of future maintenance revenue and prevented airbus from gaining a industrial foothold in the development usaf research and development the latest selected acquisition report estimates a development costs of billion which would actually be billion over the emd original target cost of fortunately for the usaf they structured the contract so they pay more than billion and the overall bid cost to the government for development plus production remains below how it up to billion the contract split for amounts over billion is so the government pays million more billion and boeing pays costs above billion are all the current estimate spread shows that almost no chance coming in under billion current cost estimate is billion which would raise its private liability for the cost to million all over if the program manager is right liability rises to million all the pentagon have to care which emd figure is correct or how much higher emd costs go since their are now known if and only if the usaf start asking for

right after the february award had eads bidding billion for the emd phase while boeing had bid billion for the emd phase alone that means the usaf knew of about million beyond its target costs from the outset for an aircraft had not been fielded or tested yet and involved more development than offering that means added risk of future increases but swiftness of these cost revisions strongly

compared to the costs associated with a procurement strategy our product is better congressmen murtha and abercrombie are correct the only way to tankers to the warfighter quickly is through a dual strategy northrop grumman will support the the crunch of course is that more aircraft per year at about million each adds billion per year to actual spending another billion from or billion from the

reports that boeing is considering a refusal to bid as its response to the revised that response would leave the field open to grumman in formal sense but the political weight of that kind of protest would force the pentagon to think long and hard before signing contract under those circumstances until boeing makes a firm of course its bid team must continue working full speed aug new draft the usaf has issued a new draft of its rfp appears to be adopting an approach of minimum required compliance the surface there are major changes fuel costs over a year lifetime will be considered and full credit will now be for exceeding the stated requirements in key areas like cargo fuel offload et al neither was true under the old rfp the catch that different levels of importance are being assigned to various of costs with development and production cost estimates weighted heavily than projections for maintenance and fuel costs second major change around exceeding performance limits simply the original evaluation approach the announced approach instead of a violation of the under those terms boeing is likely to lose again which may trigger protest upon the release of the revised rfp the planned line for moving forward is as aug dod officials will take a week to discuss elements of draft with and boeing expect a lot of back forth over the terms of the rfp including efforts by members the currently recessed dod plans to issue the final rfp amendment with days for renewed submissions note that this time frame make an airframe switch very difficult due to the hundreds pages of

early january decision made and announced if boeing the existing contract is canceled and a new one is signed win again the current order is important to note that the us desired schedule and politics appeals et al actually end up dictating may end up different things on a political level however introducing revised rfp when congress is in recess and not issuing a until after the elections will help to lower elected political leverage what it will not do is provide full since the decision is certain to be an important election issue in states the first days in a new term also tend to some political insulation for issues of this type since members busy with other things nevertheless it can also be a sword exceptions do occur if the issue in question is a big priority for enough elected

how first of all get the right capability we especially wanted make sure that request for a proposal we put out there for a product that we wanted not for a product that ensured competition but for a product we wanted and we worked a lot that over the period thinking about it not only from an air perspective but from a joint perspective as well and i mean feel pretty good about where it came out it was that transparent a development of an rfp as one could ever look always like a competition but having to have competition for something i want is not of interest and know when down to handfuls of always working that balance more competition better than less competition but to have to go to a competition something you want then sends you off into an environment want to be in when we did the mobility capability study one of the we came to as we looked at alternatives in that space was that the nation looked at a tanker that if the price was for doors and floors that the agility that that would create terms of being able to have additional palette additional personnel capability pick up some medical capability additional flexibility in lift that know we do a but in any operation the capability to do palettes and people through more varied types of airplanes was worth a fair amount it building a tanker for but if you could get it for a investment it made a lot of sense to do it by the right now sending lots of palettes to places around the lots of palettes to the theater in particular moving lots people back and forth some of on commercial carriers of on some of hopping on it was very clear not in the first seven days of the conflict the first limited engagement because at that time tankers are their tanker mean principally tankers to be in a sustaining operation over time agility that being able to make them a cargo long as are trying to optimize the airplane as a cargo agility made a lot of sense inherently and analytically pallets on a c is extremely inefficient mean for large cargo not for consider in light of the lexington november fate of huge tanker program could hinge on cargo role however that krieg is still performing the balancing act implementation of his

difference in the taps the government buys airplane which is exactly what happened if there had or less difference the usaf would have been directed to look at optional trade space requirements and their accompanying adjusting the tap accordingly and then buy the each trade space item is worth a certain number of points and either met or not met the one exception is fuel offload which between points as different levels of capability are total extra weight is therefore there are total space points which includes requirements worth points each worth points worth point worth points and points the result would be a new adjusted price and again bid because ifara also ties into fuel burn and additional range and offload capacity do not factor in except through ifara the ifara looked set to be the hinge on which this competition will turn addition all qualified bid teams will have access to the ifara which means one could expect arguments about some of the once the contending teams have crunched their performance through models and gone over the criteria instead boeing decided to more less nullify ifara with a bid price that rendered it on another likely lobbying front the rfp took no with respect to the ongoing trade subsidies dispute the world trade organization this refusal is explicitly stated was fiercely defended and maintain the rfp does include the clause it states that any financial or other assessed by the wto are entirely the responsibility cannot be passed on to the usaf in any b the contenders and the cargo factor air kc cargo usaf click to view during the round competition a was against in a new wrinkle air mobility command brought into the rfp draft process and the usaf said the air force also intends to take full advantage of the capabilities inherent in the platform and make it an integral of the defense transportation both contending aircraft offer substantial improvements over extra capacity for cargo or people in addition to tanker the can carry up to standard l cargo pallets or about medical litters just under of american aerial currently carry cargo loads but that number is likely to increase existing aerial tanker fleet is being handled gently given its age the consequences of structural issues once those issues are however the frequency of current c flights involving people standard pallets rather than heavy cargo will make more flights an attractive despite the fuel a mrtt thales airtanker a mrtt click to view according to the kc official round pdf the derivative can carry up to passengers or medical litters or up to standard l cargo pallets or combination of the above in addition to its full fuel load at pounds capacity it also carries more fuel than the is a particular advantage in the pacific sector with its expanses on the other hand its advanced arbs refueling boom did not actually transfer fuel another aircraft in the air until march competition delays allowed airbus to improve this gap and an a conducted refueling in on the flip side the kc is a larger aircraft than the requires a slightly longer runway at full load takes up footprint on tarmacs and costs more to operate on basis in response team kc stresses costs and on a basis such as deploying a full fighter squadron personnel and equipment or deploying an army combat team transport aircraft with tanker accompaniment they argue that if tanker aircraft with more fuel and cargo space mean fewer required the cost figures may look more equal once the mission tankers are supporting is complete there had also been speculation that airbus might be prepared to offer a very discounted price in order to close the buying price gap between cheaper and the some reports even pegged kc offer as the rfps included more exacting data as each team made its case to usaf as well as final pricing for example fleet effectiveness fev one of the key evaluation criteria designed to communicate aerial refueling performance the kc fleet is the baseline with an fev of calculated over mission scenarios specified by the usaf and using prescribed ramp space and resources air mobility sector paul meyer says the fev submitted with its kc round bid was there had been some talk at northrop grumman of using the freighter version instead as the base aircraft which would be departure from bought to date a switch would add new risk and certification issues as well as fuel efficiency penalties exchange for much better cargo performance aircraft pounds of weight to the base design and fuel capacity by us gallons in exchange for boosting weight capacity by pounds to the type first flew late and began service with uae eithad airways in so far the f has only been suggested as a improvement or variant option after the contract is kc kc pub kc kc round click to view team kc advanced in round used a fuselage freighter wing landing gear cargo door and floor and flaps and flight deck derived in turn from the a boom with remote viewing would expand the effective refueling airspace and offload more fuel engines would be pratt whitney with pounds of thrust the advanced refueling boom had a and had been tested successfully in live refueling night operations on the other hand was a technical risk factor that had undergone almost years redesign and been a persistent problem for the italian tanker that was a potential risk and round optimization had penalized boeing due to the additional risk and certification their kc newgen now the is a sharp contrast as decided not to discuss their features a stance it maintained even after the award this made assessments of round offering inexact and approximate earlier round comments boeing indicated a more standard but pictures and videos appear show lengthened wings and wingtip winglets in order to deal previous flutter issues and add cruise efficiency what is known that boeing is keeping the pw engines the firm still says using a new boom design but the structure is now based the larger kc boom in order to meet the fuel offload target at the same time refueling pods replaced by the same cobham products found on the a mrtt the clear change involved replacement of the derived deck with one from the new dreamliner that includes flight display as their relative capacities demonstrate the kc is a aircraft than the one positive consequence is that it can off from slightly shorter runways the usaf requires the ability take off from an foot runway but would prefer feet as makes more runways available the size can also mean difference between say or aircraft that can fit on the tarmac a forward base boeing touts the kc as cheaper to and maintain than the kc on a basis and its base is cheaper to buy on the civilian based planes can carry up to passengers vs or medical litters ngc patients claim or up to standard l cargo pallets or combination of the above in addition to its full fuel load that is confirmed at pounds slightly above the the claims that its strengthened floors allow the kc to carry a weight of cargo to the a however it would be interesting to validated statistics compared to the boeing could have the in round which is feet longer but their determined that the extra capacity justify the extra and operating expenses that turned out to be a mistake but proceeded to win round with a freighter northrop grumman calculated a round fleet effectiveness value of for the rival kc in round vs for airbus boeing did not release its kc and kc kc refuels click to view for round boeing was openly contemplating a kc depending on the criteria weightings a kc would offer more offloaded fuel than the at nautical with the ability to carry up to passengers vs kc patients vs kc or up to standard l pallets vs kc or some combination of the above addition to its full fuel these statistics are impressive but boeing would have faced hurdles if it wished to offer a one is the cost given the way the rfp is structured has almost certainly run the ifara model to make sure but on the of it the renewed rfp made a kc offering unlikely the on cost and lower value placed on extra points for the additional cargo transport and fuel capabilities made the look like a losing game the nd issue was timeliness unlike kc and a mrtt any kc would have to be designed tested and certified from scratch to add to that timeliness boeing already has a backlog of commercial orders for the that issue leaves boeing with choices that include some combination adding time and risk by investing or partnering to expand production rate convincing commercial customers to accept delays facing constraints on their delivery rate to the kc conversion and in the end those hurdles convinced boeing to offer the kc again with modifications that made it different from the flying for japan and c airbus lost round a mrtt raaf conversion raaf a click to view before its win the mrtt had been ordered by saudi arabia and the united arab emirates as well as unusual
