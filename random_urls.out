http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize this page wikipedia en copyright wikipedia from wikipedia the free jump to navigation the netflix prize was an open competition for the best filtering algorithm to predict user ratings for films based previous ratings without any other information about the users films ie without the users or the films being identified except numbers assigned for the the competition was held by netflix an online service and was open to anyone not connected with netflix current former employees agents close relatives of netflix employees or a resident of cuba iran syria north myanmar or sudan on september the grand prize was given to the pragmatic chaos team bested own algorithm for predicting ratings problem and data progress over the progress progress cancelled privacy see external problem and data netflix provided a training data set of ratings users gave to movies each training rating is quadruplet of the form user movie date of grade user and movie fields are integer ids while grades are from to integral the qualifying data set contains over triplets of form user movie date of grade with grades known only to the a participating algorithm must predict grades on the qualifying set but they are only informed of the score for half of data the quiz set of ratings the other half is the test of and performance on this is used by the jury to potential prize winners only the judges know which ratings are in quiz set and which are in the test arrangement is to make it difficult to hill climb on the test set predictions are scored against the true grades in terms of mean squared error rmse and the goal is to reduce this error as as possible note that while the actual grades are integers in range to submitted predictions need not be netflix identified a probe subset of ratings within the training set the probe quiz and test data sets were chosen to have statistical in summary the data used in the netflix prize looks as training set probe set qualifying set ratings consisting test set ratings used to determine quiz set ratings used to calculate for each movie title and year of release are provided in a dataset no information at all is provided about users in order protect the privacy of customers some of the rating data for customers in the training and qualifying sets have been perturbed in one or more of the following ways deleting inserting alternative ratings and dates and modifying the training set is such that the average user rated over and the average movie was rated by over users but there is variance in the movies in the training set have as as ratings while one user rated over there was some controversy as to the choice of rmse as the metric would a reduction of the rmse by really benefit the it has been claimed that even as small an improvement as results in a significant difference in the ranking of the top recommended movies for a prizes were based on improvement over own algorithm cinematch or the previous score if a team has made beyond a certain threshold a trivial algorithm that predicts for movie in the quiz set its average grade from the training data an rmse of cinematch uses straightforward linear models with a lot of data using only the training data cinematch scores an rmse of on quiz data roughly a improvement over the trivial cinematch has a similar performance on the test set in to win the grand prize of a participating team had improve this by another to achieve on the test such an improvement on the quiz set corresponds to an rmse of as long as no team won the grand prize a progress prize of awarded every year for the best result thus far however in order win this prize an algorithm had to improve the rmse on the quiz set at least over the previous progress prize winner or over the first if no submission succeeded the progress prize was to be awarded for that to win a progress or grand prize a participant had to provide code and a description of the algorithm to the jury within one after being contacted by them following verification the winner had to provide a license to netflix netflix publish only the description not the source code of the system team could choose to not claim a prize in order to keep algorithm and source code secret the jury also kept their secret from other participants a team could send as many attempts predict grades as they wish originally submissions were limited once a week but the interval was quickly modified to once a day best submission so far counted as their current once one of the teams succeeded to improve the rmse by or more jury would issue a last call giving all teams days to send submissions only then the team with best submission was asked for algorithm description source code and license after successful verification declared a grand prize the contest would last until the grand prize winner was declared no one received the grand prize it would have lasted for at least years until october after that date the contest could been terminated at any time at sole progress over the the competition began on october by october a team wxyzconsulting had already beaten by october there were three teams who had beaten cinematch one them by enough to qualify for the annual progress by june over teams had registered for the competition over countries teams had submitted over over

sources these competitions can return plenty of dazzling ideas but they still to fit into an overall research and development the offer of million in prizes to encourage scientists and entrepreneurs to devise new ways of cleaning up ocean oil announced last week highlights the growing use of innovation to find breakthrough solutions for chronic technological and problems while these contests and prizes are not a new their use is increasing with more foundations government and private companies now using them to generate new ideas from a range of more often than not innovation challenges involve a rich purse which teams or individuals compete with their notions of solutions the big prizes often running into hundreds of thousands millions of dollars are designed to get people with ideas about problems to put aside incremental advances and think creatively the matter ie start fresh or attack the problem from a angle the big purse also helps draw attention of the media and to the issues behind the the practice of offering prizes for innovations is hardly new a known historical example is the orteig prize a offered by hotel magnate raymond orteig to the first person to nonstop from new york to paris and won most famously by lindbergh in while lindbergh himself captured the imagination at the time it was his simple approach flying a engine aircraft with only the pilot on board that enabled him leapfrog the competition of larger and more complex undertakings make the first transatlantic the emergence of crowdsourcing the practice of opening up problems issues to the public at large is another reason innovation have become more popular benefactors putting up prize money often answers from outside the normal communities of experts to get new ideas to solve the

miles per a million prize for better cheaper and faster ways to genomes that can lead to personalized another pioneer in innovation challenges is the bill and melinda foundation which offers its grand challenges in global unlike the x prizes that have one or at most a few winners the challenges award a series of grants for breakthrough aimed alleviating major global health issues but even this

in july electric ge and four venture capital companies teamed up to million for innovative ideas on building the next generation grid some will be given in awards for submissions superior entrepreneurship and innovation but the big money is for the submitted ideas ge and the venture capital companies are worth developing and the real work of goes while innovation challenges can grab headlines and generate ideas the work of research and development goes an operation normally entails steady progress rather than grand slam breakthroughs building on a known of work and often taking into account regulatory requirements such health and safety and while many of the innovation challenge prizes are generous are dwarfed by the ongoing spending of business and government national science foundation estimates that in the last year which data are available american companies spent some billion on worldwide with billion of that spent in the for the federal government long considered the funding for basic research in the fiscal year that begins on federal agencies are requesting nearly billion for this scale of private and government spending on is innovation today but largely in the traditional incremental the task for companies and agencies is to combine the energy creativity of innovation challenges with the work of the ongoing enterprise no formula for putting together the two but some organizations have initiatives that try to capture least the spirit of innovation challenges these programs open the to different ideas or methods from sources other than the suspects while the mainstream programs national institutes of health nih the largest government funder biomedical research reserves part of its grant portfolio for what calls its high risk research program to encourage ideas investigators that break away from the normal paradigms two of three opportunities under this program the pioneer and new awards support individual researchers with unusual or creative rather than research projects a sharp break from normal way doing business the third opportunity called transformative r r the designation for main funding vehicle supports projects those

http://www.wifcon.com/anal/analcomproc.htm home contents discussions blog search search httpaddr search httpaddr processes in government contracting the far part and process by vernon j april boiled down to its essence choosing a contractor in a acquisition is a matter of information processing the collects information about alternative choices competing assesses each alternative on the basis of specified evaluation factors and then compares each alternative to the on the basis of those assessments in order to rank them and which is best the process is essentially the same no matter method of contracting is used ordering against a gsa multiple schedule simplified acquisition sealed bidding negotiation or opportunity under a multiple award delivery or task order when planning a competitive acquisition agency acquisition must design a process for getting information about the assessing each alternative and comparing the alternatives in order determine which is best in developing their process they must into account their objectives for process quality schedule and they must consider the attributes of a good decision the available to make it and the human and technological resources computers and decision support software at their disposal they want to minimize their transaction costs by making the decision they can in the shortest reasonable time and using no more their resources than absolutely necessary they also want to economize on the demands made on the competing firms so as not make government business unattractive to the best firms by it too costly and a review of protest decisions by the us general accounting gao and the literature on government contracting suggests that agencies fail to design efficient competitive processes because follow a poor process model that model has evolved over the course years in connection with source selections conducted under acquisition regulation far part contracting by negotiation its predecessors i shall refer to this model as the far part process the far part process the far has never prescribed a process for conducting source selection instead it has prescribed rules governing the of source selection processes the current rules in the far organizing for source selection preparing and requests for proposals and amendments thereto and exchanging information prospective and actual offerors and submitting receiving handling modifying and revising proposals and evaluating proposals and making selection decision far expressly states that describes only some of the processes and techniques that agencies use to conduct a source nevertheless by the end of the s a model process had within the federal procurement bureaucracy that has been passed down succeeding generations of acquisition personnel through word of training and classroom instruction the main steps that process model are set forth in table agency issues a request for proposals that solicits proposals from all agency receives competing agency convenes a panel or set of panels to evaluate the panels evaluate all proposals on the basis of the complete set evaluation factors for panels report their findings to the decisionmaker in decisionmaker either a selects the contractor or b establishes competitive range that includes all of the most highly agency negotiates conducts discussions with the agency asks remaining competitors to submit final proposal agency receives final proposal agency convenes panels to evaluate final proposal panels evaluate all final proposal panels report their findings to the decisionmaker in decisionmaker selects the decisionmaker announces the award table the far part process this process model has two key characteristics every competitor required to submit a complete proposal at the outset of the which addresses all of the evaluation factors for award and agency conducts negotiations with more than one firm the of these two characteristics lies in the effect that they have on amount of information that a competitor must prepare and submit that an agency must process in order to make a source decision and on the time and resources required to prepare and that soliciting complete proposals from all competitors the first characteristic of the far part process model is that all must submit complete proposals at the outset of the suppose that an agency plans to select the contractor on the basis a technical approach b management plan c experience d performance e small small disadvantaged and businesses subcontracting plan and f price under the far part process model the agency will require all the competitors to information pertinent to all of those factors at the outset it require every competitor to submit a technical proposal management proposal information about its experience information about its past performance its plan for small disadvantaged and small business subcontracting and prices and supporting price information as a consequence of approach the evaluation panel must assess every competitor on basis of all of that as a general rule the more information that an evaluation panel process the more time personnel that it will need in order process it and the more information that the decisionmaker will to consider when he or she compares the competitors to determine is best it is generally not too difficult to process complete information received from two to five competitors depending on amount of information solicited and this approach saves time by complete proposals ready at hand for the evaluators at the outset the competition and avoiding the need to pause while successive submissions but it can be a challenge to process information from ten competitors and the challenge can be great an agency receives proposals from or more competitors in cases the challenge can even be overwhelming thus in at least cases the process would be more efficient if agencies limited amount of information that the competitors must submit initially thus the amount of information that the evaluators must process and decisionmaker must consider so long as the limitations are with good decisionmaking practices one way to do that is to limit number of evaluation factors another way to do it is to apply evaluation factors in phases in order to progressively narrow competitive field asking the competitors in each phase to submit the information needed in that phase in this way an agency initially ask for limited information eliminate some competitors that basis and carry fewer competitors into subsequent phases in more detailed and voluminous information is obtained and this type of phased evaluation process is sometimes referred to downselect or negotiations with multiple competitors another source of processing costs is conducting negotiations discussions with than one firm although the far permits agencies to award contracts the basis of initial offers without negotiations agencies sometimes establish a competitive range consisting of than one competitor negotiate with them all and then competitive final proposal revisions from them the panel must then evaluate those revisions and report their to the far states that when establishing a competitive range agency must include all of the most highly rated proposals the proposals included in the competitive range the more information the agency will have to process and the more time and resources will used in the source selection process in the explanatory statement accompanied the federal register publication of the far part rewrite the far council we also note that comments received from government indicate that award is nearly always made to one of the three highly rated offerors in the competitive range the incidence award to an offeror other than one of the three such proposals is small that it does not support keeping any business particularly small business with limited bid and proposal resources in competition that the business has virtually no chance far states that in the interests of efficiency may include fewer than all of the most highly rated proposals in competitive range if they include a notice of that possibility in rfp agencies may also establish a competitive range that includes one offeror historically the gao has been skeptical when agency has established a competitive range consisting of only offeror and has said that it will subject such decisions to scrutiny if it receives a protest in that regard however there evidence that it has backed away from that stance since the far part rewrite took effect on january in sum the provide plenty of latitude to keep the number in the competitive small it seems that there is little reason to include more than in most aside from the information processing costs associated with with more than one competitor there is some evidence that with more than one firm during a source selection does not produce true meeting of the minds a government rfp is a very business document an rfp for a item contract in excess of routinely contains more than far clauses and many specifications and statements of work are written competitors must often read rfps and prepare their in haste and without an opportunity to sit down with government to go through the rfp to ensure a common understanding the terms in order to reach a true meeting of the the parties should fully discuss all terms and conditions in an to ensure that they understand them in the same however contracting officers have long been cautious to the point being when negotiating with more than one firm largely to concerns about fairness and improper disclosure of information but perhaps also due to the pressures of time the of board and court decisions suggests that when conducting procurements agencies do not always discuss the specification statement of work and the contract clauses in sufficient detail reach a true meeting of the minds negotiations are too often to deficiencies and weaknesses in proposals apparently based the assumption that the parties share a common understanding of terms and conditions all too often it is only after contract that the parties learn that they have different ideas about respective rights and obligations thus competitive are sometimes ineffective in producing a meeting of the minds the far permits negotiations between the government and successful competitor after selection but before award negotiations are not contemplated in the far part process model there is little evidence that agencies make much use of that to ensure that the parties really agree on the contract the far part process model in having considered the two key characteristics of the far part process model solicitation of complete proposals from every at the outset of the competition and negotiation with competitors i will now consider three examples of the model action in which it has resulted in competitive process i will describe its application to a source selection under far to a gsa multiple award schedule and to an acquisition under far part simplified acquisition procedures i will discuss its application when providing contractors under multiple task order contracts a fair opportunity to be competitive negotiation source selection under far part the case of the department of procurement for the of governmentwide acquisition contracts for its commerce technology solutions program that procurement was subject of a protest that was sustained by the us general office the solicitation described only evaluation factors past performance team composition and price past performance was comprised of two subfactors a and b past performance management competitors were to present some of the information about the subfactor past performance management described as the tools techniques used in previous work and the results obtained in oral presentation the rfp stated that the agency intended give each competitor an opportunity to make an oral the agency was surprised to receive more than proposals and so decided to narrow the field by eliminating some on the basis of competitiveness here is how the gao described the winnowing in performing this review the sseb chairs assigned letter from to c under the two past performance subfactors and a or under the team composition factor agency report a memorandum for ssa concerning clarification and streamlining proposal evaluation guide and processes may narrative explanations for these ratings were prepared as originally contemplated by the proposal evaluation guide comments at an initial screening matrix prepared for each functional area that ranked offerors according their relative ratings under the qrc subfactor this document noted each rating under the ppm subfactor and composition factor and each average loaded hourly rate hearing exh initial screening evaluation the officer reviewed the average loaded labor rates realism and reasonableness all of the average rates determined to be reasonable declaration of contracting oct at comments at for each functional area the sseb chairs recommended based upon the qrc subfactor ratings a that provide for a sufficient competition agency exh source selection report as an example for the functional area the agency received proposals and were rated as or better under the qrc hearing exh initial screening evaluation the sseb chairs briefed the two who were acting jointly concerning the results of the screening and recommended to the ssas that only those offerors received a or higher under the qrc subfactor be permitted to an oral presentation although the sseb chairs informed the ssas the significance of the letter ratings there was no discussion the specifics underlying each rating hearing testimony sseb the ssas agreed with the recommendations no documentation was prepared memorializing the of or decision to limit the competition to those offers that highest rated under the qrc subfactor id price was not in determining which offerors would be invited to make an presentation id declaration of contracting officer oct at declaration of sseb oct at and proposals under the ise area received b under the qrc subfactor and on that basis the protesters were invited to make oral footnotes omitted the agency apparently applied this process to than kathpal and computer management protested that by using procedure to eliminate them the agency had violated the terms of rfp because they had not been permitted to make oral presentations promised the gao sustained the protest on the grounds that a agency did not really evaluate price which must be evaluated in source selection and b the agency did not let the protesters oral presentations which it had promised it would do the gao that the agency could have amended the rfp to permit phased and progressive narrowing of the field of once it realized how many firms were interested in competing agency could have elected to amend the solicitation to eliminate oral presentation and perhaps even one of the evaluation factors subfactors from the initial thus agencies may evaluate proposals in phases and had the agency this case planned for a phased evaluation and described that process its rfp or provided in the rfp for phased evaluation as a procedure its process would have been more efficient and there not have been a protest or the protest would have been two hundred proposals is of course an unusually large number even if the number is only a phased process that quickly reduces the number to between three and five be more efficient than the far part process model and save time resources for both the government and some of the competitors in cases the number could almost certainly be reduced simply by prices before considering any other factors and eliminating whose prices are too it stands to reason that if agencies can economize on their information processing costs by evaluating competitors in phases progressively narrowing the field then they can economize bid and proposal costs by soliciting proposal in phases asking for detailed and voluminous information only those competitors who survive the early phases of the process in an acquisition in which an agency anticipates receiving large number of proposals phased solicitation and evaluation make for a more efficient less and more competitive orders against gsa schedules whatever the advantages and of the far part process model it is understandable that follow it when conducting source selections under far part what remarkable and more difficult to understand is why they follow it when the rules in far part do not apply eg selecting a contractor for placement of an order against a gsa award schedule and when conducting simplified in the past few years the gao has decided several protests in agencies followed the far part process model when using gsa award schedules far prescribes procedures placing orders against gsa schedules in excess of the threshold but within the maximum order threshold need only review catalogs or pricelists of at least three contractors and select the one that they think represents the value at its website the gsa prescribes special procedures ordering services that require a statement of work procedures are as a when ordering services ordering offices prepare a request request for quote or other i a statement of work a statement of work preferred that outlines at a minimum the work to be location of work period of performance deliverable applicable standards acceptance criteria and any requirements ie security clearances travel special etc should be ii the request should include the statement of work and the contractors to submit either a price or a price to provide the services outlined in the statement of work price order shall be requested unless the office makes a determination that it is not possible at the time placing the order to estimate accurately the extent or duration the work or to anticipate cost with any reasonable degree confidence when such a determination is made a labor hour quote may be requested the shall be based on the prices in the schedule contract and consider the mix of labor categories and level of effort required perform the services described in the statement of work price of the order should also include any travel or other direct charges related to performance of the ordered unless the order provides for reimbursement of travel at the rates provided in the federal travel or joint regulations a ceiling price must be established for iii the request may ask the contractors if necessary appropriate to submit a project plan for performing the task information on the experience past performing similar iv the request shall notify the contractors what basis will used for selecting the contractor to receive the order the shall include the basis for determining whether the contractors technically qualified and provide an explanation regarding intended use of any experience past performance in determining technical qualification of transmit the request to contractors based upon an evaluation of catalogs and price lists the ordering office identify the contractors that appear to offer the best considering the scope of services offered pricing and factors such as locations as appropriate and the request as i the request shall be provided to at least three if the proposed order is estimated to exceed the threshold but not exceed the maximum order ii for proposed orders exceeding the maximum order threshold request shall be provided to an appropriate number of contractors that offer services that will meet the iii in addition the request shall be provided to any who specifically requests a copy of the request for the iv ordering offices should strive to minimize the costs associated with responding to requests for quotes for orders requests should be tailored to the minimum level for adequate evaluation and selection for order placement presentations should be considered when evaluate responses and select the contractor to receive order after responses have been evaluated against the identified in the request the order should be placed with schedule contractor that represents the best value see far those procedures do not require issuance of the rfq to all contractors the establishment of a competitive range or with all offerors within the competitive range rules in far part which are not applicable to the selection of a contractor under a multiple award schedule yet we know that agencies have followed the far part process model even when far part did apply to the in its decision in the matter of inc the describes a procurement in which the immigration and service ins sought to award a blanket purchase agreement for mail and records management services against multiple schedule for document management services and products agency issued a request for quotations on june the asked quoters to submit extensive technical and price information gao describes the scheme as offerors were required to submit separate technical and proposals for evaluation by a technical evaluation committee and a business evaluation committee bec respectively were to clearly demonstrate the understanding of overall and specific requirements of the proposed bpa and proposal in which material information requested was not or where indirect or incomplete answers or information were might be considered unacceptable rfq offerors were to submit both hard and electronic copies of their proposals rfp award was to be made to the offeror whose proposal represented best value to the government based on three evaluation technical approach past performance and price the approach and past performance factors were equally weighted and two combined were significantly more important than price rfq of the two equally important technical approach estimating model and management only the former is at issue offerors were required to submit an estimating model that stated underlying assumptions and constraints of their method accomplishing the work under orders issued against the bpa the statistical basis for their estimates and explain how derived their technical approach from the analysis of the sow multiple years of workload data supplied by ins offerors required to explain illustrate and explicate their model how the workload associated with each of the many forms under the program built to a model for the technical approach operating each service center and the direct mail program as whole failure to do so was to be taken as a lack of of the technical requirement and a deficient technical approach the rfq listed specific criteria under which ins to evaluate this estimating model to assess the to provide the required services rfq under one offerors were required to show how using the ins estimates forecasted demand and their own allocation and employment of assets using available data would result in an workforce under another criterion offerors were required explain their methods and rationale for allocating labor among functional areas such as filing mailroom operations and entry given the forecasted demand id estimates forecasted demand were based upon the historical data amendment no at question and answer nos pricing tables rfq attach reports c offerors were required to submit price proposals that included sections relevant to this protest first offerors were to an explanation of pricing that described all assumptions made constraints affecting price as well as the price methodology second offerors were to complete electronic tables in accordance with specific instructions these tables which were to serve as the mechanism by which ins under the bpa were built upon estimates forecasted demand third offerors were to provide a priced of the estimating model developed in their technical proposals models submitted for both the technical and price proposals required to be the same except that the model submitted for technical proposal could not contain any labor rates or offerors were required to electronically link the estimating model to the pricing tables in a manner that would ins to see how their proposed price was determined rfq price was to be evaluated for price reasonableness and cost as well as total evaluated price ins was to conduct its analysis using one or more of the techniques specified in acquisition regulation far and its cost analysis in accordance with far ins might also any proposal that was unreasonable or materially unbalanced as prices for basic and year quantities the rfq defined unbalanced proposal as one that incorporated prices less than cost for some items prices that are overstated for other items rfq the agency established an evaluation board which included a selection advisory council a technical evaluation panel and business evaluation committee it received four proposals on august completed the initial evaluations on august established competitive range conducted discussions with three offerors received final proposal revisions on october it then another offeror and reopened discussions with the remaining two amended the rfq and received another round of final proposal on november it awarded the bpa an ordering agreement not order against the gsa schedule contract on january six after it had issued its rfq the loser protested and the gao denied protest on april the protest decision is pages in deciding the protest the gao made the following as a preliminary matter the rfq stated that ins intended to issue bpa against the gsa fss contract accordingly provisions of far subpart apply here those anticipate that agencies will review federal schedules and place an order directly with the schedule that can provide the supplies or services that represent the value and meet the needs far sys group inc b mar cpd at where as here the agency intends to use the responses as the basis of a detailed technical evaluation tradeoff it may elect as ins did here to use approach that is like a competition in a negotiated where an agency takes such an approach and a protest is filed will review the actions to ensure that the evaluation reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation fed sys b jan cpd this rfq specifically stated that the source evaluation was be conducted and selection made in accordance with the set forth in the far and set forth specific procedures for evaluation of proposals accordingly while the provisions of part which govern contracting by negotiation do not apply computer prods inc b may cpd at we analyze contentions by the standards applied negotiated procurements digital sys group inc footnote when ordering under a gsa schedule why follow the far part model and thus submit to judgment under the case law thereto when the far and the gsa permit the use of simpler procedures why issue a request for quotations which requires that competitors prepare extensive technical and price proposals establish a complex evaluation organization why determine competitive range why conduct two rounds of discussions and proposal revisions why take six months to award an ordering contracts were already established and full and open competition already been obtained it was just a matter of choosing among the contractors why not instead just issue a statement work ask for quotes and experience and past performance pick a contractor and then negotiate the terms of the bpa including final pricing formulas one can find several cases among the decisions of the simplified acquisitions some agencies follow the far part model even when conducting simplified acquisitions agencies can the simplified acquisition procedures described in far part to contracts valued at up to and up to million for for commercial items yet there are several cases on record of using the far part process model to conduct in its protest decision in the matter of finlen complex inc the describes an army procurement of meals lodging and transportation military service applicants coming to the military entrance station meps in butte montana the army wanted to establish requirements contract with a local hotel to obtain those since the procurement was for a commercial item valued at less than million the army decided to use simplified acquisition procedures permitted by far the contracting officer issued a request for proposals which the described as the rfp here issued to implement a procurement described on cover sheet as a commercial acquisition simplified acquisition procedures anticipated award of requirements contract for a period followed by four year options to the offeror proposal was considered most advantageous to the government rfp the rfp advised that offers would be evaluated on quality food and transportation proposal facility quality control past performance and price factors id the also advised that the factors would be important than cost or price id otherwise the rfp was silent the relative weight of the evaluation factors the rfp also silent on the role in the selection decision of any evaluation factor other than past performance as for the role past performance the solicitation set forth considerable including how the agency would use the past performance and what it would consider although not disclosed to offerors the relative weights set for this procurement facility quality percent food and transportation facility location percent quality control percent and performance percent agency report ar tab the agency received proposals from six hotels it established a member team which evaluated the proposals and wrote pages of and a consensus report the contracting representative wrote a decision document for the contracting signature incumbent contractor protested and the gao sustained the the protester argued that the selection decision was unfair because solicitation was misleading about the relative importance of evaluation factors making past performance seem much more than it really was the army countered by saying that the rfp silent about the relative importance of the factors and that far and say that agencies are not required disclose the relative importance of evaluation factors in of commercial items when using simplified acquisition procedures gao sustained the protest anyway with respect to the contention that since this on its face is identified as a commercial item procurement simplified acquisition procedures no further analysis is needed disagree we look to the substance of an actions than the form in our view the labeling of a procurement simplified does not absolve the agency from its obligation treat vendors fairly see comark fed sys b jan cpd at use of a procurement approach rather than a simple federal supply purchase triggered requirement to provide for a fair and while there is no dispute here that the procurement of meals hotel rooms for meps applicants appears to squarely within the reach of a commercial item as that term defined at far there is little about the procedures used this procurement that can reasonably be called simplified example the agency elected to use a request for proposal that requires the commercial offerors prepare proposals addressing five evaluation including one factor quality control for which offerors had develop and submit a unique quality control plan contracting officer approval of plan changes throughout the life the contract fn upon receipt of offers agency conducted a evaluation inspected developed consensus scores and made a written recommendation to the meps commander who in turn recommended selection decision to the contracting officer who in turn and documented the despite the simplified label this procurement is very similar any other negotiated acquisition conducted under the rules set in far part those rules require that when offerors are asked prepare detailed proposals those offerors must be advised of weight of all factors and significant subfactors that will the contract award far when our office asked the to address why it would want to withhold this basic information offerors preparing proposals the agency answered that the relative importance of factors may result in offerors their proposals to the more important factors agency supp at in addition the army argued that revealing the weight of factors in the solicitation would hinder the ability to change the weight of those factors during the course its evaluation id in our view neither of these considerations appropriate under the circumstances of this or any procurement nor are they advisable for the integrity of the procurement we recognize that cica exempts solicitations in procurements simplified procedures from the requirement that the importance of evaluation factors be disclosed usc moreover we are sensitive to the fact that the of far parts and is to avoid the use of procedures constrict and complicate the acquisition process and that far and do not on their face limit contracting discretion to disclose or not disclose relative weight of evaluation criteria in a commercial procurement conducted using simplified procedures basic principles of fair play are a touchstone of the procurement system and those principles bound even broad grants agency discretion see intellectual properties inc supra here where the agency required the commercial offerors to detailed proposals addressing unique government withholding the relative weight of evaluation factors denied offerors one of the basic tools used to develop the detailed proposals called for in the in short calling an acquisition simplified does not make it so is not what you say you are doing that counts it is what you do why did the army prepare and issue an rfp require competing to prepare and submit written proposals establish an evaluation and have that board prepare pages of notes and an evaluation none of that is required by far part a search of an american automobile club aaa website yielded a list ten hotels in butte montana why not have the meps commander prepare checklist based on its requirements for food lodging transportation and then have one or two members of the detachment all ten hotels in butte and complete a checklist for each this be done in one or two days why not then have the meps commander to the contracting officer the names of three hotels that meet needs and with which they would be willing to do business contracting officer could then contact the three hotel managers fax email a copy of the rfq to each of them and ask them to fax or price quotes based on the price quotes the contracting officer consultation with the meps commander could pick the hotel represents the best value and negotiate an agreement on contract and conditions the entire contractor selection process and could have been completed in a week or the fair opportunity process under multiple award delivery and order contracts far requires that when placing against multiple award delivery and task order contracts agencies provide each awardee a fair opportunity to be considered for order in excess of far expressly states the source selection procedures in far subpart do not apply this process the fair opportunity process is not subject protest so there are no gao decisions which illustrate the use of far part process model therein nevertheless there is anecdotal and documentary evidence that some agencies have conducting what are essentially selections when awardees a fair opportunity some industry associations have about the bid and proposal costs associated with such and some agencies have published formal guidance for providing a opportunity process which reflects the far part process model for example the guidance issued by the national institutes of information technology acquisition and assessment center information and partners innovations task order guidelines march that guidance provides the solicitation of complete task order proposals from all awardees even discussions with multiple awardees prior to the award of task again the question must be asked why follow the far part model when the far permits the use of a much simpler and more process why ask for complete proposals from all awardees when far does not require that this be done and why discussions with more than one contractor surely there must be simpler way to choose a contractor from among firms that have been evaluated and awarded a contract a way that is less costly for both the government and the some best practices in competitive process one of an acquisition most important tasks is efficient competitive processes while the far part process model suitable for many acquisitions that fall under far part it is cumbersome and costly procedure to use when there numerous competitors and an unnecessarily complex procedure to when ordering from gsa schedules making simplified acquisitions giving offerors a fair opportunity to be considered deliver and task order contracts not even the new procedures for ordering services under gsa schedules and task contracts require contracting officers to follow the far part process as indicated by the kathpal decision even when conducting a part source selection there is no need to require complete information from every competitor at the outset or to evaluate offeror based on every evaluation factor agencies may solicit information and evaluate the competitors in phases narrowing the competitive field based on limited information obtaining detailed and voluminous information from only a acquisition personnel should design their competitive processes comply with statute and regulation to yield good decisions and economize on agency transaction costs and competitor bid and costs acquisition personnel should not follow the far part model without first considering alternative processes instead appropriate they should innovate to develop more efficient in that regard consider the following guiding principle of the acquisition system as set forth in far the far outlines procurement policies and procedures that are by members of the acquisition team if a policy or procedure or particular strategy or practice is in the best interest of government and is not specifically addressed in the far prohibited by law statute or case law executive order or regulation government members of the team should not assume it prohibited rather absence of direction should be interpreted permitting the team to innovate and use sound business judgment is otherwise consistent with law and within the limits of authority contracting officers should take the lead in business process innovations and ensuring that business are some best practices in competitive process design include limit the number of evaluation factors it is the number evaluation factors that determines the amount of information must be obtained from competitors and processed by the in order to reach a decision therefore use no more factors than absolutely necessary and only those factors on the differences among offerors are likely to be more limit the amount of proposal information required from as a general rule and especially when acquiring services do make offerors write technical or management narratives describing how they will do the work or how they organize or quality assurance and safety etc such writings are and costly to prepare and evaluate but they do not necessarily demonstrate a to perform and usually are not binding in any meaningful moreover incorporating such writings into a contract inconsistent with service contracting policy agency technical personnel want to obtain insights how well the competitors understand the work require presentations instead of written technical or use the far part process model in source selections only when is most effective when conducting source selections under far use the far part process model when five or fewer are expected and when obtaining complete proposals from offerors at the outset of the competition will save consider phased submission of information and proposal when conducting source selections under far part and when is a realistic likelihood of receiving more than five consider soliciting proposal information and evaluating in phases alternatively consider planning to use evaluation as a contingency do not follow the far part process model when ordering from schedules when using special ordering procedures services that require a statement of work do not follow the part process model and do not use far part terminology competitive range or discussions or refer to far part the rfq agencies should conduct market select at least three contractors to solicit based on past performance and perhaps an informal interview provide firms with a statement of work by fax or email and ask for quotes then choose one firm with which to negotiate the terms the order or blanket purchase agreement defense agencies with dfars and expecting a large number of to their fair notice of intent should request limited experience past performance and price quote at the outset of competition and progressively narrow the competitive field asking for more detailed proposal information except in circumstances pick one contractor and then negotiate the of the order or blanket purchase agreement do establish a competitive range negotiate with more than one firm a time or solicit revised proposals from more than one do not follow the far part process model when making acquisitions when using simplified acquisition procedures to complex supplies or services worth in excess of and which a synopsis must be published and if planning to ask for information than just a price quote either a select one for negotiations based on experience past and a price quote and then negotiate to agreement on details b narrow the competitive field of competitors on the basis experience past performance and a price quote before asking more detailed proposal information providing a specification statement of work and clauses for price quote development by fax email do not use far part terminology or refer to far part in the rfq do not establish a competitive range negotiate more than one firm at a time or solicit revised quotes or from more than one do not follow the far part process model when giving under a multiple award delivery or task order contract a opportunity to be considered maintain a dossier on each reflecting its performance under task orders and any qualifications that it may have demonstrated during when the time comes to issue an order send a draft of the order each contractor and ask for a price quotation choose contractor for negotiations based on its performance its price quote and if appropriate its qualifications negotiate the details of the order with contractor if you cannot reach a satisfactory agreement then back and choose one of the other contractors for negotiation not solicit complete proposals from every contractor establish competitive range negotiate with more than one contractor at time or solicit revised quotes or offers from more than our government is heavily dependent upon contractors to do work that not inherently governmental and it is going to become even more so the future this means that effective acquisition management is to good government in turn the design of efficient processes is essential to effective acquisition management in this era of urgent needs and ever more limited staff while the far part process model works well in many it is not always the most efficient process and thus does not reflect best practice acquisition professionals must innovate designing competitive processes in order to economize on transaction costs and contractor bid and proposal costs and obtain value efficiently and within a reasonable amount

necessary and it may not be possible negotiate a price that is in accord with all the opinions or with the contracting objective the contracting officer is responsible for exercising requisite judgment and is solely responsible for the final decision the recommendations and counsel of contributing including auditors are advisory only however the contracting should include comments in the price negotiation memorandum significant audit or other specialist recommendations are not d the contracting primary concern is the price government actually pays the eventual cost and profit fee should be a secondary concern the contracting is to negotiate a contract of a type and with a price providing contractor the greatest incentive for efficient and performance the negotiation of a contract type and a price are and should be considered together with the issues of risk uncertainty to the contractor and the government therefore contracting officer should not become preoccupied

competition see exception standards at b of this ii established catalog or market prices of commercial items sold substantial quantities to the general public see exception at paragraph b of this subsection iii prices set by law or regulation see exception standards paragraph b of this for acquisition of a commercial item if the contracting does not have sufficient information to support an exception paragraph a of this subsection but the contracting officer determine the price is fair and reasonable see exception standards paragraph b of this subsection and pricing requirements for exceptional cases where a waiver has been granted exception standards at paragraph b of this subsection for modifications to contracts or subcontracts for items if the basic contract or subcontract was awarded without submission of cost or pricing data because the action was granted exception from cost or pricing data requirements under paragraph of this subsection and the modification does not change the contract subcontract to a contract or subcontract for the acquisition of than a commercial item see exception standards at paragraph b this b standards for exceptions from cost or pricing adequate price competition a price is based adequate price competition i two or more responsible offerors competing independently priced offers responsive to the expressed requirement a award will be made to a responsible offeror whose proposal the greatest value see to the government and price is substantial factor in source selection the lowest evaluated price b there is no finding that the price of the otherwise offeror is unreasonable any such finding must be supported by statement of the facts and approved at a level above the ii there was a reasonable expectation based on market research other assessment that two or more responsible offerors independently would submit priced offers responsive to expressed requirement even though only one offer received from a responsible responsive offeror and a based on the offer received the contracting officer can conclude that the offer was submitted with the expectation competition eg circumstances indicate the offeror believed that at least one other offeror was capable submitting a meaningful responsive offer the offeror had no reason to believe that other potential did not intend to submit an offer b the determination that the proposed price is based on price competition and is reasonable is approved at a level above contracting officer iii price analysis clearly demonstrates that the proposed price reasonable in comparison with current or recent prices for the same similar items purchased in comparable quantities under terms and conditions under contracts that resulted from adequate established catalog or market established price established catalog prices are prices including prices recorded in a catalog price list schedule or verifiable and established record that a are regularly maintained the manufacturer or vendor and b are published or available for customer ii established market price an established market price is a that is established in the course of ordinary and usual trade buyers and sellers free to bargain and that can be substantiated data from sources independent of the iii based on a price may also be based on an established catalog market price if the item or class of items being purchased is itself a catalog or market priced commercial item but is similar to the catalog or market priced commercial item to ensure any difference in prices can be identified and justified resorting to cost iv sold in substantial quantities an item is sold in quantities if there are sales of more than a nominal quantity based the norm of the industry segment in determining what constitutes substantial quantity the contracting officer should consider things as the size of the market and how recently the item introduced into the market models samples prototypes experimental units are not substantial quantities for services to sold in substantial quantities they must also be customarily by the offeror using personnel regularly employed and equipment any is necessary regularly maintained principally to provide a the method used to establish sales may be sales order shipment invoice actual recorded sales or other records so long the method used is consistent provides an accurate indication of activity and is verifiable if the item would not otherwise for an exception sales of the item by affiliates may be considered addition sales of essentially the same commercial item by manufacturers or vendors may be considered in determining whether are substantial provided that the price of those sales is considered data to support sales quantities may also come from manufacturers industry associations or marketing groups financial reports b an exception may apply for an item based on the market price of item regardless of the quantity of sales of the item previously made the offeror or the types of customers for these sales provided sales of the same or similar items by other sellers meet the v general public the general public ordinarily consists of other than the us government or its instrumentalities eg government corporations sales to the general public do not sales to affiliates of the offerors or purchases by the us on behalf of foreign governments such as for foreign military if the contracting officer can determine without requiring from the offeror that sales are for government end use these need not be considered sales to the general prices set by law or regulation pronouncements in the form periodic rulings reviews or similar actions of a governmental or embodied in the laws are sufficient to set a commercial items for acquisition of a commercial item if contracting officer does not have sufficient information to support exception under or a the contracting officer grant an exception for a contract subcontract or modification of contract or subcontract if the contracting officer obtains the information described in cost or pricing data may obtained for such a commercial item only if the contracting makes a written determination that the pricing information inadequate for performing a price analysis and determining exceptional cases the head of the contracting activity without power of delegation waive the requirement for submission cost or pricing data the authorization for the waiver and the for granting it shall be in writing a waiver may be considered another exception does not apply but the price can be determined to fair and reasonable without submission of cost or pricing data example if cost or pricing data were furnished on previous buys and the contracting officer determines such data are when combined with updated information a waiver may be granted if head of the contracting activity has waived the requirement submission of cost or pricing data the contractor or subcontractor to whom the waiver relates shall be considered as been required to make available cost or pricing data award of any subcontract expected to exceed the cost pricing data threshold requires the submission of cost or pricing unless an exception otherwise applies to the modifications this exception only applies when the contract or subcontract was exempt from cost or pricing data based adequate price competition catalog or market price or price set law or regulation for modifications of contracts subcontracts for commercial items the exception at applies if the modification does not change the item from a item to a noncommercial item however if the modification to contract or a subcontract changes the nature of the work under contract or subcontract either by a change to the commercial item or the addition of other noncommercial work the contracting officer not prohibited from obtaining cost or pricing data for the added c special circumstances when purchasing commercial items it not necessary to obtain information supporting an exception for line item sampling techniques may be if the us government has acted favorably on an exception for the same or similar items the contracting officer may consider prior submissions as support for the current exception request from the submission of new information does not relieve the officer from the requirement to determine reasonableness of price the current when acquiring by separate contract an item included on an federal supply service or information technology service multiple schedule contract the contracting officer should grant an and not require documentation if the offeror has provided proof that exception has been granted for the schedule item price analysis be performed in accordance with to determine reasonableness the contracting officer and offeror may make special for the submission of exception requests for repetitive these arrangements can take any form as long as they set forth effective period and the exception criteria at are such arrangements may be extended to other government offices their d requesting an exception in order to qualify for an other than an exception for adequate price competition from requirements to submit cost or pricing data the offeror must submit written request the solicitation provision at or methods may be used it is the responsibility of the officer to determine based on the information submitted and any information available to the contracting officer which exception any requiring cost or pricing a pursuant to usc a and usc b cost or data shall be obtained only if the contracting officer concludes none of the exceptions in applies however if the officer has sufficient information available to determine reasonableness then a waiver under the exception at should be considered the threshold for obtaining cost or pricing is this amount will be subject to adjustment october and every five years thereafter unless an applies cost or pricing data are required before accomplishing any the following actions expected to exceed the threshold in effect on date of agreement on price or the date of award whichever is or in the case of existing contracts the threshold specified in i the award of any negotiated contract except for actions such as letter ii the award of a subcontract at any tier if the contractor and subcontractor have been required to furnish cost or data but see exceptional cases at iii the modification of any sealed bid or negotiated whether or not cost or pricing data were initially required subcontract covered by paragraph of this subsection adjustment amounts shall consider both increases and decreases example a modification resulting from a reduction of and an increase of is a pricing adjustment this requirement does not apply when unrelated separately priced changes for which cost or pricing data would otherwise be required are included for administrative convenience the same unless prohibited because an exception at the head of the contracting activity without power of delegation authorize the contracting officer to obtain cost or pricing data pricing actions below the pertinent threshold in paragraph a this subsection provided the action exceeds the simplified threshold the head of the contracting activity shall justify requirement for cost or pricing data the documentation shall include written finding that cost or pricing data are necessary to whether the price is fair and reasonable and the facts supporting b when cost or pricing data are required the contracting shall require the contractor or prospective contractor to submit to contracting officer and to have any subcontractor or subcontractor submit to the prime contractor or subcontractor tier the following in support of any the cost or pricing a certificate of current cost or pricing data in the specified in certifying that to the best of its knowledge belief the cost or pricing data were accurate complete and as of the date of agreement on price or if applicable another agreed upon between the parties that is as close as practicable to date of agreement on c if cost

closing or cutoff dates should be included as part of the submitted with the proposal and before agreement on price data be updated by the contractor to the latest closing or cutoff dates which the

the contracting officer is responsible for the determination price reasonableness for the prime contract in order to make determination it is required that an analysis be conducted of all relevant facts and data including subcontractor cost or pricing required to be submitted results of the prime or higher analyses of subcontractor proposals the field support if any and historical pricing data the fact that contractor or higher tier subcontractor has an approved system or performs an analysis of subcontractor cost or pricing does not in any way relieve the contracting officer or field support team from the responsibility to analyze the prime submission including the subcontractor cost or pricing data the prime contractor or higher tier subcontractor is responsible conducting appropriate price and cost analysis before awarding subcontractors must submit to the contractor or higher subcontractor cost or pricing data or requests for exception from requirement to submit them the contractor and the higher subcontractor shall i conduct price analyses and when subcontractor is required to submit cost or pricing data or if contractor or higher tier subcontractor is unable to perform adequate price analysis cost analyses for all subcontracts include the results of these analyses as part of their own cost pricing data submission and iii when required in accordance submit the subcontractor cost or pricing data as part their own cost or pricing data b unless the subcontract qualifies for an exception under any contractor required to submit cost or pricing data also obtain cost or pricing data before awarding any subcontract or order expected to exceed the cost or pricing data threshold or any modification involving a price adjustment expected to exceed cost or

such negotiated subcontract prices be accepted as the evidence that these prices are fair and prospective subcontractor cost or pricing a the contracting officer shall require a contractor that is to submit cost or pricing data also to submit to the government cause submission of accurate complete and current cost or data from prospective subcontractors in support of each cost estimate that is or more both more than cost or pricing data threshold and more than percent of the proposed price or considered to be necessary adequately pricing the prime contract these subcontract cost pricing data

pricing data before award of the subcontract in question any from a prospective contractor to be excused from subcontractor data before completion of negotiations of the contract must be supported by an explanation as to why the data analyses cannot be submitted in a timely manner if excusing prospective contractor appears to be appropriate the officer shall provide the chief of the contracting office with prospective explanation the contracting supporting rationale and a discussion of how the subcontract will be determined to be fair and reasonable or what steps will taken to protect the

contractor in accordance with the contracting officer should audit or field pricing support to analyze and evaluate the proposal a subcontractor at any tier notwithstanding availability of data analyses performed by the prime contractor if the contracting believes that such support is necessary to ensure reasonableness of total proposed price this step may be appropriate when for there is a business relationship between the contractor subcontractor not conducive to independence and the contractor is a sole source and the subcontract costs a substantial part of the contract the contractor has been denied access to the the contracting officer determines that because of factors such the size of the proposed subcontract price audit or field support for a subcontract or subcontracts at any tier is critical to fully detailed analysis of the prime contract the contractor or higher tier subcontractor has been cited having significant estimating system deficiencies in the area subcontract pricing especially the failure to perform adequate analyses of proposed subcontract costs or to perform analyses prior to negotiation of the prime contract with government a lower tier subcontractor has been cited as having estimating system b when the contracting officer requests the cognizant aco or to review a cost the request shall include when available a copy of any prepared by the prime contractor or higher tier subcontractor proposal cost or pricing data provided by subcontractor and the results of the prime cost or c when the government performs the subcontract analysis government

differ from traditional evaluation methods traditional reviews local contract audit and contract personnel primarily base their evaluation of forecasted costs on analysis of historical costs and trends in contrast reviews do not assume that a historical costs efficient and economical operation instead these reviews evaluate economy and efficiency of the existing work methods materials facilities operating systems and these reviews are accomplished by a team of contracting contract administration pricing audit and representatives the objective of reviews is to both short and improvements in the economy efficiency in order to reduce the cost of performance of contracts in addition by providing rationale for any and quantifying their impact on cost the government will be able to develop realistic objectives for b there are two types of review see and overhead review see these reviews may be performed together or the scope of a review can range from a examining the entire operation including overhead and selected major subcontractors to a review examining specific portions of a program a program review is used to evaluate significant of direct costs such as material and labor and associated costs usually incurred in the production of major systems when program review is conducted relative to a proposal a separate audit report on the proposal is b a program review should be considered particularly the case of a major system acquisition see part some initial production has already taken the contract will be awarded on a there are future year production requirements for quantities of like the items being acquired have a history of increasing the work is sufficiently defined to permit an effective and major changes are sufficient time is available to plan and conduct the review adequately personnel with the required skills are available or can be for the duration of the c the contracting officer should decide which elements of operation have the greatest potential for cost savings assign the available personnel resources accordingly while particular elements to be analyzed are a function of the contract task elements such as manufacturing pricing and management and organization and subcontract and vendor management normally reviewed in a d in acquisitions for which a program review conducted a separate program review team report in accordance with agency procedures is required field reports are required only to the extent that they contribute to combined team position the contracting officer shall consider findings and recommendations contained in the program review team report when negotiating the contract price completing the negotiation the contracting officer shall provide administrative contracting officer aco a report of any uneconomical or inefficient practices together with a report correction or disposition agreements reached with the contractor contracting officer shall establish a plan to monitor correction of the uneconomical or inefficient e when a program review is planned the officer should state this fact in the acquisition plan see and in the overhead a an overhead review is used to evaluate indirect such as fringe benefits shipping and receiving facilities equipment depreciation plant maintenance and security taxes general and administrative activities it is normally used to and negotiate a forward pricing rate agreement fpra with contractor when an overhead review is conducted separate audit report is b the following factors should be considered when contractor sites for overhead dollar amount of government level of government level of noncompetitive government volume of proposal major system or mergers acquisitions other conditions eg changes in accounting systems or business c the objective of the overhead review is to significant indirect cost elements identify inefficient uneconomical practices and recommend corrective action if it conducted in conjunction with a program review a overhead review report is not required however findings and recommendations of the overhead team or separate overhead review report shall be provided to aco the aco should use this information to form the basis for government position in negotiating a fpra with the contractor the shall establish a plan to monitor the correction of uneconomical or inefficient estimating a the consistent preparation of proposals using an estimating system benefits both the government and the contractor increasing the accuracy and reliability of individual cognizant audit activities when it is appropriate to do so establish and manage regular programs for reviewing estimating systems or methods in order to reduce scope of reviews to be performed on individual proposals the negotiation process and increase the reliability of the results of estimating system reviews shall be documented in b the auditor shall send a copy of the estimating system report and a copy of the official notice of corrective action to each contracting office and contract administration office substantial business with that contractor significant deficiencies corrected by the contractor shall be a

separately priced line items is particularly important when evaluating the relationship of the for first article tests or test items to the price for the units and in evaluating the prices for options in relationship to prices for the basic b an offer is mathematically unbalanced if it is based on which are significantly less than cost for some contract line items significantly overstated in relation to cost for others an offer materially unbalanced if it is mathematically unbalanced and there is a reasonable doubt that the offer would result in lowest overall cost to the government even though it is the evaluated offer the offer is so grossly unbalanced that its acceptance would tantamount to allowing an advance c offers that are materially unbalanced may be d depending on the nature of the acquisition contracting shall use either price analysis or cost analysis techniques or combination of the two techniques to determine if offers materially unbalanced the following are examples of techniques can be used to determine if an offer is unbalanced although examples specifically relate to first article testing they may also used for other procurements where unbalanced offers may be of compare all offers to determine if the offerors have higher prices for the first articles than for the production units comparison should consider whether the government or the will perform the first article for an individual offer compare the relationship of first prices to prices for production items the cost to the offeror first articles may be estimated i by comparing the total offered including the first article to an alternate proposal by same offeror which does not include first article testing or ii if cost data has been submitted by certain elements of cost to determine for instance manufacturing and special tooling and test equipment costs prorated among the first articles and the production units or are applied to the first articles if cost data are not available it be

http://www.inspirenetwork.org/mnre/doc/Final_Report_Cookstove.doc initiative for development and deployment of improved cookstoves recommended action report by institute of technology energy and resources institute new of new and renewable of large percentage of population continues to depend on biomass for their cooking needs the cooking devices used by majority of them have very poor thermal efficiency and serious health impacts due to unclean combustion while past few decades have seen a lot of interest the world over in development of better cookstoves for burning biomass the magnitude of the problem is still a major cause of concern in india a lot of resources went into the national programme on improved cookstoves between and with mixed experiences learning from this programme a need has been felt to start a new initiative on biomass cookstoves with a different approach considering the changes that have taken place in the society technology and the global concerns initiate the process of formulating a new programme a brainstorming session was held by the government in march involving various experts from within india and abroad subsequently in october ministry of new and renewable energy mnre awarded a joint project to iit delhi and teri for six months to make suggestions for the broad contours and the action plan for such a programme in consultation with the stoves community across the country and abroad covering various aspects relevant to biomass cookstoves team of five investigators undertook the task of carrying out wide consultations to formulate the recommendations presented in this report the recommendations have been prepared for five different aspects of cookstoves which the new initiative should address these are i an innovation contest for next generation of cookstoves ii technical aspects including and various issues related to testing and standards iii delivery of improved cookstoves iv fuel processing and supply v community stoves moreover to address the need for a different structure of the new programme npic the project team has also made recommendations for management and implementation strategies for the new initiative recommendations for each of the components outline the activities that need to be carried out under the new initiative it is suggested that these activities be carried out in two phases phase i comprising of the tasks which need to be started immediately so as to prepare the ground for the long term activities to be undertaken in phase ii a brief summary of these recommendations is presented suggest an approach to develop the appropriate technology we also recommend that this prize be central focus on cleaner and efficient combustion is required in order to achieve the health and social gains that are the primary motivator for this the basic technical performance specifications for the cookstove prize should be based on four key parameters carbon monoxide co particulate matter pm efficiency and black carbon additionally have to consider cost safety and as additional given the complexities of the prize design process partnering with the right organization to develop the prize is absolutely critical this organization must have both expertise in developing such prizes and has a global to be carried out in this phase initiating the process of prize design with a the of the entries at the end of the contest cookstoves initiative would need to address the technical needs of the programme which can be categorized under two broad categories a research and development covering fundamental as well as applied research and development of new products b testing and standards addressing the issues related to testing protocols setting up of testing facilities and development of standards for certification specifically the recommendations are summarized as follows i was recognized that there is a need to carry out modifications in the existing bis protocol to take into account the requirements of the new designs in the market it is suggested that interim modifications be made in the protocol on a priority basis after due consultations among the stoves community and also taking into consideration the international developments in stove testing protocols this may be carried out as a short term project coordinated by one institute but with a mandate to involve all the relevant organizations in the process of consultation during the process testing facilities can be set up at one of the institutes for experimental trials of the proposed protocol is also suggested that a more rigorous research oriented approach be adopted to develop protocols which are more suited to the new designs and give greater importance to emissions measurements it is suggested that this work be taken up as a coordinated project by a group of institutes with technical expertise as well as field experience in testing the process for award of such a project should be initiated immediately after the interim protocols are in place is also a strong need for developing standards to enable certification it is recommended to have for various stoves considering the thermal efficiency as well as emissions the performance standards corresponding to the star ratings need to be identified as part of the coordinated project for developing protocols as in recommendation these standards should be linked to health impacts of the cookstove types of testing centres are recommended to be set up as part of the new initiative i in laboratories for cookstoves which can serve as training centres ii certification facilities run by independent organizations iii field testing facilities with grassroot level ngos in the first phase expression of interest eois can be invited for setting up these centres by the time interim protocols are in place the process of setting up a few centres can be set in order to do research on the fundamental scientific principles underlying the design and operation of cookstoves it is recommended that coordinated projects involving research groups across the country should be funded some of these groups could graduate into centres for stoves on the basis of their commitment in the first phase eois followed by open requests for proposals rfps can be invited to form consortia to work on different fundamental aspects as identified in the report it is proposed that all the project proposals be evaluated in a coordinated manner by an advisory body and not viewed as independent proposals as in the routine process of funding by the funding agencies the time this phase starts it is expected that new protocols would have been identified and hence the testing centres initiated in the first phase can get into full operation centres with testing facilities can start regular training of personnel from the commercial testing centres as well as field testing centres the certification centres can carry out the testing in accordance with standards with the services of the field testing centres would be required for evaluating the performance of the improved stoves in the field after a pilot programme first and later as part of any full scale dissemination the formation of consortia the research activities can be funded and would continue into phase ii while giving valuable inputs in the development of new stove designs by the technical is also recognized that there are many stove manufacturers who can develop potentially good stove designs intuitively but they would need technical support to improve upon their designs in order to help stove developers in conducting fundamental analysis of the new designs technical consultancy centres possibly linked to any of the centres could be facilitated to operate in commercial consultancy mode this aspect is particularly important to address some of the specific regional cooking needs of are the recommendations for strategies to be adopted for delivery of stoves for programme as a for an improved cookstove initiative to be sustainable commercialization must be encouraged market development is in turn integral to promoting commercialization a widespread awareness campaign that leverages all forms of media on a massive scale various government channels such as schools and health and social services institutions village demonstrations and advertising among village families and is branded with a recognizable logo and celebrity endorsements would be the best strategy to develop the improved cookstove market a technology is adopted for wide dissemination its assessment and certification must be carried out the certification which is expected to be based on rigorous lab level tests could be the basis of technology selection for pilot level programmes the technology selection for wider dissemination should be based on evaluation of the pilot level programmes the performance of the technology selected must be above a minimum threshold as decided at the appropriate ensure effectiveness in the initial stages of the program it should be carried out in the regions first these targeted areas should be selected based on a variety of strengths including the presence of financial institutions biomass availability managerial and technical readiness determined by past and ongoing successful cookstove dissemination projects and delivery channels maharashtra tamil nadu and karnataka meet these order to reach as many households as effectively and efficiently as possible an extensive network of various types of dealers must be utilized this network could include entrepreneurs and shop owners rather than solely create new delivery networks it may be more efficient to take advantage of existing value chains as well these value chains could be leveraged through collaboration with existing programs such as project shakti and others agricultural retail chains such as hariyali kisaan bazaar and tata kisan sansar and petty the perspective financing an improved cookstove is the greatest challenge there are two options for user subsidies no direct subsidy or a continually decreasing subsidy for the equivalent expenditure on the current annual lpg subsidy cookstoves can be disseminated to every household in rural india under various subsidy schemes households that cannot afford to purchase a stove even after subsidies should be able to receive loans mnre should establish linkages with institutions that can provide these loans such as nationalized banks commercial banks and microfinance institutions additionally as loans often have steep interest rates and many borrowers may not be able to afford the interest interest payments could be partially or fully financial assistance should be linked with the performance of the technology as well as the affordability level of the order to encourage production mnre could offer a advance subsidy or a production tax credit to receive an advance subsidy payment a manufacturer must increase production of cookstoves by a certain percentage under a production tax credit scheme for every certain number of stoves produced a manufacturing company could receive a certain amount of tax credit or choose to take a grant of up to a certain percentage of the manufacturing property value revolving fund could finance other dissemination activities such as awareness raising education of users training of retailers etc the initial seeding for the revolving fund could be provided by nationalized and commercial banks or mnre and various stakeholders which should be members of the partnership could take out loans for dissemination clean development mechanism cdm and carbon credits should be considered for funding the initiative the potential fuelwood and carbon emission savings should qualify cookstove initiative for cdm funding the money earned from selling carbon emissions reduction certificates could be used to fund any combination of the aforementioned activities or financial incentives furthermore carbon credits would encourage private sector participation if manufacturers have the rights to the carbon credits they could use these credits to minimize the retail cost of their stoves is recommended that the dissemination of cookstoves should be carried out first at the pilot level different regions should be selected for pilot programmes experimenting with different delivery models as suggested above based on the outcome of the pilots the strategies for the full scale dissemination can be identified specifically the following activities need to be carried out in the pilot phase or phase of regions suitable for pilot study and conducting baseline surveys for energy consumption with traditional of stove designs for pilot dissemination in selected dissemination strategies for different regions viz direct or indirect subsidies modes of creating user awareness and linkages with banks and mfis establish revolving agency for out awareness campaigns and village of stoves through collaborative supply and evaluation of the pilot strategies for large scale on regular processing and supply are the recommendations for the new initiative to take care of the crucial aspect of fuel cookstoves programme must have a dual thrust on technological improvement in stoves as well as establishment of an assured fuel supply chain the latter is critical to dissemination of devices with rural household has an immense variety of biomass residues transforming them into processed fuels for use with improved cookstoves is crucial to extracting the best performance combustion efficiency and reduced emissions from this initiative pelletizing will be more suitable than briquetting whose size and cost constrains its use in household extensive study on the availability of biomass residues surveying type quantity seasonal variations costs and suitability for pelletization is required as existing data is quite is required for the development of biomass pelletizing machines for production of fuel pellets from available suitable for decentralized operation with a capacity of and with low electricity requirement besides standards need to be evolved for such machinery the research and development of an efficient and improved closed loop decentralized charcoal making unit operating on agricultural residues is field deployment and testing of these fuel processing units in varied regions will allow a detailed assessment of their performance involving the local community in the various operational aspects of the biomass processing unit will integrate and embed this initiative deep into the context of the field energy environment also offering immense possibilities for fostering participation and activities to be carried out in the two phases are enumerated survey of biomass availability present level utilization cost etc for selected regions in the appropriate pelletizing technology available in the country which could be disseminated directly or could be quickly upgraded field testing of the technology and its upgradation with the help of technical expertise if required dissemination of these machines along with the pilot dissemination of stoves as suggested above to use different local design and development of new pelletizing machines and charcoal development and setting up commercially viable fuel processing units and supply operation monitoring and upgradation as per of the the activities and programs emerging from the national biomass cookstoves initiative in the partnership ppp model at all levels will ensure that participants government organizations industry academic and social sector entities can leverage each expertise and ppp needs to be established by an initiating agency comprised of a network of stakeholders and led by a governing council administrative support group would be required to conduct administrative tasks to ensure smooth operation of the partnership and an advisory board would provide guidance to the governing council ceo and project management unit pmu would facilitate project implementation with different areas of expertise would give input to the administrative support group advisory board and project management is suggested that the regional linkages for project implementation be worked out by the project management unit proposed is required from various government ministries industry sources for the awards competition technical testing protocols and facilities and dissemination training electronic print and contact publicity and programmes including fuel and evaluation a central aspect of the initiative needs to be instrumental at every stage from the awards contest and testing to fuel supply and dissemination an independent agency should be identified to carry out which should occur through and especially through field visits and in this project are identified as the government of india ministry of new and renewable energy manufacturers testing agencies retailers financial institutions local ngos academic and research groups and the each playing a distinct role which must be clarified right in the is suggested that the project management group be identified at the beginning of the first phase itself to facilitate the execution of various activities in the first phase of other components enumerated the recommendations made above had the domestic cookstoves at their focus however the importance of community stoves cannot be undermined and as desired by mnre separate recommendations have been prepared for dealing with community stoves it has been recognized that community stoves also require development of new designs testing protocols testing centres standards and fuel supply like the domestic stoves while some aspects can be integrated with the activities to be carried out for domestic stoves it is desirable to have a different approach for pilot studies for various reasons due to institutional usage these stoves can be implemented more easily among at least certain segments of the users the activities recommended for the two phases are as follows i different user segments and regions for pilot dissemination along with strategies for pilot of field working in identified regions for implementation of pilot an agency for monitoring and evaluation of pilot of baseline data with traditional stoves in the identified sites with the help of field monitoring selection of suitable stove designs by implementing installation of stoves by the manufacturers with the help of implementing and evaluation in the field for at least two months by the monitoring suitable protocols and standards for community

and existing biomass chains for processed large number of people too numerous to be all named here individually have contributed to the preparation of this report through participation in various brainstorming sessions stakeholder consultations and other meetings as well as individual discussions and responses to specific requests for information and feedback this report could not have been completed without the time and energy contributed generously by all these individuals moreover the passion that many of them have for the cookstove made the entire experience very enriching for all of us also would like to acknowledge the work of other stalwarts who have spent their lives working for the cookstove some of whom are not amongst us some seem to have slipped into the oblivion due to failing health and some others who continue to contribute silently to the cause without being in the forefront this work indeed builds on the foundations laid by these people would also like to express our sincere thanks to all the project staff who have worked behind the scenes and made it possible for the report to take this shape work was funded by the ministry of new and renewable energy we would like to gratefully acknowledge the financial as well as other support received from the ministry all as an energy has been used by mankind for cooking and space heating since time immemorial while the gaseous fuels like lpg and natural gas have replaced biomass in developed countries and most urban homes in the developing world half of the population and about of rural households in developing nations continue to depend on coal or biomass like wood crop residues cattledung and charcoal for their cooking and heating data from census indicates more than of all households in india rely on traditional energies for their cooking needs figure over of these households are in rural percentage of indian households using various sources of household energy census major part of the household energy consumption is for cooking traditional cookstoves or chulhas which have efficiencies less than and are known to be sources of large quantities of pollutants are used by most rural households in the developing world for cooking the large fuel consumption of these chulhas results in a large amount of time spent in collecting fuel by these households in such households women and children are often exposed to high levels of pollutants for to hours daily over many there are strong evidences to show the relation between exposure to such emissions and acute respiratory infections in children with estimated two to increase in incidence and mortality due to the exposure to these there have been reports on the effect of black carbon released due to unclean combustion in cookstoves on climate change therefore development and dissemination of cookstoves that lead to reducing fuel consumption cooking time and indoor air pollution can effectively contribute to improving the quality of life of rural women and also contribute to climate change mitigation programme on improved cookstoves the energy crisis of the s improvement in biomass burning cookstoves to save fuel was considered as an urgent need and various organizations the world over started working towards the same several developing countries started national level initiatives to enable the development and deployment of improved stoves the need for eliminating smoke from the kitchen also emerged as an additional focus in these india the then department of energy sources dnes which was created in initiated demonstration of improved cookstoves soon after its inception followed by launching of a national programme on improved chulhas npic in the programme objectives were identified to be i fuelwood conservation ii of smoke from kitchens iii reduction of deforestation and environmental degradation iv reduction in the drudgery of tasks performed by women and and their consequent exposure to health hazards and v employment generation in rural in the dnes was upgraded to ministry of energy sources mnes and continued to manage this programme in the ministry was renamed as ministry for new and renewable resources npic was implemented through involvement of various state nodal agencies in almost all the states and union territories technical and training support to the programme was provided by technical support units tbsus set up under the npic at different universities iits and other institutions of the country more than fixed and portable models of improved chulhas with and without chimney and suitable for different fuels cooking habits and local requirements and using different materials of construction were developed and taken up for installation under some of the models approved by mnes are listed in appendix improved chulhas were installed for family community and industrial applications with the help of state level nodal departments and agencies through their district and block level cells at the village level organizations ngos and workers sew played an important role in the dissemination of improved cookstoves annual targets decided at the national level and then forwarded for implementation at the state level were the main driving force for the programme supported heavily by subsidy the cost of chulhas varied in the range of indian rs of which was met by a direct cash subsidy given under the total of million improved chulhas were installed by under this programme with varying degree of success in different regions in the country some models had better acceptability than others in specific regions certain regions showed greater enthusiasm on the part of the users to adopt new designs for a variety of reasons the programme brought a mixed bag of the programme was formally declared closed in for a new though the npic was formally closed the need for improved cookstoves to reach nearly million rural and households of india has persisted the awareness about adverse health impacts due to unclean combustion of biomass has increased with a need to take effective steps to improve indoor air quality in rural households by providing cleaner cooking options with increasing concerns about climate change and outdoor air quality as well it is no more considered sufficient to remove the smoke from the kitchen using a chimney there is a widely felt need for providing biomass burning cookstoves with cleaner combustion at very low level of emissions and at affordable price the meantime several innovative designs have reached the market with a promise to provide much cleaner combustion and high thermal however the cost of these stoves is quite high which is limiting the clientele in the open market moreover some of them use processed fuel which raises additional requirement of smooth supply of such fuel on one hand it is recognized that clean combustion techniques with sustainable biomass harvesting practices can provide one of the greenest energy technologies on the other it is clear that there is a need for high scientific and technical inputs to develop cheaper and clean burning stoves with long life many other issues related to dissemination fuel supply monitoring and evaluation also need to be addressed with management inputs for effective business plans and sound government policies what started as a purely engineering approach to improved stoves is now being looked upon as a combination of fundamental science engineering production and marketing that is common to most successful product development cycles view of the above mnre has been exploring the possibilities for launch of a new programme on improved biomass cookstoves that aims to facilitate the development of the next generation of biomass stoves for household and community cooking and their widespread deployment with multiple benefits of health mitigation of climate change and energy conservation to consult the community of people working on stoves on this issue mnre organised a brain storming session in march there was an overwhelming support for a new initiative subsequently the initiative was formally launched by the honourable minister for new and renewable energy dr farooq abdullah on december the text of the press release on the occasion of the launch is given in appendix was also recognized by the ministry that such an initiative needs thorough planning which includes building on and learning from efforts made in this area in the past understanding the existing position and assessing the future possibilities identifying the infrastructure and manpower available and preparing proper strategies and a plan of action to help in defining the contours of this programme a project was awarded to iit delhi aimed at carrying out the preparatory activities along with teri delhi and in consultation with other members of the stoves community the details of this project and methodology followed in the same are summarised in the next of this report is an outcome of the months project given by mnre to iit delhi the report consists of three chapters the next chapter gives the summary of the project proposal and the methodology followed to come up with the recommendations which are given in chapter this chapter gives the recommendations for different components covering various aspects of a cookstoves programme including proposal for time scheduling of the various tasks each chapter is supported by material given in appendices the present the government has already launched the new initiative the execution of the same requires working out the actual constituents of this initiative and identifying the strategies for effective implementation of the same it is also desirable that such an action plan is prepared with a very wide consultation of the stoves community mnre awarded a project to iit delhi along with teri delhi to carry out the preparatory activities including literature review and wide consultations leading to an action plan for the initiative the original duration of the project was six months from october to march and was later extended till may was recognized at the outset that any such activity must address the following aspects of a stoves and development of new designs any chulha programme can be successful only if it first targets the development of sound technology suitable for the clientele it proposes to cater to in the current scenario despite several decades of work on development of improved chulhas the scientific knowledge base on design of high performance chulhas is very limited thus the initial brain storming brought out the fact that the new initiative for improved chulhas has to have a approach attract new ideas and creative designs by way of having public contests for improved chulhas support targeted activities which lead to scientific methodologies for design and testing of high performance chulhas protocols and performance standards even though there is performance protocols certified by bis at the international level these protocols are still evolving in view of the new designs of stoves moreover there is a need for setting standards for performance which have to link to any possible government support to a models the methodologies adopted for dissemination of stoves plays a very crucial role in the acceptance of the processing and supply in view of the new stoves using processed fuel this area has gained a lot of significance and calls for an was also decided that the issues related to community stoves may be addressed separately the objectives were then further reorganised to separate the contest from the other technical aspects viz testing and broadly the project was aimed at the of various status reports corresponding to the components identified above view of the status reports preparation of recommendations for implementation covering all aspects of the programme a national workshop for getting feedback from the stoves community on the recommendations and finalize the objectives spelt out in the project proposal are as objective the broad objective is to prepare a firm plan of action for the launch of the new initiative on promotion of improved biomass for a global cookstove contest to leverage international technical talent to develop the of biomass cookstove technologies coordinated by prof ambuj sagar iit of present state of and technical capabilities relevant to cook stoves and preliminary identification of research and infrastructure development activities for the broadening and strengthening of and other technical capacity in the country to engage in research on various aspects of cookstoves including combustion materials emissions testing monitoring standards and certification of cookstoves coordinated by dr sangeeta kohli iit of existing delivery models of cookstove dissemination in india so that the deployment strategy for the proposed national programme incorporates best possible technologies and ground realities coordinated by mr ibrahim hafeezur rehman teri new of biomass processing technologies and identification of existing biomass supply chains for processed fuel coordinated by mr sunil dhingra teri new of status and suggestions for future strategy and plan of action for community larger sized cookstoves outsourced to feedback business consulting services pvt of a joint national workshop in april there were six work elements of which the first five were research work elements iit delhi was coordinating the overall project and was responsible for four work elements corresponding to objectives and teri was responsible for two work elements corresponding to objectives and the fifth research work element on community cookstoves involved field survey with expert guidance supervision and consultancy this work was outsourced to feedback business consulting services pvt ltd the objective of the survey was to determine the kind of cookstoves and used in various regions of the country for meals in government run schools this was to help ascertain the need for intervention in these schools and the impact that introduction of better performance community stoves can have in terms of fuel saving and reduction in emissions methodology section briefly outlines the methodology followed to arrive at the recommendations given in this the project to the formulation of the project mnre had constituted a core group to identify the immediate action plan subsequent to the session initially it consisted of only members from delhi for ease of consultation this group formulated the project being executed currently and hence finally constituted the project team subsequently the core group was expanded by mnre to include other groups intensively engaged in activities and some manufacturers of stoves and machines appendix b gives the list of core group members as on march project was proposed with project investigator pi and two other from iit delhi and two from teri while the pi was responsible for the overall coordination of the project the work pertaining to each of the objectives was coordinated by one as given in figure each as coordinator of a component identified team research staff and consultants were hired while many others were consulted by the coordinator for discussions regarding their component besides extensive literature survey was carried out the main findings of which are briefly presented along with recommendations more details being given in appendices and all met on regular basis both at iit delhi as well as teri to discuss the common issues and review the progress of work besides several meetings were held with the advisor mnre and the secretary mnre to seek their advice and

awarded the feedback business consulting services pvt ltd svati the above list gives the working group including the advisors who gave substantial inputs during the course of the project the recommendations in chapter are a result of inputs from a much larger community of people starting with those who participated in the session in march immediately after this session organised by mnre the advisor biomass mnre sought suggestions and comments from all the participants on various issues related to cookstoves many of them spent time in putting down their comments which have been compiled and included in appendix these comments gave a very useful starting point to the project the project was initiated in october the consultative group was expanded to include many others who were not able to make it to the session but have been working passionately in the area and some of those who would like to be a part of this activity in future thus a large number of people have been giving their inputs from time to time in formal as well as informal meetings during the course of this project some of the project team members also visited the sites of some manufacturers which resulted in valuable inputs to this first draft of recommendations was circulated to the stoves community followed by a consultative meeting held on march the feedback obtained was incorporated in the final recommendations which were presented in the national workshop held at iit delhi on may the present report has taken into consideration the comments received during the national workshop as well thus the present report is an outcome of an open consultative approach with a large number of contributors appendix b gives the list of various organizations and individuals who have been a part of this network work on community mnre has wanted to start some activities for community biomass stoves which can take off more quickly than the programme for the domestic biomass stoves the government schools serving meals to children were considered as strong candidates for adopting improved community stoves if they were already using biomass for cooking the meals for this purpose a survey was planned for some selected regions to be conducted by an organisation with experience in conducting such surveys three candidate organisations were considered through the proper procedures of iit delhi for awarding contracts finally considering various aspects feedback consulting bangalore were awarded the iit team interacted with the team of feedback business consulting services pvt ltd at the initial stage of designing the questionnaire ms svati bhogle tide provided extensive guidance on the same the progress of the survey was reviewed with interim reports provided by the consultant the terms of reference of the work carried out by them is given in appendix b and the final report submitted by them is given in appendix from this survey mnre also initiated a discussion session on january in iit delhi on community stoves by inviting various manufacturers of the stoves in a meeting of the core group on biomass stoves iit delhi had also procured the stoves from these manufacturers which were demonstrated in the premises of iit delhi appendix b includes the list of manufacturers of community stoves who participated in that meeting the recommendations for work to be carried out under the new initiative on each of the components identified above are presented in the next the national national workshop was organized at iit delhi on may to present the recommendations prepared by the project team while throughout the duration of the project extensive consultations were held by each group with a large of experts and stakeholders the workshop gave the opportunity to all the participants to have an integrated view of the recommendations and give their feedback in that light the workshop thus served as a platform for ratification of the recommendations by the stoves community most of the comments received during the workshop have been incorporated in the final report recommendations for the new biomass stoves chapter focuses on the recommendations which have resulted from the last few months of work involving review of the literature extensive discussions the recommendations have been provided in two parts part a spells out the constituents of the prospective programme while part b identifies the implementation and management strategies for the programme including a proposed schedule for various activities required to initiate the programme the work was divided into five components addressing five different aspects of a prospective cookstoves programme the recommendations prepared by each of the groups have been presented in part a in separate sections viz i innovation prize ii technical aspects iii delivery models iv fuel preparation and supply and v issues in community cookstoves these recommendations first focus on identification of the tasks which must be carried out under each of these components to constitute a national programme some of these tasks may involve making choices wherever relevant the range of options has been given for these choices with analysis of the pros and cons of each of these choices these are followed by suggestions on how the choices can be made by adopting a widely acceptable b focusses on suggestions on the design of the entire programme so as to be able to carry out the tasks enumerated in part a the organizational structure that can facilitate effective implementation of the programme has been suggested and specific recommendations have been made on monitoring and evaluation of the programme as a whole with a scope to take quick corrective actions as and when necessary this part is common to all components of the programme besides the sequencing of various activities under the programme has been suggested particularly in the first two years of the brief justifications have been provided for all the recommendations in this chapter selected background material forming the foundation of these recommendations has been given in the appendices at the end of the report may be pertinent to reiterate that the indian government has launched this programme the primary aim of enhancing the availability of clean and efficient energy for the energy deficient and poorer sections of our moreover to quote the document released during the formal launch of the initiative programme is conceived not as a handout to poorer households but rather as an economically sustainable business it is suggested that the recommendations in the subsequent sections be seen in this light a constituents of the proposed innovation primary motivation for the cleaner cookstoves initiative is reduction in health impacts from indoor air pollution although with other important such as improved efficiency of resource use reduction in time and effort to collect biomass with concomitant social benefits and climate therefore we need to develop the cleanest possible coosktoves in fact our broad aspiration as spelled out in the improved cookstove initiative press release should be to deliver as clean a cooking experience as other common options such as lpg although cookstoves are a significant improvement on designs available even a decade ago there is scope for further improvement and this will be needed if we are to meet the health and other imperatives noted at the launch of the requires us to develop the of cookstoves that are as efficient and clean as possible and to do this as soon as possible since every year lost means additional health burdens but motivating the development of these cookstoves is itself a difficult challenge and this section proposes and discusses a new approach towards a global innovation prize traditionally new technologies are developed through funding in that area or by creating markets that stimulate technical activities which lead to the desired goal funding is generally constrained in that it can fund only a few groups and these need not be the ones with the greatest expertise since these latter groups especially industrial laboratories may not be suitably motivated to work on this topic by necessarily limited funds which means that the technology development process takes time and the outcome remains uncertain the other model of creating a market also has limited relevance in the stoves context given the low purchasing power of the group especially the poorest of the poor who would be the biggest beneficiaries of a cleaner cookstoves program and also the difficulty in delivering a standardized product that meets needs of a range of customers unlike a shampoo recent years increasing attention has been paid to the idea of as an efficient and effective way to induce the development of technology in neglected areas by motivating a large number of to focus on a specific specifically this refers to grand to stimulate or technology the is probably the most prominent current examples the million ansari x for the first organization to launch a reusable manned spacecraft into a suborbital altitude of at least kilometers twice within two weeks was won in by burt rutan with his spaceshipone another example is the golden carrot awards sponsored by the us environmental protection agency in partnership with companies utilities and environmental groups where the development of the refrigerator was the first in the arena of cookstoves chinese have set an example by organizing a nationwide contest see box this has demonstrated the potential of using this approach to promote innovation in the development of inducement prizes should be viewed as a potential complement to and not a substitute for traditional funding for research and innovation inducement prizes do offer several advantages market or institutional failures in developing technologies for specific a broader spectrum of ideas and participants by reducing the barriers to a goal to be achieved without having to decide which is the best way to meet that much of the risk to the participants since the award of the prize is contingent of the contest parameters being met capacity of prizes to educate inspire and even mobilize the additional resources from firms and other fact a panel at the us national research council has recommended that the us national science foundation experiment with prizes as a way to promote others have proposed the use of prizes to induce the innovation of or the development of agricultural innovations for the third in order to be successful though it is important to design the contest carefully both in terms of defining the parameters of participation and the goal to be achieved furthermore if the ultimate aim is to commercialize the technology then some thought must also be given to the buyer commitment or a market creating strategy we suggest an approach to develop the appropriate technology furthermore given the complexity of burning biomass cleanly in cookstoves and delivering the resulting heat to the cooking vessels we want as many groups worldwide as possible to work on this problem not only experts in combustion but also materials and design therefore we suggest a global innovation prize that leverages innovation talent worldwide to tackle this important we note that this would not preclude the participation of indian groups if anything were an indian group to win a global prize of this kind it would be a great feather in their the chinese biomass stove innovation shell foundation shell china the china association of rural energy industry carei and the center for entrepreneurship in international health and development ceihd together began to organize a household energy prize competition the partnership sponsored a competition the biomass stove innovation awards to identify rank and recognize the most innovative designs in cleaner burning and more efficient biomass cooking stoves in reasoning was that a competition would focus attention on technological innovation for biomass stoves and help identify the manufacturers best able to produce and distribute stoves that respond to the needs of rural households in china and perhaps in other developing countries as well furthermore stove competitions had previously been a successful feature of nisp suggesting that a prize scheme was a viable framework for achieving wider improved stove dissemination in china objectives to test the ability of new stove technologies to deliver a clean convenient and reliable cooking to evaluate the robustness of the enterprises to raise the profile of stoves by publicizing their ability to meet rigorous test standards to assess the usefulness of the stoves in meeting needs in other countries and to review the use of an innovation prize as a tool for developing and disseminating appropriate competition brought forward several different design approaches from two dozen entrants out of which devices from ten manufacturers were chosen for further assessment each had an established market presence and in a series of laboratory tests designed for the competition the designs were found to have significantly better fuel efficiency and lower emissions of pollutants than traditional chinese biomass stoves identified winners had fuel efficiencies in the standard chinese water boiling test ranging from and ratios of about see appendix carbon monoxide and particle emissions were respectively and gram per kilogram of fuel more than an order of magnitude below traditional stoves these stoves were all stoves in which combustion occurs in two stages with the best performing using an electric blower to stabilize combustion sales of these stoves showed significant growth in the years following the competition see appendix c although by less than total units had been key lessons include a need to pay particular attention to the metrics for evaluation of entries where the need is for parsimony in including relevant characteristics and simplicity in translating these into indicators and the protocols for evaluation that must take local consideration into the possibility of some rewards early in the project cycle and also to the whole participating cohort instead of a prize awarded to one winner at the end of the competition also may be worth drawn from national household stove innovation prize to stimulate market activity in china charron d chen x dunaway j hao f willson b deng k smith kr draft paper under preparation please do not cite or quote without focus on cleaner and efficient combustion while there have been many improvements in cookstoves technology in the past few years we believe that a central focus on cleaner and efficient combustion is required in order to achieve the health and social gains that are the primary motivators for this of the work on cookstove development focuses on the design of the overall product the stove with the design of the basic technology the combustion chamber as part of that process but the expertise needed for the design of a clean and efficient combustion chamber is quite different from the expertise and the process for the design of the stove the former requires a deep understanding of complex scientific process of biomass burning therefore it requires the involvement of combustion and fluid dynamics experts and will rely on tools such as computational fluid dynamics and combustion modeling this is not to say that the design of a combustion chamber does not require industrial design principles indeed it does since the cost and the durability of the chamber will depend on materials choices for example the design of the chamber also requires an understanding of user needs such as power ie energy per unit time requirements therefore we need to ensure that experts with these technical skills are drawn into the process are two possible approaches here one the prize could be for cookstoves which deliver some specified high thermal efficiency and low emissions which can include an additional criterion of amenability for mass scale production another approach could focus the prize on a clean combustion chamber which then could form the basis of different stove designs such modularization is a standard approach in industrial production processes for example car companies routinely develop engines that then form the basis of multiple car designs which aim to satisfy multiple consumer we believe that if we truly are to deploy the tens of millions of cookstoves that are needed to meet the goals of this initiative such approaches will need to be given full consideration it also highlights the need for a multidisciplinary the prize should focus on development of combustion and possibly a biomass processing technology if the wide range in the economic status of biomass users in the country in fact the stoves on the market cost from less than rs to more than rs we believe that we could consider the development of two units a unit that is usable in stoves that are targeted towards the poorest of the poor and then a slightly unit that will be used in stoves that are targeted towards the group with a higher purchasing power need to consider and define multiple criteria a successful design will need to meet the health climate and other imperatives that motivate a new program at the same time other considerations such as safety cost and robusteness will determine their deployability in actual conditions therefore we have to take into account technical performance considerations as well as safety cost and robustness specifications the point of view of health impacts the two key pollutants would be co and particulate matter pm which require clean combustion social and local environmental and resource conservation considerations necessitate a focus on efficiency which also helps reduce pollution minimizing the climate impacts of the cookstoves will also require reduction of black carbon therefore we propose a focus on these four key characteristics for the basic performance begin with the assumption that we want to come as close to lpg performance as possible currently available technologies fan gasifier which is also the most expensive technology are at best about times lpg on co almost times lpg on pm and almost times that of lpg on bc and cheaper technologies fare much poorer all on a basis as seen in table we propose that the pollutant emission benchmark for the combustion unit that can deliver higher performance be times that of lpg for co pm and pollutant emission benchmark for the unit where we will have to compromise on performance somewhat due to an unavoidable could be times that of lpg for co pm and bc given that the unit is targeted towards the poorest sections of society this will need to be based on the unprocessed biomass as fuel with some representative mix to be defined for the test specifications the cost attribute depends both on the feedback from existing programs as well as the general possibilities afforded by delivery terms of costs as mentioned earlier stove models are available or likely to be available in the near future in prices ranging from less than rs to over rs we assume that a cookstove based on the combustion unit could cost between rs if we assume that the combustion unit accounts for of the cookstove cost it pegs the cost benchmark for the combustion chamber at rs assume that a cookstove based on the technology could cost between rs this represents the upper range of the cost that would allow deployment for the poorest of the poor if we assume that the combustion unit will account for about of the cost of the stove it pegs the cost benchmark at rs might also want to include a component for annual running costs fuel and order to set some robustness and durability criteria we recommend that the combustion unit be designed to last for at least cycles with a performance degradation of less than per might also want to set a benchmark for sensitivity to variation in fuel parameters eg moisture should be noted that the parameters and numbers suggested for performance specifications are first estimates and therefore taken as representative of what is being envisaged to take the prize concept forward the performance parameters will need to be discussed and the relevant specifications worked out in detail with clear justifications for the choice of those stove performance from laboratory emission factors draft et al low and high burn et al in case of agricultural residue emission factors mustard stalk combustion in traditional mud stove has been used rice straw has not been chosen because it is mostly used to feed cattle and only about of total generated waste is used as fuel ravindranath and hall et al mustard tur cotton soybean jute stalks et al jetter and kariher et al single values are maccarty measured zero values for ch and from philips fan gasifier assumed efficiency for natural draft as lower focus on multiple elements of prize design a successful contest requires paying attention to multiple elements goal setting prize strategy ensuring impact and activities to ensure successful delivery figure in this venture will depend on appropriate prize design as well as subsequent delivery the prize design process itself is quite complicated involving analyzing and translating the kind of considerations listed in into specific criteria it also involves reaching out to motivating participants setting clear rules for participation and winning the rights of participants the magnitude and nature of the prize as well as the staging and stages of prize development and delivery source additional key issues that will need to be attention or hybrid the notion of the prize is the past the winner where the is the benchmark that has been while this is a standard model and relatively simple to operationalize we might also want to consider a hybrid model where we give a prize to the best design above the benchmark but then also keep in consideration for the next stage ie the conversion of the combustion unit to cookstove a select number of models that also exceed the benchmark even if they win the market commitment amc it may also be desirable to consider an amc as a complement to the prize as a way of stimulating cookstove development from the combustion units this in some sense then becomes akin to a process where the first stage the prize yields combustion units and the second stage the amc leads to the development of cookstoves where again we can specify certain performance and cost partnering with the right organization given points and above we believe that it is imperative to partner with the right kind of organization that has both expertise in developing such prizes and has a global recommendations for technical work in work for development of cookstoves as well as their testing forms the backbone of any programme on improved cookstoves a lot of work went into these two aspects under the npic being a first programme of its kind it was indeed noteworthy that npic involved a large number of scientists social scientists field workers across the entire country for a common cause the main concern at that time was to save fuelwood and do something immediate to make the kitchen hence the approach adopted focused more on the thermal efficiency which was increased by addressing the heat transfer issues supply of adequate air was ensured through pressure drop calculations and the smoke was gotten rid of by the use of a chimney in some designs the improved stoves were in certain regions primarily because of substantial fuel and time saving as compared to traditional stoves and kitchens in case of stoves having chimneys time the perceptions about improved stoves have changed particularly with new technologies in the market which are giving a greater emphasis on cleaner combustion in the device apart from having a good thermal efficiency moreover the consciousness over severe health impacts associated with exposure to pollutants from the cookstoves has increased in the past few years consequently there is a need to have a fresh look at the process of designing stoves using more fundamental knowledge of science in view of the recent developments there is also a need to review the testing protocols the recommendations in this section focus attention on all that scientists and engineers need to do towards development of better and more acceptable stoves in accordance with certain standards the past three decades a large body of literature has been created by researchers the world over which has brought the stoves into the arena of scientific investigation recommendations on technical aspects of cookstoves presented in the present section are divided into three major parts i testing and standards ii development of stove designs iii fundamental work related to materials and various phenomena it is envisaged that different groups will contribute to these three aspects with some overlap the effort here has been to identify specific research and development projects which can be taken up by various groups already working on stoves or interested in taking up the task from now on it is also expected that these projects shall be evaluated and finally carried out in a coordinated mode rather than as individual projects isolated from others the recommendations given below should be seen in this testing and is a very important part of any cookstoves programme in view of the development of several new designs in the recent past the need for review of testing protocols and setting up new facilities has acquired great importance the activities related to testing required to be carried out under the new initiative can be classified under five categories i review of testing protocols their standardization and identification of equipment which should be part of the testing facilities of various kinds ii developing performance standards for certification iii setting up the testing facilities of various kinds iv training of the personnel for testing in the lab and the field v commissioning of the certification centres each of these is discussed in greater detail review of testing protocols of cookstoves must cover three major components i thermal performance ii emissions and iii safety durability and maintainability performance was the first to get the attention of the international cookstoves community several decades ago resulting in the development of the boiling wbt as a simplified simulation of a cooking process the first version of wbt was prepared in a meeting convened by vita volunteers in technical assistance in subsequently wbt was revised and supplemented by two more tests another lab test the controlled cooking test cct and a field test the kitchen performance test kpt vita since then the wbt and the performance parameters it yields have been under close study and various researchers have suggested modifications in the same in aprovecho research centre along with uc berkeley with assistance from shell foundation revised the vita protocols with changes in wbt as well as cct and kpt this version is referred to as wbt since the ethos engineers in technical and humanitarian opportunities of service and pcia partnership for clean indoor air networks have been working towards further revision of these protocols after a wide public consultation this new version of wbt currently designated as is due to be finalized soon this version includes measurement of emissions of different pollutants from the cookstove simultaneously with thermal efficiency the protocol also has the flexibility of being applied to the new types of the stoves eg gasifier stoves or other stoves using prepared fuel however in such cases two stoves of different kind cannot be compared using the results of these tests two of the stove manufacturers viz envirofit and philips have come together to modify the available protocols to suit the requirements of their designs this protocol is designated as stove manufacturers emissions and performance test this protocol focuses on reducing the variability of the test results due to various factors the protocol needs further debate before its wider acceptance bureau of indian standards bis adopted a modified version of the original as its own standard the bis testing protocol also included measurement of as a separate test this test is meant for only metallic stoves and tests the stove only at high power thus not evaluating the ratio of the stove which is a very important parameter for the user there has already been a move by bis to revise these standards a comparison between four different protocols viz eptp and bis has been provided in appendix even a preliminary review given above shows that there is still no agreement over these protocols despite a wide debate there seem to be practical difficulties in adhering to some aspects of these protocols it is also being argued that these tests are not suitable for stoves including some of the gasifier stoves the methodology used to determine the ratio is also questioned by some researchers in addition many researchers are pointing out that the lab tests do not represent the actual cooking practices well enough in a recent paper by johnson et al a new approach is being suggested wherein burn cycles are derived from temporal data of emissions obtained from the field using the traditional stove they suggest that the lab tests for the improved stove be designed based on these burn cycles so as to obtain a much better correspondence between the lab test results and field performance of the improved stove this is an important aspect as it is well understood that wbt does not truly represent the performance of the stove under the real conditions where cooking practices vary vastly from what wbt simulates there are also different opinions on whether a stove performance should be characterized by a single number for efficiency and similarly for different emissions at a given power or should a set of performance characteristics of the stove be provided for efficiency and emissions as a function of the power input or the burn view of the above the need for further work to have universally acceptable protocols arises strongly it is clear that it will require time to carry out this task in the indian context on the other hand in india an urgent need is felt to test some of the new designs according to widely acceptable protocols particularly where bis protocol is not strictly applicable and needs modification this is required for a sound comparison between the new designs and to take the next step towards dissemination of the available designs it is thus recommended that india should take immediate steps towards revising its protocols for the long term and in the meantime the bis protocol can be modified suitably to widen its applicability to new stove designs can help in providing the guidelines for interim modification in the bis of protocols in project review and revision of protocols as well as standards it is recommended that this task must be coordinated by an organization in project mode in association with bis such a project must involve an international consortium including those adept at testing cookstoves in the lab and in the field as well as scientists involved in design and analysis of stoves results of extensive testing of different types of stoves by the stove testers using different protocols need to be analysed carefully by this consortium both from practical testing point of view and fundamental scientific point of view this must be coupled with sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of variability in any aspect of a protocol on the outcome of the tests the extent to which the protocol can represent the real cooking practices also needs to be ascertained these should then result in the recommendations for the revised version of the protocols and standards which can be further subjected to wider public debate involving a larger community working on stoves before being accepted as the revised standards by bis and perhaps also at international levels the final outcome of this project should be a revised version of standards for testing of different types of stoves for thermal efficiency as well as specific emissions as part of the protocols the standard equipment to be used must also be specified with their technical specifications that can help in purchase of the right equipment testing of the new stove designs in the meantime it is recommended that the bis standard be modified suitably as an interim measure after a quick consultation with the stoves community in the country this work should also be coordinated by an organization as part of a project of short duration the group must have a close look at the various recent protocols available at the international level the requirements of the new stove designs to recommend the interim modifications in the bis protocol the latest versions of cct and kpt being used by aprovecho may also be adopted development of performance standards standard testing protocols are essential to test stoves so as to get repeatable performance parameters for a given product for any mature technology it is important to have performance standards for certification it is recommended that these standards be developed as part of the exercise of long term review of testing protocols these standards must cover thermal efficiency emission factors for co pm total and and bc is also suggested that the standards be specified in such a manner that the products can be rated like the star rating of various energy equipments by the bee this would allow a range of products to get certified and would encourage the manufacturers of a certain design with a lower rating to aspire for a higher rating through improvement in their product it is also suggested that the range of performance permissible under a given must be linked to the expected health impacts of a stove having certain power vs efficiency characteristics and power vs emission characteristics it may be essential to emphasize that the estimates of health impacts of a technology with given characteristics must be based on actual measurements in the field with use of sound statistical tools to make the required setting up of testing facilities exercise of revising protocols has to be taken up in tandem with the activity of setting up testing facilities there is a case for setting up three kinds of centres with testing is envisaged that under the new initiative several groups in the country would be involved in fundamental as well as applied research related to cookstoves out of these some groups may have more long term commitment to the cause of cookstove development and may have a larger number of people interested in this activity the parent institutes of such groups may be designated as centres for the facilities developed at these centres as part of the cookstoves programme must be available to other groups as well as and when required it is expected that the groups doing fundamental research on combustion relevant to cookstoves leading to new designs of stoves would need a testing facility particularly for emission measurements for combustion research as well as for testing their own designs for emissions as well as thermal performance groups could also take up the task of evolving testing standards for which such a facility would be essential or else they could collaborate with others working on testing protocols sharing the testing facilities with them these groups with state of the art equipment for testing could also carry out the training of personnel for certification centres as well as field testing centres however these groups should not be given the task of certification second type of testing facility is required for certification of any product such a facility should be independent of the organizations involved in product development as well as the funding agencies these should be paid facilities maintained by private public sector enterprises or government agencies other than those funding the cookstoves programmes any organization developing a new product must get the performance parameters of their product measured at these certification centres performance measurements by only these certification centres should be considered for the purpose of aid or approval of the product by the government agencies it may be made mandatory for stove manufacturers to get the certification of their products done periodically say once in six months for samples from different batches of the type of testing facility required is the one with field testing equipment and with trained manpower for carrying out the same in the field this would be required for evaluation of the success in the field such a facility again should be independent of agencies developing cookstoves and those funding cookstoves programmes these facilities could be provided in the grassroots level ngos who are involved in dissemination of different products but are not developing cookstoves themselves to ensure proper use of these facilities by trained personnel the field testing centres managed by the ngos could be affiliated to one of the centres the field testing centres would come into picture as part of the monitoring and evaluation of any dissemination programme it is expected that first dissemination would be carried out at pilot scale the evaluation of which would be carried out by the field testing centres subsequently based on the feedback from the field testing centres larger dissemination programmes would be taken up which would again be evaluated by these field testing centres it is proposed that several such centres should be setup depending upon the requirement only personnel trained and certified for field testing should be allowed to carry out the field parameters to be tested each of the above facilities the equipment required may vary as discussed the first facility it will be desirable to have all the state of the art equipment to carry out the measurement of the following efficiency as a function of power input or the fuel burning ratio particulates pmtotal and hc oc and bc as a function of fuel burning and safety the certification facility as well it will be desirable to have capability to measure all the above if the facility is setup in stages over time the equipment for analysis of particulate sizes can be obtained at a later third type of centres should have facility to carry out the controlled cooking test cct in their laboratory and portable equipment for kitchen performance test kpt and emissions of co and particulate matter and pm in the actual kitchens of centres of each activity in stoves can be taken up by any group interested in the area centres discussed above are expected to be a few in number to start with any other group widening their activity in the area of cookstoves may qualify to get the status of an centre in due course in this regard they would be different from the technical backup units of the start with there is a case for only two cookstoves certification centres in the country the need for two centres arises for comparison of the tests to ensure that the test results are obtained with standard protocols and are should be multiple centres for field testing as the programme for delivery of new cookstoves picks up more and more such centres can be in different regions of the of setting up the such centre should be only through open requests for proposals these proposals should be evaluated by an advisory body rather than independent experts the proposals should be looked at in tandem rather than as independent the testing centres must be setup as soon as possible and the work to review or revise the testing protocols may take time this group recommends an interim revision of bis protocols for testing till the long term revision is carried out in project mode in association with bis as recommended above training of personnel for mentioned earlier the centres in the country can also serve as training centres for personnel designated to carry out the task of testing either in certification centres or in field testing centres it is recommended that in both these testing centres certification and field testing the personnel must have at least a high school education with a good proficiency in at least the local language in certification centres a reasonable proficiency in english is desirable so as to be able to refer to the international literature on testing as and when required a one week training programme is a must to understand the background of testing of cookstoves as also to learn the use of various equipments and following the protocols scrupulously variability in handling different kinds of stoves must be an important component of the training programmes the field testing training programme may be longer say days of contact spanned over a month or two to include the controlled cooking test in the lab and field training in carrying out the kitchen performance from the above a culture of testing has to be promoted at various levels this can be done by taking up student projects related to testing in educational institutes and generating awareness among users for the importance of testing and certification the local manufacturers can also be encouraged to have their product tested and certified for their commissioning of centres the certification centres to start functioning as a regular testing centre it is important that first a few stoves must be tested at all these centres and also at least at one centre the test results from all these centres must be compared and any significant discrepancy must be analysed so as to rectify any problem in the testing procedure or the equipment only after consistent results are obtained for at least different stoves from all the centres should the certification centres be allowed to operate for their routine field testing centre can also be commissioned for the purpose after the results of the controlled cooking tests carried out by them in the lab as well as the kitchen performance tests in the field on a pilot scale ie for households are analysed and found to be consistent with each other and with the scientific understanding of the research and focus is to carry out fundamental or applied research which can add to the body of knowledge relevant to stove design and performance the outcome of this work could be either creation of public domain literature on fundamental issues which can be used by anybody or it could be used directly by the centres for design and development of better already discussed it is recommended that centres be created in different parts of the country where fundamental would lead to new stove designs with state of the art facilities for testing the stoves in the developing the literature in view recommendations for the kind of projects which should be carried out in future to add to the fundamental knowledge base are listed research being proposed here also covers the health and social science aspects the need for which has been spelt out at the end of this may be reiterated that the research and developmental work proposed here is recommended to be carried out in a coordinated mode with consortia working on different aspects this is in contrast to the usual mode of funding research proposals by various funding agencies of receiving individual proposals reviewed by different experts in the present context a coordinated approach will help in filling the missing links in the bigger picture essential to make a major headway in this are an extremely important part of any stove the high temperature environment to which the combustion chamber is exposed is highly corrosive and hence can severely affect the life of the combustion chamber lining the desirable features of material for stove in high temperature to transport the finished product without damage for portable thermophysical properties ie should have low density low specific heat and low conductivity to reduce transient as well as steady state energy losses from the combustion for stoves can be divided into two broad categories metals and ceramics the literature on materials shows that the metals with long life in combustion environments are generally very costly and not available locally they need special treatment before they can be used for the manufacture of the product however the metal stoves are easier to manufacture and transport are inorganic materials eg silica magnesia alumina traditionally bricks with mud plastering are used in stoves made in situ clay has also been used for stove construction with or without baking however the former has very high thermal inertia while the clay stoves crack in operation unless very good quality clay is used which is not available everywhere view of the above there is a need to carry out more research on materials which can be suitable for stove construction the following topics for research are recommended for further of various types of clay particularly found in various parts of the country for its composition and various properties relevant to stove manufacturing this should include determination of dependence of the properties on temperature the clay can be characterized in raw form as well as after firing the firing temperatures and the firing cycle can be another important parameter with different types of additives in clay for attaining the desired properties this can form multiple projects with different groups experimenting with different types of with other ceramics with different of various alloys of metals for the desired of a material would mean determination of composition of the material its microstructure and the dependence of the same with temperature the material would also need to be characterized for its thermal and mechanical properties and their dependence on temperature properties relevant to thermal behaviour would include density thermal conductivity specific heat and hence thermal diffusivity while mechanical properties would include the tensile and compressive strength and coefficients of thermal fundamental phenomena in a biomass cookstove is a complex engineering device involving closely coupled phenomena like pyrolysis combustion fluid flow and heat transfer the complex coupling between these makes the problem highly and hence difficult to tackle in totality there is a vast body of literature on some of these fundamental processes appendix d gives a selected list of references covering fundamental processes as well as applied aspects pertaining to stoves however there is still a lot to be done in these fields in the context of stoves the need for further work has been discussed here briefly for each of the processes considerable literature is available on pyrolysis the composition of pyrolysis products factors affecting pyrolysis much of the literature is related to pyrolysis of single particles of a material for cookstove design the pyrolysis of a fuel bed is much more relevant in recent years there has been more literature on modeling of pyrolysis this needs to be supplemented by experimental work on bed pyrolysis to determine various products of pyrolysis obtained under different conditions this would be particularly relevant to the design of gasifier stoves fuel combustion is indeed much more complex than liquid or gaseous fuel combustion due to processes of pyrolysis the solid fuel combustion takes place in two stages flaming combustion of volatiles and glowing combustion of char modelling of flaming combustion becomes rather difficult due to lack of precise information on the species forming the product of pyrolysis in a given situation the variation in this can be very large on the other hand char combustion also depends heavily on the surface area exposed which in turn will depend on the way the bed is laid out the rate of pyrolysis and the fluid flow through the bed including effects of turbulence and radiation makes the problem much more complex for the other hand even experimental work is limited in case of solid fuels for design of any combustion chamber using a solid fuel shape of the chamber its area its height and volume if the is are of utmost importance if the combustion chamber has a grate its size determines the fuel burning rate and hence power of the stove if it is a stove without grate as in the case of a rocket stove the diameter of the chamber is important however this dependence is not available in any quantitative form on the other hand the height of the combustion chamber should be related to the flame height there is hardly any literature available on flame height for different solid fuels under different conditions of primary to secondary air ratio gasifier stoves more experimental work and modelling needs to be done to correlate gasifier diameter with fuel burning rate and hence power rating of the stove similarly for such stoves modelling of the coupled processes is required for more optimal designs of flow and heat in a forced flow cookstove the one with a fan the two phenomena are decoupled in forced convection case the correlations for pressure drop and convective heat transfer are fairly however under turbulent conditions with radiation the available literature may not be sufficient for complex geometry of a typical cookstove there is a need to strengthen this information through sound experimental work as well as modelling surface radiation itself is quite complex with participative medium having soot carbon dioxide and water vapour further work is required in modeling of such above picture gets even more complicated with natural convection while at low temperature relevant to electronic cooling a lot of work is available in the literature on natural convection same is not true for high temperature natural convection there is a need for modelling as well as experimental work in this area to be able to generate correlations which can help in designing the stoves whether in the gasifier mode or view of the above discussion the following topics are suggested for further work to determine pyrolysis products for different range of conditions prevailing in a typical of dependence of rate of pyrolysis in a fuel bed on parameters like moisture content of the fuel fuel shape and size bed dimensions and porosity rate of heating work on determination of flame height for different solid fuels as functions of different parameters like grate chamber dimensions fuel size bed porosity fuel bed height ratio and primary to secondary air ratio of dependence of fuel burn rate on dimensions of the fuel bed bed porosity ratio and air of coupled phenomena in a gasifier configuration and parametric analysis for the quality of gas and modelling to determine the role of radiation surface as well as gas and particulate radiation in a typical stove configuration with fuel bed under forced flow of high temperature natural convection with radiation surface and to determine the dependence of induced air on various parameters and contribution of radiation in natural convection above are just broad guidelines each of the above can result in multiple projects carried out by several product the earlier sections deal with fundamental aspects of the various phenomena taking place in the cookstoves for development of a saleable product a more interdisciplinary approach is required here the foremost is interaction with the field workers and the prospective users to understand their requirements from a very early stage of product development and through the entire developmental process interaction with health experts would also be very beneficial from an early stage of product development the development of a technically sound product would also demand analysis of the integrated unit for clean and efficient combustion efficient heat transfer as well as material durability with cost considerations is a very important parameter to be built into the product design process here the issue of centralized manufacturing vs a decentralized one is very relevant in the process of discussions leading to the present recommendations different opinions came into fore on whether the stoves should be locally manufactured or manufactured centrally to ensure quality control of the product it finally emerged that both approaches have to be supported but ensuring quality control so even in decentralized manufacturing certain critical components may be centrally manufactured and supplied around which the local manufacturers can build the final product these aspects significantly influence the engineering design of the final final product must also meet safety requirements must be ergonomically sound user friendly and must not require much maintenance it is also preferred that the design should enable the maintenance of the product by any mechanic dealing with general appliances the stove being designed requires processed fuel work needs to be carried out simultaneously for development of suitable technology for fuel processing if it is not already available view of the above discussion it is proposed that the formation of consortia should be encouraged for product development drawing from groups with different expertise an integrated approach to product design right from the beginning with inputs from different experts is likely to go a long way in enabling development of more acceptable technologies both from the point of view of the user and the technical performance of the research in health and social is also recommended that projects be funded by the government for the health and social institutes to carry out studies relevant to impact of cookstoves on the health and lives of the users these studies must first collect the baseline data in regions where traditional stoves are in use and later study the impact of using improved stoves in these regions on the health and other social aspects particularly of women and technical consultancy centres the design and development of stoves has been carried out traditionally by several groups across the world even without a scientific and technical background the design of a high performance product would demand a scientific and technical backing as discussed above on the other hand a stoves contest does not limit the contestants to only scientific and technical community there is a likelihood of anybody with a good intuitive feel to come up with a good design or at least a design which has a potential to be converted into a good product with some scientific inputs it must also be noted that while many aspects of stove design can be based on the scientific principles the basic configuration has a lot to do with intuition and creativity besides a scientific understanding view of this it is felt that technical consultancy centres which can help the local entreprenuers in improving upon their designs would be of great value particularly for addressing the regional cooking requirements computer aided engineering tools such as softwares for computational fluid dynamics cfd finite element analysis fea computer aided thermodynamic analysis etc can be helpful in the same along with some experimental measurements such technical consultancy centres could be linked with the centres for experimental facilities however for computational analysis the centres should have their own facilities and expertise to provide inputs for improvements in stove design to the designers in the commercial consultancy mode entrepreneurs interested in setting up such a centre may be helped in the incubation period through soft loans by the government to acquire the required computational facilities in terms of hardware as well as software relevant to analysis of cookstoves or else consultancy in improving cookstoves designs could be a part of an ongoing business of an entrepreneur in for other technologies as well many such companies are in the business with large companies outsourcing some of their tasks to these smaller in such a situation the government could help the consultant in acquiring softwares specifically useful for cookstoves analysis through soft loans also the government could provide publicity about such centres to the community of stove developers the consultants would have suitable charges for providing the technical consultancy is also proposed that the government provides financial support to the stove developers for getting the technical help from such centres since many of these developers may not be able to pay for the consultancy charges on their own dissemination strategies for a new improved cookstove the national program on improved chulhas npic approximately thirty million improved cook stoves were disseminated throughout the level of success of the programme varied across the country as cooking needs are different in each region and each state utilized different strategies to carry out the for instance the himachal pradesh program initially distributed stoves designed for cooking on the plains even though the higher altitude of the himalayan villages calls for different stove requirements these stoves proved however the himachal pradesh program learned from this mistake and assessed regional cooking needs after stoves were developed and installed the program was more under npic initially the target specified the installation of a certain number of improved stoves in a state but in the target was modified to cover a certain number of villages in a though the primary focus of npic was fuel conservation it also attempted to increase the acceptance of the stove by raising awareness on health benefits of reduced indoor air pollution it was assumed that if women understood the health benefits of the improved stove for their families especially their children they would be more motivated to switch to the new however in many regions these efforts did not prove as successful as some studies have demonstrated that potential health benefits are not reason enough for some people to adopt new cooking practices so focusing on the health aspects of improved stoves may not be the most effective marketing strategy for every experts agree that npic could have been improved with more systematic quality in addition to this a more robust evaluation and monitoring system would have ensured proper construction and maintenance of cook stoves users in many states might have also benefited from further education about how to use and maintain the therefore it is essential that in order to implement a successful cook stove program the lessons learned from the past initiatives must be taken into consideration when formulating a new program key elements of improved chulha review of past and ongoing improved cook stove programs which can be read in appendix e illustrates that the key elements to an effective improved chulha initiative are as technology which includes and performance standards as already discussed in the earlier market development commercialization would provide sustainability and the need to earn profits would motivate retailers to market the stoves and sell as many as possible for commercialization to succeed there must be demand for improved chulhas currently there is little or limited demand for improved cook stoves because women already have their cooking needs fulfilled by traditional chulhas and are unaware that better options exist therefore great focus on developing a market for improved cookstoves through an extensive awareness and marketing campaign is necessary in order to take forward a more sustainable approach to dissemination production and areas the initiative should start with the areas best prepared to implement it these areas have widespread financial services strong existing delivery channels managerial experience and available production mass production of stoves in or regional facilities must be executed in order to ensure quality of dealers in order to reach as many households as possible an extensive network of dealers must be utilized this network could include entrepreneurs and existing small shops and training of entrepreneurs if the entrepreneur model is utilized entrepreneurs should be carefully selected based on ability and motivation once selected these entrepreneurs must be given technical training in installation operation maintenance and servicing as well as marketing and business financing if villagers must pay for the stoves themselves they will have a greater interest in understanding and using the technology additionally they will be in a position to demand quality installation and maintenance from the stove retailers however the improved chulhas are too expensive for many potential consumers so stoves and in some cases fuel should be made more affordable with incentives for manufacturers subsidies for users loans would be the most important factor in providing financial operation and of users users must be taught how to properly operate and maintain the improved cook retailers should provide repair services to users whose stoves stop functioning properly so that the stoves do not fall into disrepair and end up monitoring and evaluation in order to ensure that villagers are actually adopting and properly using the stoves an independent entity should evaluate and monitor installed stoves if stoves are not being adopted an investigation should identify areas of the initiative that can be recommendations in this section for effective dissemination of stoves address elements through as elements and are discussed in sections and respectively recommendations for commercialization and market development a mass awareness and promotional stated earlier commercialization is crucial to the success of the improved cook stove initiative and market development is necessary to achieve commercialization market research and assessment for cook stoves must be carried out to determine the existing demand for the product factors that influence this demand and which benefits of the stoves should be emphasized in an advertising campaign depending on the priorities of the families such benefits may include improved quality of health due to fewer emissions and time saved from a reduced need to collect firewood and faster cooking time however it seems that many families place economic benefit money saved from reduction in fuel consumption as the top priority so the campaign should focus on this concern furthermore in most households in rural india the man of the house is the whereas the woman is the cookstove user the campaign must focus on both men and women in order to successfully convince households to purchase improved cookstoves order to develop a market for improved cookstoves a widespread awareness campaign to educate potential cookstove users about the benefits of using a cookstove should be carried out such an undertaking which would involve manufacturers marketing companies local ngos retailers and even the users could utilize a mass media campaign demonstrations in the villages and advertising a partnership ppp as discussed in a later section could facilitate this publicity publicity and engagement with the community should be employed in new cookstove initiative to spread awareness widely and effectively marketing blitz should utilize all forms of media including print radio television posters billboards etc in order to reach as many people as many times as possible however many potential consumers may not have televisions so the greatest focus should not be on television commercials all text and audio should be in the local because many villagers may not be literate illustrative graphics must accompany any printed text so that the meaning is clear to all potential users use of technology should be utilized as well for example games on mobile phones have been used to spread awareness to million and similar games could be created for improved cookstoves the vast majority of mobile phone users in rural india are men so mobile phone games would reach out to the of the mass media campaigns should take place on the state level and the project management unit as discussed in part b of this chapter could organize campaigns within each region the marketing departments of manufacturers and retail companies in the partnership network could collaborate to come up with and implement marketing strategies also marketing companies could be hired by the partnership to help with the channels such as schools health clinics and social services institutions reach every village in india these institutions have the greatest influence on behavior change if an awareness campaign could leverage these channels it could directly contact and impact even the most remote communities people visit health and social service institutions they could be given information about the benefits of improved cookstoves and how and where to acquire them this information can be in the form of pamphlets and posters on the walls of the buildings housing these institutions both the pamphlets and posters should employ graphics that provide clear explanations to illiterate people employees of the health and social service institutions should discuss the health social and economic benefits of and how to purchase an improved cookstove with every person who visits programs in schools could effectively raise awareness by targeting children and their parents children could be given homework assignments that increase their understanding of the benefits of improved cookstoves as well as require them to share this knowledge with their families and communities for instance they could prepare presentations and skits with the help of their parents about the health social and economic benefits of improved cookstoves and then perform these presentations for the village furthermore other initiatives such as and swine flu awareness have involved children parading through the streets of their villages carrying signs and chanting slogans a similar activity could be employed for improved chulha awareness these assignments and activities would reinforce the learning after the school day and pass on the message to their communities the ppp local governments should grant manufacturers retailers and ngos access to these health social and educational institutions in the villages these stakeholders would exploit these channels by preparing and implementing the necessary programs and materials potential consumer may be more likely to purchase an improved chulha if she sees how it works therefore demonstrations of the technology in villages should be an integral part of the awareness campaign these demonstrations could take place in schools houses of worship exhibition halls or any other place that could be used to host a public gathering demonstrators should focus on the benefits of improved chulhas and show how the cookstoves work by actually cooking something in front of the village audience while the demonstrators cook they should emphasize how little biomass is required how quickly the food cooks and how little smoke is emitted testimony about how improved chulhas have improved their lives from users who have already adopted these cookstoves could influence a village audience as well project management unit of the ppp could discuss strategies for village demonstrations and members of the partnership network could work together to implement these strategies village demonstrations should be carried out by retailers who are motivated by the pursuit of profit and local ngos which understand and are trusted by the communities advertising would be the most effective marketing tool in rural areas users should be encouraged to tell their social networks about their experiences with the new stove such marketing should be encouraged by the retailers for example the retailers might be able to have a promotion if a woman tells her friend about the stove and then the friend mentions her name when purchasing the stove the first woman could receive a discount on the stove or the order to become recognizable and appealing to the potential users the initiative should focus on branding the polio immunization strategy of branding was successful and a similar strategy can be emulated for improved cookstoves an attractive logo and possibly a simple slogan should be created to accompany every aspect of the awareness campaign celebrities such as star athletes and actors and actresses from bollywood and the local language film industries could be recruited to act as spokespeople and appear in campaign ads thereby bringing more attention to the initiative ideally the initiative should become a household recommendations for pilot new cookstove initiative should start with targeted communities that are most likely to adopt the new stoves these targeted areas can serve as pilot programs the project management unit discussed in part b of this chapter can select the initial communities families in regions where fuel is purchased or is difficult to collect and where stoves are generally used indoors so that smoke causes noticeable cleanliness and hygiene problems are more likely to adopt the new stoves furthermore socioeconomic levels and levels of education should be targeted areas should be selected based on existing strengths in financial institutions biomass availability managerial and technical readiness determined by past and ongoing successful cookstove dissemination projects and delivery channels to table which shows the strengths of each indian state maharashtra tamil nadu and karnataka are best equipped to successfully implement an improved cookstove dissemination project maharashtra has microfinance institutions biomass residue surplus density at least four ongoing cook stove projects and at least four rural delivery networks tamil nadu has microfinance institutions biomass residue surplus density at least four ongoing cook stove projects and at least three rural delivery networks karnataka has microfinance institutions biomass residue surplus density at least three ongoing cook stove projects and at least three rural delivery networks the states include andhra pradesh haryana madhya pradesh and uttar pradesh in nsip regions entered a competition to prove their ability and willingness to successfully implement the cookstove initiative and the best regions were such a strategy is not necessarily the best way to select communities for pilot programs but it should be explored initiative should aim to have several pilot programs in place within the next few years these pilots should utilize a wide variety of delivery models including existing and new models many models must be tested in these pilot programs so that the best models can be selected in future strengths of each strength in financial institutions is interpreted as more than institutions or people and strength in biomass in all socioeconomic levels both and approaches must be employed multiple delivery channels and supply chains should be utilized in each region existing networks can vary audiences methods of delivery types of services etc for instance a big corporation will operate differently than petty the viability of each for cookstove dissemination should first be analyzed for each state or region several delivery mechanisms should be assessed before the best options are selected as different mechanisms would be successful under various circumstances in each region with existing value chains for cook stove dissemination could be created by the various stakeholders in the partnership but it may be more efficient to collaborate with companies and programs that have existing delivery networks the details of a few examples of such companies and programs are given in appendix e these examples are only illustrative and by no means exhaustive strategies from and potential opportunities to collaborate with some of these initiatives include shakti the women entrepreneurs cover a population of about million people in the smallest villages in fifteen states so this network may be able to distribute cook stoves to a huge number of people in remote villages if the health benefits of improved chulhas are emphasized then the cook stoves might fit well with the health and hygiene mission however it is possible that these women already have enough responsibilities spreading hygiene awareness and selling hll products therefore they may be unable to take on a cook stove project in any case a new cook stove initiative should consider leveraging existing groups as project shakti partnership for handwashing with soap although cook stove dissemination probably cannot on a handwashing initiative some of the strategies can be replicated by partnering with state governments or the government of india a chulha program would be able to reach a much greater percentage of the population the program could effectively raise awareness about and create demand for improved chulhas by promoting the benefits of improved chulhas through government channels such as schools health clinics and social services institutions the schools and health clinics could focus on the health benefits while the social services institutions could emphasize the reduced cooking time and fuel this program may not be ideal for collaboration to disseminate cook stoves because the entrepreneurs sanchalaks are male farmers who neither use the stoves nor have the hereditary role of building stoves while information about cook stoves could be posted on the websites it is unlikely that farmers using the internet for agricultural transactions will have any interest in reading about cook stoves however emphasis on fostering and maintaining the trust should be applied to any chulha retail chains such as hariyali kisaan bazaar and tata kisan sansar agricultural retail chains already sell household products so they would easily be able to add improved cook stoves to their inventory if tks is willing to collaborate with a cook stove initiative its training centers and exhibition halls could potentially be utilized to put on technology demonstrations and cook stove awareness programs in the with existing government programs to reach vulnerable government programs already reach out to the most vulnerable populations in order to expand the cookstove initiative to the bottom of the pyramid and utilize a approach links with these programs should be established a few examples include the rajiv gandhi grameen vidyutikaran yojana rggvy rural electrification scheme literacy programme indira awaas yojana rural housing scheme and antenatal care rggvy aims to electrify all households by because an unelectrified house is likely to be a poor one dissemination of cookstoves in collaboration with this scheme could reach out to some of the most vulnerable households a forced draft or blower stove could naturally accompany electrification and would cost relatively little compared to the electrical literacy program the literacy program works toward eliminating female illiteracy focusing on women as the receivers of cookstoves makes sense as they are the users a cookstove could be provided as a reward when a woman attains literacy in fact the cookstove and literacy could act as incentives for each other depending on the priorities in other words receiving an improved cookstove could motivate a woman to reach literacy or reaching literacy could incentivize a woman to own an improved housing scheme an improved stove would naturally go with improved housing also an improved stove would be only a small additional cost compared to the cost of care centres the most vulnerable periods for air pollution exposure are during pregnancy and early infancy pregnant women who attend antenatal care centres are already in the public system and receiving a number of services including education diagnostic services medication and incentives to deliver their children in institutions even the costliest forced draft stove would be about or less of the cash incentives in many states rs option is being investigated in the stove a research project led by professor kirk r smith at university of school of public health that is exploring cookstove dissemination via the prenatal care system including anganwadi centers approximately eighty percent of pregnancies in india are seen by the prenatal care system women receive nutritional information and iron tablets and get directed to a delivery institute dissemination of cookstoves could target the women who come to the prenatal health centers and be limited to first pregnancies of which there are about seven million per year pilot studies utilizing this option are already underway in tamil nadu and potential collaboration opportunities include the khadi and village industries commission water sanitation schemes government schools and the health system use of the stove could be subsidized through any of the above programs for instance for a limited time perhaps one year for every month the stove is used the household could receive a small payment monitoring equipment which is currently available would need to be installed in the hopefully if a woman gets used to the new stove she would continue to use it after the subsidy of petty shops addition to collaboration with these programs improved cook stoves could be sold in small shops that are already involved in selling energy products such as leds photovoltaic products etc tapping into this network of petty shops could significantly increase the reach of the cook stove initiative into remote areas programs have utilized the village entrepreneur model to varying degrees of success see discussions in appendix as aforementioned in section these entrepreneurs can be individual women hereditary potters who have traditionally sold stoves or groups or collectives there is already an extensive network of groups through the country so this network could be leveraged to expand the cookstove initiative to poor households entrepreneurs would have to receive training in cookstove installation operation and maintenance as well as business training such training could be provided by manufacturers and local ngos entrepreneurs since they have the motivation to earn profits should be involved in marketing the stoves in their villages furthermore they must teach their clients how to operate their stoves and provide maintenance and repair recommendations for ensuring servicing and cookstoves can not be fully adopted if they do not continue to operate properly therefore maintenance and servicing are integral to ensuring that stoves will be adopted in order for maintenance and servicing to be carried out effectively they must be decentralized and executed at a local retailers whether they are entrepreneurs groups rural retail chains like tks or hkb or part of an existing governmental or nongovernmental initiative will need to provide maintenance and repairs services as they already operate on the local level also once the consumer purchases a stove from the retailer a relationship is established and regular interaction may take place thus it may be easiest for consumers to go to the same place they bought their stoves for servicing and cleaning will need to be carried out primarily by the users in their homes so the retailers will need to provide maintenance information and training to those who purchase the stoves from them repairs services should be provided by the retailers each improved cookstove could be sold with a warranty under the warranty scheme servicing by the retailer would be provided free of charge for a certain amount of time perhaps the first one or two manufacturers and local ngos would partake in training the retailers in these by women major challenge to successful adoption is that women have been cooking with the traditional chulha for generations a behavior change like this is difficult when the behavior is such an ingrained habit and tradition the role of women leaders such as women representatives in the panchayat and collectives should not be overlooked these women are in influential positions and can have a significant impact on the behaviors of women in their women leaders should be educated by local ngos about the advantages of improved cookstove use and encouraged to talk to the families about these benefits furthermore perhaps these women leaders could be selected as the first adopters in the village after they use the improved stoves and see the benefits firsthand hopefully they would promote the improved cookstoves in their communities these women leaders could even be given the stoves at a reduced cost more reduced than the planned reductions for everyone else or paid a small sum of cash in exchange for their active promotion of improved cookstove adoption among their communities recommendations for financial arrangements for delivery improved chulhas are too expensive for many families financial assistance in some form is necessary financial mechanisms must be put in place to minimize the cost of stoves so that they are affordable for as many people as possible financial assistance for improved cookstoves should be considered an energy security expense as these stoves will reduce the use of subsidies on capital cost program can consider implementing the following no direct subsidy some past improved cook stove programs subsidies were detrimental to adoption and commercialization users who did not invest enough in the stove did not value it and therefore did not make efforts to adopt it furthermore if they did not have to pay for the stove previously they would likely be unwilling to pay much for a stove once commercialization is underway programs including nisp and ceramic jiko stove program have been successful without subsidies in both china and kenya consumers paid full price for the improved cook stoves in kenya stoves were initially too expensive and very few were purchased and adopted however as more companies started manufacturing stoves competition led to innovations quality improved and costs decreased until the ceramic jiko stoves became affordable hundreds of thousands of these stoves have been adopted in kenya and this initiative has influenced cook stove programs in thirty african continually decreasing subsidy that continue to gradually decrease could make the stoves affordable for the poorer consumers while still allowing for commercialization over time cooking efficiency improvement and new fuels marketing project ceinfmp which was carried out from to by the ethiopian energy authority eea and later the ethiopian rural energy development and promotion center eredpc reduced the cost of stoves for users with small and continually decreasing subsidies with these declining subsidies commercialization of cook stoves was slowly and successfully same approach could be taken in india mnre with funding from the government of india could implement a small continually decreasing subsidy for consumers eventually when commercialization of improved cook stoves is achieved and cook stoves are more affordable the subsidy should be removed draft and forced draft improved cook stoves cost approximately inr and inr therefore each stove will target a different economic class and each should receive different levels of subsidies furthermore households below poverty line bpl could receive additional subsidies see table for the number of bpl and above poverty line apl households by state the list includes urban households as the last fiscal year approximately crore indian rupees were spent on subsidizing lpg fuel which is used mostly by the middle and upper classes the current lpg subsidy does not discriminate based on income everyone including those who can afford the full unsubsidized cost of lpg benefits from the subsidy yet the poorest classes do not benefit from any cooking subsidy as they cannot afford the lpg stove or the subsidized cylinders thus money is spent to benefit the rich but not the poor for the equivalent annual cost of the current lpg subsidy the poorest households could benefit from a subsidized improved cook stove table shows under various subsidy scenarios the cost of subsidizing a single stove and the number of improved cook stoves that can be disseminated for the equivalent cost of the current lpg subsidy subsidies are considered for both the capital cost of the stove and the interest of month loans to purchase the stove see the next section for more in many cases all households can adopt an improved cook stove for less than the equivalent expenditure on the lpg number of households below poverty line bpl and above poverty line apl by state or union and nicobar and nagar and and the beginning of the program subsidies should be kept simple so one subsidy scheme should apply to all of india however as new stove designs are introduced they will inevitably vary by region some regions may require more complex designs or more expensive materials than other regions so the costs will not be uniform nationwide therefore after a few years of initiation of the initiative the subsidies must be tailored to each region should be an annual assessment of the subsidy and the subsidy should be decreased by approximately to each year there must be an exit strategy to eliminate the subsidy within a few years so the declining rate must remain steady the time frame for the subsidy changes and exit strategy should be publicly announced well in advance so that producers and consumers are not surprised by them set dates for subsidy decreases will give the producers motivation to quickly come up with innovations that will reduce stove on improved cook stoves such as first oorja stove use pelletized biomass for fuel these pellets cost five to seven rupees per these stoves will sell most successfully in areas where people are already purchasing fuel for example if they live far from a forest or use however these pellets are not affordable for poor households since other fuels including cooking fuels such as lpg are subsidized perhaps pellets and other improved cookstove fuel should be subsidized as subsidy for pelletized biomass fuel similar to the subsidy for lpg approximately would promote the development of an alternative technology that is a domestic renewable fuel rather than an imported fossil fuel this subsidy could over time reduce government costs on lpg subsidies as households adopt a cleaner fuel with service the price of pellets for customers could potentially be less than the price of lpg if the subsidy is structured wisely although it would be challenging to reduce the lpg subsidy under the current political situation the cost of implementing the pellet subsidy would initially be relatively small in comparison because there are fewer uses for pelletized biomass a subsidy for pellets is likely to be less than the subsidy for lpg the pellet subsidy could be assessed regarding its effectiveness in reducing lpg consumption and increasing biomass consumption after several cash transfer for cookstove order to promote use of improved cookstoves a conditional cash transfer scheme could be put into place according to the world bank cash transfer programs provide cash payments to poor households that meet certain behavioral requirements generally related to health care and in tamil nadu a conditional cash transfer program to keep girls in school has been successful for every month a girl attends school that family receives a cash payment families are paid because if girls are not in school they could be earning money for their the cookstove initiative a conditional cash transfer program would pay households a small amount for instance fifty rupees for each month the stove is used the hope is that with an incentive to actually use the improved cookstoves families would become accustomed to and recognize the benefits of the new stove and therefore continue to use it after the conditional cash transfer program ends however monitoring equipment in each household would be required to track usage this could be an expensive and challenging therefore perhaps only the first adopters would be monitored hopefully these households would enjoy the benefits of the improved cookstove and spread the word about these benefits to their neighbors and tax including excise duty and tax vat vary from state to state these taxes can significantly increase the cost of an improved cook stove for example selco sells improved cook stoves with a total tax rate in in some places total taxes can constitute up to of the final to reduce the final cost of improved cook stoves mnre should consider partially or fully subsidizing these and other mechanisms can only decrease the cost of cookstoves to a certain point many of the poorest consumers will still be unable to afford the cookstoves financial institutions such as banks and microfinance institutions mfis can provide financial assistance in the form of loans to consumers who cannot afford to purchase the stoves on their own loans might prove to be the most effective financing strategy for the poor loans could also be provided to micro small and medium enterprises msmes entrepreneurs groups for working capital to sell cookstoves groups already have connections with nationalized banks so they would be a good target for loans a detailed assessment of mfi across different states in india see table indicates that there are a number of states including andhra pradesh karnataka maharashtra and orissa where the initiative can be taken forward with active support from order to facilitate loans mnre should establish connections with nationalized banks commercial banks and microfinance institutions mnre as the catalyst for the ppp should send an open invitation to all financial institutions to join the improved cook stove partnership as members of the ppp the financial institutions can collaborate with other stakeholders and partake in cook stove dissemination activities by providing financial services such as loans if necessary perhaps mnre could provide bulk loans at low interest rates to the financial institutions who give loans to improved cook stove consumers furthermore mnre could subsidize the interest on the loan for instance if a villager owes interest mnre could pay so that the villager only needs to pay table loan interest draft capital to subsidize one stove draft capital to subsidize one stove equivalent of year lpg equivalent of years of lpg years loan not funds crore not funds crore microfinance institutions by or union lakh and nicobar and nagar and and assessment of biomass processing number of improved cookstove models are being used in different parts of the country these models are classified into two broad categories i natural draft ii forced draft new while rural households mainly use fuelwood collected from nearby forests for meeting their cooking energy requirements it has been observed that in order to achieve the best performance from improved in terms of combustion efficiency and reduced use of processed fuels is essential especially in forced draft cookstoves has a vast variety of woody and agro based biomass residues that can be effectively utilized as cooking fuel by rural households however most of these types of biomass require processing in order to prove effective in devices processing of biomass either requires compacting of loose biomass into or downsizing of bigger size woody biomass like pruned branches of trees or like stalks using a simple cutter the sizing of biomass is essential and amongst the most important components of a supply system of processed fuel due to the scattered nature of the biomass their harvesting collection and transportation present major challenges in establishing biomass supply processing chain india the most common biomass residue processing technology being practiced is briquetting technology in which a ram and piston press is used to manufacture briquettes of mm diameter and above the process of briquettes manufacture includes screening drying and pulverizing depending upon the type and quality of raw material the cost of briquetted fuels for use is well justified in industrial and commercial sectors as replacement of coal or other commercial fuels however due to their size and high cost briquettes are not an effective solution for applications other biomass processing technology is pelletizing where biomass is converted into pellets using smaller dies less than mm biomass pellets can directly be used in the improved cook stoves or chulhas pelletizing technology is very popular in europe but the indian experience on pelletizing of is very group has done research on all these issues and has come up with the following set of recommendations for consideration the detailed report with material and analysis which helped in arriving at these recommendations is given in appendix cookstove program for dissemination in rural household applications will need to combine the effects of two thrust areas technological improvements in the stoves and establishment of an assured fuel supply chain for the development of appropriate biomass processing technology and associated fuel supply system the following recommendations are assessment of biomass and currently available processing technologies needs to be carried is an urgent need for research and development in technology innovation and adaptation demonstration and field testing of fuel processing unit should be carried out in selected regions in the development is key to large scale deployment of the assessment of biomass and its processing technologies is proposed to carryout the assessment study in different regions in the country to determine current cooking prices type and quantity of fuel used cooking fuel expenditure affordability and willingness to pay for processed fuels and general consumer behaviour etc this type of assessment study would help in regions in the country where first pilot demonstration of setting up fuel processing unit can be initiated general data is available on the availability of biomass residues in india but this data is rather old an assessment study should be carried out for biomass and charcoal availability in the short listed regions this study would help in gathering information about the type of biomass and charcoal available in the regions quantity available current usage costs and their suitability in terms of physiochemical properties to make pellets the information will help in focusing research and development studies on biomass and charcoal conversion technology and its adaptation specifically for these is also recommended that the existing fuel supply chain experiences be documented highlighting the special features of the technology its economic performance and challenges faced by these experiences this would help in identifying the key barriers and drawing lessons to build and design the research and development in technology innovation and adaptation is proposed to focus the research and development on two broad development of decentralized biomass pelletizing machine is required for the development and adaptation of a biomass pelletizing machine for production of fuel pellets from available the major challenge is that india has very limited experience in pelletizing technology while the european machines are generally of high capacity and are also mainly developed for sawdust the use of is limited hence research should be carried out to pelletizing machines for locally available biomass residues and also evolve standards for equipment in particular the should aim in identifying appropriate existing pelletizing and briquetting technology and of the machines suitable for rural operation in a capacity range of with low input electricity consumption this work can be done in technology collaboration mode involving existing equipment manufacturers research institutes technical development of efficient charcoal production can also be used to produce charcoal a cleaner cooking fuel charcoal production is practiced in many parts of the country as a livelihood option but through the use of traditional inefficient kilns it is recommended that be carried out to develop an efficient closed loop decentralized unit based on agricultural residues further the char can be easily briquetted and utilized in appropriate cooking devices subsequently stoves must be used to conduct detailed studies on the combustion of these fuels including their physiochemical properties and emission levels measured as per the standard pilot demonstration and field testing of fuel processing technologies that evolve from the work on biomass processing should be pilot tested for actual field operation by installing a few in different and studying their performances the detailed performance of these machines should be assessed and based on the learnings from the demonstration phase these can further be improved upgraded and eventually for installation in other entrepreneur development and deployment of the is envisaged to involve community in planning implementation and management of biomass processing system to supply the processed fuels at affordable price to the rural households it is suggested that mnre should explore the possibility of linkage with nrega national rural employment guarantee act for production collection and processing of biomass in rural areas that achieves twin objectives of rural development and employment this would help in reducing the production cost of fuel processing and making the processed fuel to the end users the unit can be operated as a business unit by the village panchayats or as a franchise leased out to an ngo or a self help group the unit will have to collect the biomass from the community and supply the processed biomass as per the cost structure determined by the panchayat should be central to such a rural energy initiative they have traditionally been managing local resources such as fuelwood cow dung and water with adequate training unit can provide a unique opportunity for women to organize and plan for processed biomass production to manage energy enterprises and own them particularly for meeting the energy needs for cooking this can significantly improve the quality of life of women in villages issue which will have to be addressed is the diversion of processed fuel to other particularly industrial activity the industrial use is also likely to raise the selling price of processed fuel adversely affecting its use for domestic purposes this problem would need local solutions with the help of village panchayats here groups can play an important role to ensure supply of fuel for domestic cooking first and supply of only surplus for industrial recommendations for work on community many issues pertaining to domestic stoves are also relevant for community stoves there are also some differences particularly in clientele which calls for some differences in approach while dealing with community cookstoves these have been highlighted community stoves vs domestic foremost difference between domestic and community stoves which has called for a separate treatment for the latter is the difference in the users the costumers for these stoves are either restaurants or hostels places of worship residential monasteries or ashrams caterers suppliers of meals for schools etc the customers falling in the category of private parties are expected to purchase an improved stove while the organizations can get governmental support for replacing their original inefficient devices with the new more efficient ones for private parties the stove can be an attractive investment if they can save fuel cost substantially due to their better efficiency even other organizations are willing to pay for improved devices if they lead to increased convenience thus the strategies adopted for deployment of community stoves can be very different from the domestic ones if the stove performs well resulting in fuel saving as well as reduction in emissions coupled with ease of operation it is likely to be adopted by the users and hence the market forces can be used effectively on the other hand the acceptance of domestic stoves is a much more complex issues due to cultural aspects no financial earnings from the stove and hence initial cost playing a very major role of the women in switching to something new decision making power resting with men in many situations not giving much importance to need for a good stove etc the domestic stoves the variability of fuel can be quite high while in community stoves the fuel is generally purchased in lots and hence the variability is likely to be much less the use of the community stove will be for much longer time at a stretch as compared to the domestic stoves which have much shorter cooking cycles this results in more uniform performance of the community stoves as compared to the domestic stoves and hence easier acceptability and better these differences pose advantages in dissemination of community stoves over the domestic stoves there are also several issues some of them common to domestic stoves which need to be important issues to be addressed in community community stoves are being built and propagated by many organizations in the country just like the domestic stoves they are different from each other in terms of the form of the fuel they use big logs small twigs processed fuel briquettes or chopped wood or powdery biomass they may be forced draught or natural draught based they may be fixed or portable etc however there are no protocols available for testing of these stoves to compare them on any common platform there is a need for such protocols to be evolved for different types of community stoves for lab testing as well as field testing this should include thermal performance as well as emissions testing the current bis standards specify the volume of water used for water boiling tests on large sized stoves however this test does not test the stove for low power and does not account for the impact on refueling rate on the stove performance thus for generating reliable and repeatable numbers corresponding to performance of these stoves there is a need for evolving protocols as was suggested for the domestic evolution of protocols there is also a need to set up facilities for certification of these stoves many of these stoves are and are also made in situ in small testing facilities it may be difficult to build stoves of large sizes unless a stove has a standardized process of manufacturing at least of the critical parts every stove may require certification since any small change in dimensions of the critical parts can strongly affect the performance thus testing facilities envisaged must take into account these aspects standards for acceptable level of emissions for stoves with chimney can be taken to be those applicable for industrial furnaces of similar power ratings the emission standards for stoves without chimney can also be similar to those in industrial environments of similar scales of of community stoves also requires like domestic stoves thus in the plan for capacity building for the community stoves component must also be considered technical support centres recommended for domestic stoves can be used even more effectively for improvement in the design of community stoves since the community stove manufacturers may be in a position to make the necessary investment for the purpose fuel supply also needs to be considered the size of the fuel pieces required for community stoves is generally much larger than that for the domestic stoves thus the fuel supply chain may be different for the two kinds of stoves moreover the community stoves will have to compete with boilers and other industrial furnaces for fuel however due to large requirements in the fuel setting up a decentralized fuel processing unit and supply chain may be easier for community strategies for these stoves would be quite different from domestic stoves as discussed earlier there is a need for identifying several business models which can work for different organizations using the community long term vs short term issues enumerated above have to be largely addressed in a long term work plan however if a pilot programme has to be taken up it has to adopt a short term approach which is not in conflict with the long term one in this regard it is advantageous to develop different strategies for different categories of users meal important category of users of biomass stoves are government schools in villages and suburban areas serving meals to children since the meal scheme is supported by the government intervention of these schools for introducing improved stoves can be taken up by the government on a priority basis to develop effective strategies for deployment of improved community stoves in these schools a sample survey was undertaken of selected states covering different zones of the country the objective of the survey was to determine the current cooking practices in these meal schools and also ascertain their willingness to switch to the improved devices the survey was conducted by feedback business consulting services pvt ltd the important findings from the surveys are presented in appendix survey has indicated a high potential for deployment of improved stoves for meal cooking currently most of the village cooking meals which have been covered by the survey use handmade chulhas similar to three stone fires with purchased firewood in up about of the schools perceive the need to switch to an improved cooking device while in ap of the schools surveyed are dissatisfied with the current cooking device however even in ap only of the schools surveyed are willing to shift to an improved cookstove and only if there is government support in up of the schools have indicated willingness to adopt the new device with government the survey shows that immediate steps can be taken by the government to cater to this need in this regard first question which needs to be addressed is the selection of a community stove from a range of products available from different manufacturers for pilot dissemination in some of these at the outset it may seem that the right way is to carry out the testing of these stoves to select the most suitable stove however it must be noted that in the absence of testing protocols for different kinds of stoves such an exercise will not result which can be compared for different stoves instead for meal cooking the available community stoves need to be categorized based on the kind of fuel they use and the kind of food for which they are claimed to be best suited by the manufacturer a match between the regional needs and the stove category can help in the selection of a suitable device for a given region accordingly a few of these stoves can be given for trials in some schools in that region and monitored closely for months acceptability by the user at the pilot stage can lead to adopting a suitable strategy for ensuring long term use of the fuel by the schools since the government is giving them grant for the fuel the amount of the grant can be reduced in proportion to the expected fuel savings from the stove this would encourage them to use the stoves it may be desirable to make them pay for the stove partly after the demonstration so that they value the community stove strategies may need to be adopted for promotion of community stoves among different users the following steps may be adopted for taking up the pilot dissemination work among other the stoves based on the kind of fuel they use and the kind of food for which they are claimed to be best suited by the regions where the current manufacturers of community stoves have not reached so far identifying the fuel available in these regions and the kind of food for which the stove is likely to be used the stove categories with the regions depending on the food to be cooked and the fuel than one kind of stove can be given for trials in different in a region one kind of stove should be given to at least places in a block for comparative assessment the private parties must be required to pay for at least of the cost of the stove for the trial run while the government can bear the cost of the stove for the government supported monitoring of the same should be carried out by a monitoring and evaluation team designated for this purpose the task should be given to an independent organization the monitoring would involve data collection through logbooks given to the user and sample measurements by the team the team must make at least one visit per week to assess the extent of usage of the stove and its acceptance the trial period can be one to two months at the end of which the data collected needs to be the private parties want to use the stove even after the trial run they must be asked to pay for the remaining cost of the stove on the results of this phase the next phase of dissemination can be planned in the meantime the plan for the long term tasks at hand can also be firmed up and the next phase of dissemination can be linked to the long term b programme management and evaluation a programme of national scale to be effective the management aspects of the programme are as important as the actual constituents of the programme in this context there are some lessons to be learned from the past where certain management strategies did not work very effectively and some learning has to come from other examples where the management strategies have been successful the outset it is important to recognize that a programme of such a large magnitude can be effectively handled through participation from various parties and stakeholders from the government academia research institutes private players including small and big entrepreneurs as has been discussed in part a the proposed constituents of the programme would require involvement of all parties similarly it is proposed that a public private partnership be at the core of strategies to be adopted for management of such a programme specific recommendations regarding the same are discussed in subsequent recommendations for a public private partnership ppp would promote collaboration among all stakeholders on the improved cookstove initiative while allowing mnre to take a facilitative approach members of the partnership could take advantage of each expertise resources and activities to more effectively and efficiently disseminate cookstoves at an affordable price to remote rural areas of india for example a manufacturer or technology provider could seek out and work together with financial institutions such as commercialized banks nationalized banks multilateral development banks regional development banks and microfinance institutions delivery services providers such as agricultural retail stores or other existing supply chains and local governments in order to reduce the cost of their stoves for consumers and gain access to villages through existing distribution channels managing the program through a ppp would allow for facilitation of cooperation and collaboration of all players in every component of the program organizational devise a partnership structure for the improved cookstove initiative the united nations economic commission for guidebook on promoting good governance in was consulted and successful partnerships including the central american handwashing global partnership for handwashing with and the methane to markets were considered as models and input was garnered from the cookstove community at the meeting on recommendations for the new cookstove held on march at iit ppp needs to be established by an initiating agency comprised of a network of stakeholders and led by a governing council an administrative support group would be required to conduct administrative tasks to ensure smooth operation of the partnership and an advisory board would provide guidance to the governing council a ceo and project management unit pmu would facilitate project implementation subgroups with different areas of expertise would give input to the administrative support group advisory board and project management unit see the organizational flow chart in figure agency the initiating agency which in this case is mnre would launch the ppp responsibilities of the initiating agency and clearly articulating goals of the initiative and purposes of the the formation of the partnership an open invitation to join the partnership that clearly articulates the benefits of joining up the governing council administrative support group advisory board project management unit and a sense that the partnership belongs to each and every partner not solely to the initiating the partnership is fully established and operating under the governing council the initiating agency mnre will act as a leading member of the governing council and the key government of india partner council the governing council leads the ppp public members of the governing council could include representatives of mnre the planning commission the ministries of finance rural development and health and the central pollution control board private members of the committee would comprise representatives from a trade association of cookstove manufacturers such a trade association must first be established academic and research institutions leading ngos and financial institutions on a rotational basis additional members can be added as necessary in different stages of the initiative the representative of mnre would act as the chair the committee would meet regularly throughout the year via electronic media such as teleconferences and video conferences with at least one meeting per year responsibilities of the governing council the partnership by formulating policies and process and creating intermediate and the partnership stays focused on its the progress and effectiveness of every aspect of the initiative on a quarterly basis through a rigorous monitoring and evaluation framework and making modifications to the initiative as support group the administrative support group would take care of the administrative tasks of the partnership and work closely with the governing council and ceo of the project management unit it is suggested that members of the administrative support group should not be affiliated with any specific stakeholder and be employed by the ppp responsibilities communications between committees and meetings activities and public relations and website and newsletters and other administrative tasks as instructed by the governing board it is suggested that an advisory board should provide guidance and advice to the governing council and ceo of the project management unit the advisory board would consist of a group of experts in different areas technology dissemination finance etc and be led by a chief program advisor in order to avoid conflict of interest these experts should be independent consultants who are not currently involved in any cookstove projects in india the responsibilities of the advisory board could procedures for knowledge and recommendations from the subgroups on both the issues related to the areas of expertise and regional guidance based on recommendations to the governing council and project management unit pmu the ceo would lead the execution of the initiative with the pmu translating policy into implementation responsibilities of the ceo and pmu partnership members from government agencies organizations banks and financial institutions research and academic institutions technology providers and delivery service opportunities for implementation of cookstove dissemination including selecting targeted issues and barriers unique to various regions and suggesting solutions to address them based on input from partnership members through the communication between members action plans that involve collaboration between market assessment demand generation activities and financing subsidies and who issues subsidies on a activities and progress to governing council four subgroups would focus on different areas of the initiative and be broken into the financing subgroup technical subgroup sales and distribution subgroup and monitoring and evaluation subgroup other subgroups can be added by the governing council as it sees fit all partnership members would be allowed and encouraged to participate in the four subgroups which are proposed to be led by two one from the public sector and one from the private sector the chairs would be selected by the subgroup participants the subgroups would meet regularly via electronic media such as teleconferences and video conferences and decisions would be made by consensus responsibilities of the subgroups guidance and recommendations to the advisory board on their respective areas of with the administrative support group in order to accomplish necessary administrative in implementation activities through the project management unit including contributing regional and on financial incentives subsidies tax credits loans carbon credits clean development mechanism on performance standards testing procedures cookstove certification and distribution on marketing selling cookstoves distribution channels accessing remote rural areas means to ensure and evaluation on project monitoring evaluation of projects and of partnership members the network acts as an informal system to facilitate dialogue and collaboration among stakeholders involved in improved cookstove dissemination and to share essential knowledge and expertise with the implementers of the initiative membership in the network would be free and open to everyone and participation in the partnership is voluntary to join the partnership a prospective member would have to sign a memorandum of understanding when joining a prospective member would indicate the group to which it wants to belong government civil society financial institutions research and academic institutions technology providers or delivery service regardless of group each member can communicate with all members in the network benefits of joining and making connections with other partnership members for potential collaboration on cookstove dissemination project and business informed about dissemination activities through subcommittee meetings workshops other partnership events newsletters forums listservs partnership access to online databases including but not limited to ongoing and completed project sites available biomass by type and location and information about each partnership member recognition for accomplishments in partnership publications thereby boosting of membership in subgroup to subgroup knowledge and understanding on regional issues and different areas of projects with the guidance of the project management unit and collaborating with other partnership fulfilling the responsibilities of each member would be voluntary a member would gain more from the partnership if it participated as much as organizational structure of the organizational funds for this programme would be required at various levels and in different forms it may be pertinent to look at the fnd requirement for various components of the funding for the discussed in section competition with specific design goals and attractive prizes could stimulate innovation it has also been mentioned that china recently held a technology competition as part of its new cook stove program association for rural energy industry carei partnered with the shell foundation shell china and the center for entrepreneurship in international health and development ceihd at university of california berkeley to widely and quickly disseminate improved cook stoves the shell foundation provided the funding for the stove design competition the awards for this competition were cash prizes and publicity a group of domestic and international experts formulated criteria for the winning stove enterprises concentrating on energy efficiency ease of use durability of the stove emissions and enterprise management the stoves entered into the competition were tested according to standard procedures in a special testing facility the tests evaluated emissions carbon monoxide concentrations combustion efficiency and thermal efficiency manufacturing facilities were inspected as well independent experts carried out these assessments of product performance and manufacturing this award program will be repeated in order to continue encouraging innovation and raising awareness about the benefits of improved cook the winners receive access to capital management training and business development support as well as publicity for their products through china and bonus for exceptional an incentive for manufacturers to innovate mnre could provide a cash prize for cook stove designs that perform way beyond the established standards for example biogas support programme bsp which began in july utilized financial incentives by rewarding manufacturers whose products met certain quality and durability criteria with a cash steering committee with the guidance of the technology and financing subgroups of the advisory board could set the criteria for receiving the cash bonus the certified testing facilities would decide whether or not stoves met these exceptional criteria the funding for the cash bonus could come from mnre or a development bank belonging to the funding for technical work is proposed that the government or the catalyst discussed in section should invite proposals for and setting up testing facilities through open rfps to provide grants to research institutions academic institutions and companies developing improved cook stove designs these proposals must be considered in tandem by a single committee which could consist of members from the steering committee and the advisory group the regional subcommittees may be involved for proposals regarding setting up of test facilities is envisaged that the proposals invited would cover a wide spectrum of issues related to stoves and hence it is suggested that funding for the programme should come from various ministries apart from mnre eg min of health min of environment and forests min of rural development min of small and medium enterprises min of science and technology min of social welfare etc once the proposals are put together and the funding requirements are clear the proposals relevant to different ministries must be identified the funding process must be coordinated between different ministries overseen by the steering committee steering committee with the guidance of the technology and financing subgroups of the advisory board could come up with the grant procedures including criteria applications and awarding money for setting up field testing centres the regional subcommittees could receive applications and award grants within their regions according to the steering procedures the steering committee would need to take conflict of interest into consideration when drafting procedures as several organizations applying for grants might participate in the regional subcommittee the funding for these grants should come from mnre and development banks belonging to the ppp the projects are funded and come to execution stage they must be coordinated by the coordinating of the steering committee funding for scaling up difficult challenge for the cook stove initiative is mass production any combination of the following options could be utilized to encourage scaling up production of improved cook advance could provide advance subsidies if a manufacturer or technology provider increases production of improved cook stoves by a certain percentage then they would receive an advance subsidy payment from mnre for example in nepal bsp introduced the advance subsidy against bank guarantees in the fiscal year in order to receive the advance subsidy payment a company must increase plant production by twenty companies unable to submit bank guarantees could take advantage of a working capital revolving fund these companies receive credit when they purchase components for biogas governing council would consult with the technology and financing subgroups to establish the production criteria required to earn an advance subsidy the project management unit would determine if a manufacturer met these criteria the funding for the advance subsidy would come from mnre or a development bank production tax credit and the partnership could implement production tax credits in order to support mass production production tax credits have bolstered the wind energy sector in the united states for every of electricity produced wind energy companies receive a credit towards their income taxes because some companies do not earn enough income for this tax credit to be much of an incentive this credit can be exchanged for a grant of up to thirty percent of the property value improved cook stove ppp could implement a similar production tax credit scheme for instance for every certain number of stoves produced a manufacturing company could receive a certain amount of tax credit or choose to take a grant of up to a certain percentage of the manufacturing property value instead the governing council would determine the value of the production tax advance market commitment and government procurement advance market commitment from the government would ensure a market for products mnre another government partner could commit to purchasing a large number of stoves perhaps one million and then disseminate the stoves themselves through various existing government channels and programs this advance market commitment would motivate manufacturers to scale up production because they would have a guaranteed government could request bids from the private sector for large purchases of cookstoves at least several lakhs and potentially several crores after some time to be distributed via the various programs mentioned earlier in section the stoves to be selected must meet rigorous quality performance and cost standards and criteria if several stoves meet these requirements then targeted households could have choices in which stoves they prefer preferences would give useful information for future stove the government could procure cookstoves for its own operations this is a relatively common practice to reduce costs and drive technology development for instance some governments procure vehicles for their operations some good possibilities for procurement of cookstoves for government operations include indian railways aganwadi centres the indian army and schools that are part of the midday meal development mechanism and carbon addition to subsidies and incentives for manufacturers the clean development mechanism cdm and carbon credits should be considered for financing improved cookstoves are an application of cdm because they are relatively simple and have a relatively quick payback cdm projects encourage cooperation among government agencies private companies and academia such cooperation is critical to the success of a cook stove initiative and the ppp ningxia province china a cdm project executed jointly by ningxia fenlian co ltd and the environmental center of tsinghua university is distributing solar cookers to rural agrarian families because this project is expected to save million metric tons of coal over ten years of implementation it was eligible for cdm similarly the potential fuelwood and carbon emission savings should qualify cook stove initiative for cdm funding these potential savings must first be calculated and a robust monitoring and evaluation process that will feed into a comprehensive database must be established credits would encourage private sector participation in yanqing county china in the camco group and pioneer carbon cooperating with the county government took advantage of carbon financing to disseminate one million daxu stoves within three years thereby removing twenty eight million metric tons of carbon emissions during the first five years the camco group and pioneer carbon have the rights to the carbon credits and they use these credits to minimize the retail cost of the daxu mnre and the ppp decide to pursue cdm and carbon trading the governing council with the help of the financing subgroup could put together a task force to calculate the potential carbon savings prove additionality set up monitoring and evaluation procedures and an accompanying database and apply to the designated national authority and cdm executive board for approval and registration the money earned from selling carbon emissions reduction certificates could be used to fund any combination of the financial incentives mentioned in this revolving fund could be established to fund various dissemination activities including awareness raising education of users training of retailers etc the fund could be set up as a collaborative effort by members of the ppp if necessary the governing council or project management unit with the help of the financing subgroup could establish a task force to institute the revolving fund the initial seeding for the revolving fund could be provided by nationalized and commercial banks and the various stakeholders could take out loans for dissemination activities stakeholders should be required to be members of the partnership network in order to take out a loan revolving fund could also play an important role for cdm no financing or cers from cdm are received for the first year after registration the revolving fund could fill this gap and finance activities such as monitoring and evaluation once cdm funding comes in after the first year the revolving fund can be paid should not be expected that the revolving fund will receive much return in the beginning it may take some time for the improved cookstove industry to mature and for manufacturers and retailers to accrue enough profit to pay back the revolving monitoring and is desirable to distinguish between monitoring and evaluation of the programme as a whole and that of individual constituents in particular the monitoring of the contest the activities the testing aspects dissemination of the stoves in any region the fuel supply each of these components would require of every project at a very close level the kind of monitoring required would also vary from component to component for example the progress of activities would be gauged through presentations and consultations and through visit of these facilities however the success of dissemination activities can be gauged essentially through field visits and field level monitoring in view of this it is important that parameters required for monitoring the individual constituents as well as the programme as a whole be clearly identified by the steering committee and the advisory group subsequently monitoring teams can be identified at various levels and the periodicity of monitoring of every component and the programme can also be decided also has to be recognized that finally the success of the programme should be visible in greater usage of the stoves and in positive health impacts so the field level monitoring would form a very crucial part of the overall monitoring exercise in this context some recent developments have made the process easier as given microchip and personal computer revolutions are offering ways to monitor and evaluate programs covering millions of households such small smart fast and cheap monitoring is crucial for modifying programs to optimize effectiveness as well as demonstrating benefits to funders such devices include an inexpensive particle and temperature monitor based on smoke alarm technology pats which is used to monitor indoor air pollution levels before and after introduction of improved stoves and an monitor tams which is used to document behavior for example changes in cooking patterns when improved stoves are introduced for introductions of stove the most promising device is the monitoring system sums that measures and records stove usage with a small datalogging temperature monitor which is now being linked to cell phone networks not only does the sums allow verification of usage but it also facilitates understanding of adoption patterns eg what kind of households are more likely to adopt which not and why in addition by providing a measure of monthly usage it makes possible the application of conditional cash transfer methods to promote effective roles of the major order to effectively fulfill the above requirements of a cook stove initiative each stakeholder must understand its role in the program the major stakeholders are ministry of new and renewable energy mnre manufacturers retailers marketing company financial institutions and local ngos the potential roles for the stakeholders are summarized in table ministry of new and renewable energy the government ministry taking the lead on improved cook stove dissemination the ministry of new and renewable energy mnre must initiate and regulate the cook stove program by playing a catalyzing role and putting in place mechanisms that would facilitate the progress necessary tasks include establishing a common vision for the stakeholders setting chulha performance standards facilitating marketing and education selecting targeted areas implementing financial mechanisms such as incentives or subsidies and creating a framework for monitoring and evaluation the catalyst of the ppp mnre needs to establish a common vision with shared objectives for all the stakeholders to follow if shared objectives are not established the cook stove initiative may not be carried out as effectively in order to avoid these issues each stakeholder must have the same understanding of the program goals even though each may have its own additional objectives for instance a manufacturing company may have its own goal to beat out the competition as the number one stove mnre must publicize the mission to the stakeholders through press releases newsletters documents on its website and to known stakeholders communication between mnre and the stakeholders is essential in determining and working together toward these objectives this communication can be carried out through a partnership which is discussed earlier in this roles of stakeholders in a new improved chulha a common vision for all cook stove performance standards and testing marketing and targeted financial a framework for monitoring and affordable stoves that reduce fuel consumption smoke and cooking and development that focuses on cooking distribution channels or take advantage of existing technical training programs for retailers and mnre procedures to seek out tests to determine if stoves meet performance improved chulhas to village stoves through demonstrations in users on proper operation and and service stoves that do not function loans to business and accounting training to manufacturers in assessment of cooking village training to in marketing and demonstrations in order to ensure quality of the stoves mnre must set and enforce chulha performance standards and testing procedures for a stove to qualify for the program it should meet certain fuel consumption and emissions must facilitate demand generation for market development through a vast awareness mnre may be able to provide funds for the publicity and hire a marketing company to execute a mass media campaign television radio print furthermore through the ppp mnre may be able to arrange with other government agencies to grant the marketers access to government channels in order to extend the reach of awareness efforts see recommendations for a mass awareness and promotional campaign a more detailed section on marketing new cook stove initiative should start with targeted communities that are best prepared to carry out a successful cook stove program these targeted areas can serve as pilot programs and the steering committee and regional subcommittees with the leadership of mnre should select these communities based on the criteria mentioned above in key elements of improved chulha dissemination see recommendations for initial focus of the delivery programme above for more details on selecting targeted should put into place a series of financial incentives for manufacturers that would promote research and development and mass production subsidies for the user a variety of options are given in recommendations for financial arrangements for delivery above and mnre should choose which financial mechanisms to implement from among these options loans are the most important means to enable poor consumers to purchase improved chulhas so mnre should establish links with financial institutions including commercial banks nationalized banks and microfinance institutions that operate in each state mnre and these financial institutions can work together through the partnership as discussed in section mnre could create a framework for monitoring and evaluation of the cook stove initiative to ensure that stakeholders are effectively fulfilling their roles and those stoves are actually being adopted and used however an uninvolved third party should carry out the evaluations primary role is to produce affordable stoves that reduce fuel consumption emissions and cooking time as part of the research and development the manufacturers should assess the cooking needs of various communities so that they can design appropriate stoves users are more concerned with cooking time and fuel consumption than with health therefore when designing the fuel inputs manufacturers should consider the time constraints and be careful not to add any work some stoves such as those used in improved cook stove program may require women to cut pieces of fuelwood into small pieces however this may be and some women may not have the appropriate tools in kenya many women did not adopt these stoves because of the additional manufacturers must also distribute and sell the stoves to the retailers distribution strategies will vary depending on who the retailers are see the section retailers above but the manufacturers either need to create new distribution channels or take advantage of existing addition to producing and distributing stoves the manufacturers should create training programs they should provide the retailers with installation operation maintenance and servicing training they should also train the retailers to carry out technical demonstrations in villages and to give operation and maintenance education to the users if the manufacturers themselves do not train the retailers local ngos might in some cases then they should train the testing agencies would carry out the tests required to determine if a stove meets the performance standards for the improved cook stove initiative they would need to seek accreditation from mnre and follow the necessary procedures set by mnre this has been detailed in section retailers job is to sell the improved chulhas to village households in order to keep the retailer motivated the stoves must be sold at a profitable yet affordable price once the stoves are sold the retailers should educate the users on proper operation and maintenance of the stoves also the retailers should repair and service stoves that stop functioning the retailers are motivated to earn profits they should be involved in marketing the chulhas in the villages in which they conduct their businesses the retailers as part of their marketing schemes should carry out demonstrations of the technology in the villages perhaps with the assistance of the manufacturing company a local ngo furthermore the retailers should encourage advertising among the are multiple options for who the retailers could be many programs have utilized the village entrepreneur model to varying degrees of success see discussions in appendix as aforementioned in key elements these entrepreneurs can be individual women hereditary potters who have traditionally sold stoves or groups of women working together existing small shops could start selling the stoves a network of dealers could combine various types of entrepreneurs and shops addition to or instead of creating new delivery networks an improved chulha initiative may be able to take advantage of networks and move forward by collaborating with some programs that have already created dissemination channels such programs include hindustan lever project shakti and global on handwashing with soap and agricultural retail chains such as hariyali kisaan bazaar and tata kisan sansar all of these are described in appendix more details about how strategies from these initiatives described in appendix e can be applied to a cook stove program see recommendations for grassroots value chain for stove delivery above financial institutions such as banks and microfinance institutions mfis should provide financial assistance to consumers who cannot afford to purchase the stoves on their own from the perspective it is the institutions that will be the most critical for taking the cook stove initiative forward see recommendations for financial arrangements for delivery above for more financial institutions might also be able to give business and accounting training to the retailers at the village level if they do not give the training directly to the retailers they might be able to provide local ngos or other entity with training materials so that another player could train the retailers local ngos might be able to provide valuable insights into the socioeconomic dynamics of the villages in which they work established ngos may be respected and trusted by the villagers thus they may have greater capacity to work more closely with villagers to disseminate improved cook manufacturers carry out an assessment of cooking needs local ngos may be able to assist in the surveys if the entrepreneur model is employed local ngos can identify groups or select individuals who show the drive and ability to successfully sell the stoves the ngos with the help of the manufacturers for technical knowledge and financial institutions for business knowledge may be able to provide training to these retailers moreover local ngos can perhaps assist in marketing and facilitate or participate in demonstrations in villages the capabilities of ngos vary widely while some ngos may be able to successfully execute the aforementioned tasks some might already have too much work to accomplish and others simply might not possess the necessary skills and tools collaboration with local ngos should certainly be explored but it may not always be possible or mnre and the ppp decide to pursue cdm and carbon trading the steering committee with the help of the advisory financing subgroup could put together a task force to calculate the potential carbon savings prove additionality and apply to the designated national authority and cdm executive board for approval and registration the money earned from selling carbon emissions reduction certificates could be used to fund any combination of the aforementioned financial summary of recommendations this section the major recommendations made in the earlier section have been summarized for ready global suggest an approach to develop the appropriate technology we also recommend that this prize be central focus on cleaner and efficient combustion is required in order to achieve the health and social gains that are the primary motivator for this the basic technical performance specifications for the cookstove prize should be based on four key parameters carbon monoxide co particulate matter pm efficiency and black carbon additionally have to consider cost and as additional the complexities of the prize design process partnering with the right organization to develop the prize is absolutely critical this organization must have both expertise in developing such prizes and has a global technical is a need for a coordinated project to review and revise the standards and testing protocols for cookstoves with international consultation in the meantime an interim modification to the bis standard is recommended so as to enable one of the latest protocols available internationally should be adapted and used in the testing centres recommended in this report as an interim development of standards for certification should be linked to health impacts of the stove with a given performance the certification can be in the form of as is being done for various energy devices by testing protocols can consider generation of performance characteristics for a stove relating thermal performance and emissions to the burn types of testing centres are recommended to be set up as part of the new initiative i in laboratories for cookstoves ii certification facilities run by independent organizations iii field testing facilities with grassroot level ngos order to do research on the fundamental scientific principles underlying the design and operation of cookstoves it is recommended that coordinated projects involving research groups across the country should be funded some of these groups could graduate into centres for stoves on the basis of their of new products requires interdisciplinary groups enabling linkages between technical experts the users the field workers understanding the needs of the users and also the manufacturers so as to incorporate several essential inputs at the product design stage order to help stove developers in conducting fundamental analysis of the new designs technical consultancy centres possibly linked to any of the centres could be set up to operate in commercial consultancy mode up of centres recommended above as well as funding of projects should be carried out only through open request for proposals evaluated by an advisory delivery an improved cook stove initiative to be sustainable commercialization must be encouraged market development is in turn integral to promoting commercialization a widespread awareness campaign that leverages all forms of media on a massive scale various government channels such as schools and health and social services institutions village demonstrations and advertising among village families and is branded with a recognizable logo and celebrity endorsements would be the best strategy to develop the improved cook stove market a technology is adopted for wide dissemination its assessment and certification must be carried out the certification which is expected to be based on rigorous lab level tests could be the basis of technology selection for pilot level programmes the technology selection for wider dissemination should be based on evaluation of the pilot level programmes the performance of the technology selected must be above a minimum threshold as decided at the appropriate ensure effectiveness in the initial stages of the program it should be carried out in the regions first these targeted areas should be selected based on a variety of strengths including the presence of financial institutions biomass availability managerial and technical readiness determined by past and ongoing successful cookstove dissemination projects and delivery channels maharashtra tamil nadu and karnataka meet these order to reach as many households as effectively and efficiently as possible an extensive network of various types of dealers must be utilized this network could include entrepreneurs and shop owners rather than solely create new delivery networks it may be more efficient to take advantage of existing value chains as well these value chains could be leveraged through collaboration with existing programs such as project shakti and others agricultural retail chains such as hariyali kisaan bazaar and tata kisan sansar and petty the perspective financing an improved cook stove is the greatest challenge there are two options for user subsidies no direct subsidy or a continually decreasing subsidy for the equivalent expenditure on the current annual lpg subsidy cook stoves can be disseminated to every household in rural india under various subsidy households that cannot afford to purchase a stove even after subsidies should be able to receive loans mnre should establish linkages with institutions that can provide these loans such as nationalized banks commercial banks and microfinance institutions additionally as loans often have steep interest rates and many borrowers may not be able to afford the interest interest payments could be partially or fully financial assistance should be linked with the performance of the technology as well as the affordability level of the order to encourage production mnre could offer a advance subsidy or a production tax credit to receive an advance subsidy payment a manufacturer must increase production of cook stoves by a certain percentage under a production tax credit scheme for every certain number of stoves produced a manufacturing company could receive a certain amount of tax credit or choose to take a grant of up to a certain percentage of the manufacturing property value revolving fund could finance other dissemination activities such as awareness raising education of users training of retailers etc the initial seeding for the revolving fund could be provided by nationalized and commercial banks or mnre and various stakeholders which should be members of the partnership could take out loans for dissemination clean development mechanism cdm and carbon credits should be considered for funding the initiative the potential fuelwood and carbon emission savings should qualify cook stove initiative for cdm funding the money earned from selling carbon emissions reduction certificates could be used to fund any combination of the aforementioned activities or financial incentives furthermore carbon credits would encourage private sector participation if manufacturers have the rights to the carbon credits they could use these credits to minimize the retail cost of their stoves fuel cookstoves programme must have a dual thrust on technological improvement in stoves as well as establishment of an assured fuel supply chain the latter is critical to dissemination of devices with rural household has an immense variety of biomass residues transforming them into processed fuels for use with improved cookstoves is crucial to extracting the best performance combustion efficiency and reduced emissions from this initiative pelletizing will be more suitable than briquetting whose size and cost constrains its use in household extensive study on the availability of biomass residues surveying type quantity seasonal variations costs and suitability for pelletization is required as existing data is quite is required for the development of biomass pelletizing machines for production of fuel pellets from available suitable for decentralized operation with a capacity of and with low electricity requirement besides standards need to be evolved for such machinery the research and development of an efficient and improved closed loop decentralized charcoal making unit operating on agricultural residues is field deployment and testing of these fuel processing units in varied regions will allow a detailed assessment of their performance involving the local community in the various operational aspects of the biomass processing unit will integrate and embed this initiative deep into the context of the field energy environment also offering immense possibilities for fostering participation and community stoves differ from domestic units in being used in community and commercial environments where multiple meals for a much larger number of people are prepared with a greater frequency deployed in restaurants hostels places of worship and ashrams caterers and suppliers of meals their constituency of users and the scale and intensity of resource use implies that different dissemination trategies pitching convenience and fuel savings must be identified for different numerous community stove designs exist with large variations in the operation and type of fuel used protocols to test these devices on a common platform are lacking and must be prioritized up of facilities for the certification of designs and devices and the for these stoves should be coupled with the facilities being planned for the domestic stoves the development of high performance community stoves can particularly benefit from the technical support centres which are recommended for the domestic stoves and implementing the decentralized fuel supply chain will be a crucial aspect of the community cookstoves program and given the significantly larger scale at which these units function it may be easier to accomplish this for community stoves than similarly focused initiatives for the domestic survey conducted by feedback consulting services pvt ltd which examined the practices at schools in villages and suburban areas reported that nearly all schools visited use locally made stoves similar to a three stone fire majority of those polled indicated a willingness to shift to an improved cookstove but would need government support to enable the strategies beginning with pilot programmes must take fuel and food types into account map markets current unexplored by manufacturers focus on extended and extensive testing and have integral monitoring and evaluation components all of these especially will be crucial for the strategy the success of this initiative depends programme the activities and programs emerging from the national biomass cookstoves initiative in the partnership model at all levels will ensure that participants government organizations industry academic and social sector entities can leverage each expertise and is suggested that to catalyze the nbci the ministry of new and renewable energy in its facilitating capacity initiate and mobilize a steering committee assisted by an administrative support members of the steering committee apart from government administrators must include independent consultants who can be paid for coordinating the entire initiative the steering committee can draw on the counsel of the advisory board whose constituents will be financing technical sales and distribution and monitoring and evaluation should be disseminated by regional committees which will lead activities in the eight physiographic regions of india reflecting prevailing patterns of biomass availability and cooking practices across the country committees can be constituted with a mechanism one from the public sector and one of the private sector should engage in ppps identify dissemination strategies collaborations opportunities and issues and report to the steering committee they can also facilitate the network of partnership members for dialogue and collaboration amongst stakeholders involved in the cookstoves is required from various government ministries industry sources for the awards competition technical testing protocols and facilities dissemination training electronic print and contact publicity and and evaluation a central aspect of the initiative needs to be instrumental at every stage from the awards contest and testing to fuel supply and dissemination it should occur through and especially through field visits and in this project are identified as the government of india ministry of new and renewable energy manufacturers testing agencies retailers financial institutions local ngos academic and research groups and the each playing a distinct role which must be clarified right in the proposed scheduling of the the above sections present the recommendations individually for each component of the programme needless to say they all have to be dovetailed together in a logical sequence from that perspective it is suggested that the activities identified above be carried out in two phases phase i comprising of the tasks which need to be started immediately so as to prepare the ground for the long term activities to be undertaken in phase ii it is also presumed that the activities related to community stoves would be carried out separately from those for domestic stoves thus the scheduling of activities for the two types of stoves is given activities for domestic phase should start with setting up a partnership through a governing council a ceo for the initiative and a project management unit subsequently the task for setting up interim protocols must be taken up followed by selection of available stove designs and identification of regions for pilot dissemination there need to be a few pilot programmes to experiment with different delivery models detailed information from the entrepreneurs already in the field about their experiences must be obtained prior to this task so as to plan more effective pilots monitoring and evaluation of the pilots would also need to be done the above the steps required to launch a contest need to be taken up in this phase the ground work for setting up testing facilities and centres must also start in this phase on fuel front efforts should be made to identify small scale pelletising technologies already available these must be tested in the field and improved upon with the help of technical experts so as to make them suitable for wider dissemination this task needs to be taken up on a priority basis so that stoves which need processed fuel can be also be used for pilot dissemination summary of tasks recommended to be carried out in phase i is given below set of activities must precede the activities listed in b and of the partnership ppp by an initiating agency comprising of a network of stakeholders and led by a governing council up a project management unit pmu with a ceo an administrative support group and an advisory board up regional linkages for project implementation by the project management up linkages with various ministries funding agencies private partners so as to mobilize funds for various activities these activities are required to be carried out in a certain sequence so as to lead to pilot dissemination modifications in the bis testing protocol in quick consultation with the stoves of stove designs for pilot dissemination in selected regions with the help of modified testing of regions suitable for pilot study and conducting baseline surveys for energy consumption with traditional dissemination strategies for different regions viz direct or indirect subsidies modes of creating user awareness and linkages with banks and mfis establish revolving out awareness campaigns and village of stoves through collaborative supply appropriate pelletizing technology available in the country which could be disseminated directly or could be quickly upgraded field testing of the technology and its upgradation with the help of technical expertise if required dissemination of these machines along with the pilot dissemination of stoves as suggested above to use different local agency for and evaluation of the pilot this set of activities are required for the innovation initiating the process of prize design with a launching the evaluation of the entries at the end of the contest these activities are required to be taken up in the first phase as a first step leading to the phase ii of the programme for long term initiating the process of developing testing protocols and standards for long term applicability call for eois for setting up the different testing call for eois for setting up consortia to do research related to stoves and development of new call for eois to set up technical consultancy centres to help stove designers for improving their survey of biomass availability present level utilization cost etc for selected regions in the by the time this phase starts it is expected that new protocols would have been identified and hence the testing centres initiated in the first phase can get into full operation centres with testing facilities can start regular training of personnel from the commercial testing centres as well as field testing centres the certification centres can carry out the testing in accordance with standards with the services of the field testing centres would be required for evaluating the performance of the improved stoves in the field after a pilot programme first and later as part of any full scale dissemination the formation of consortia the research activities can be funded and would continue into phase ii while giving valuable inputs in the development of new stove designs by the technical is also recognized that there are many stove manufacturers who can develop potentially good stove designs intuitively but they would need technical support to improve upon their designs in order to help stove developers in conducting fundamental analysis of the new designs technical consultancy centres possibly linked to any of the centres could be facilitated to operate in commercial consultancy mode this aspect is particularly important to address some of the specific regional cooking needs strategies for large scale on regular design and development of new pelletizing machines and charcoal development and setting up commercially viable fuel processing units and supply operation monitoring and upgradation as per community i different user segments and regions for pilot dissemination along with strategies for pilot of field working in identified regions for implementation of pilot an agency for monitoring and evaluation of pilot of baseline data with traditional stoves in the identified sites with the help of field monitoring selection of suitable stove designs by implementing installation of stoves by the manufacturers with the help of implementing and evaluation in the field for at least two months by the monitoring suitable protocols and standards for community development of better designs using technical knowhow potential interaction to enable commercial mode of operation and evaluation of the programme by an independent new cook stove program must incorporate the lessons learned from the successes and failures of past and ongoing dissemination programs these lessons demonstrate that the key elements of an effective cook stove initiative include technology research and development performance standards demand generation mass production and distribution channels selection and training of retailers financing education of users cook stove servicing and evaluation the roles of the stakeholders must be specified and clarified perhaps as suggested earlier so that they can successfully work together to achieve these key elements of success in order to penetrate the rural markets as much as possible opportunities for collaboration to take advantage of existing dissemination networks should be explored with these factors taken into consideration a new improved chulha initiative can be

launching a new initiative on biomass cookstoves with the primary aim of enhancing the availability of clean and efficient energy for the energy deficient and poorer sections of our society large section of our population of the rural households and of the urban households according to the national sample st survey still uses biomass for its cooking needs an estimated of the residential energy in india comes from biomass much of it burnt in traditional chulhas the adverse health and implications of this form of energy supply are enormous with women and children at particular risk the burden of biomass fuel collection and processing for cooking also falls mainly upon women and children mainly girls who spend significant time gathering fuel resources every day providing a clean cooking energy option for these households will yield enormous gains in terms of health and welfare of the weakest and the most vulnerable sections of society at the same time the cleaner combustion in these devices will greatly reduce the products of incomplete combustion which are greenhouse pollutants thus helping combat climate change initiative of mnre is envisaged to be structured differently from the earlier national programme on improved chulhas although it will build on the several successes of that programme while also drawing lessons from the experience gained from its starting point of the current exercise is the user the solution on offer should first and foremost be easy to use and maintain and conform to local cooking habits across the country its adoption must make economic sense to the household the programme is conceived not as a handout to poorer households but rather as an economically sustainable business solution as the prime minister of india has often said we need to make the poor of this country new initiative is also based on the recognition that that cookstoves technology has improved considerably in the past few years but further advances are still possible and indeed essential our aim is to achieve quality of energy services from cookstoves comparable to that from other clean energy sources such as lpg has held several brainstorming sessions and consultations over the past few months with a range of stakeholders and experts from civil society academia business and government to develop an understanding of current activities and future potential of such a programme the prime office has been closely associated with these deliberations this initiative a series of projects are envisaged using several existing and better cookstoves and different grades of processed biomass fuels this will help in exploring a range of technology deployment biomass processing and delivery models leveraging partnerships the same time it will set in motion a series of activities that are designed to develop the of household cookstoves technologies and deployment models this may include an innovative global contest to develop combustion units with high thermal efficiency and low pollution characteristics and in parallel appropriate devices the initiative will aim for a significant enhancement of technical capacity in the country by setting up testing certification and monitoring facilities and strengthening programmes in key technical institutions an independent monitoring and evaluation component is envisaged to assess the activities and them on an ongoing basis and last but not the least it will welcome and promote participation by civil society and private actors to make it a true also believes that the technologies and delivery models that will be developed through this initiative will be useful for other developing countries in asia africa and latin america whose populations also suffer from health and other problems related to biomass use in household cooking therefore success of this initiative could well have a transformative impact not only for our own citizens but also for the energy poor in other developing

monitoring and evaluation ongoing activity by ethos engineers in technical and humanitarian opportunities of service is attempting to evaluate existing methods and develop methods with greater replicability and accessibility we need to examine the proposed protocols and suggest changes specific to stoves or cooking procedures in the indian region i serve on the technical committee and will be happy to coordinate with indian colleagues in regard to this task the resulting methodologies could form the basis of monitoring and evaluation methods adopted within this program httpaddr please see attached presentation by prof tami bond of university of illinois urbana high level of customization of technologies is needed based on at the product design product development and product use stages to create channels of communication from the user to the designer a stove laboratory model has been proposed bond jan attached presentation i university company based design lab understand fundamentals of combustion relevant to stove design ii stove testing and certification lab evaluate performance user satisfaction etc among different stove designs and iii testing lab confirm improvements in field feedback into the design this should be considered in the present is need for training programmes for capacity building in understanding and use of monitoring and evaluation methods these would need to be directed to stove testing and certification labs and monitoring groups and other relevant stake standards need to be linked to market segments and the of the technology technology that serves the upper market segments must necessarily meet stringent performance standards while technology that could serve bpl segment could have some relaxation in performance solid biomass development for densification of leafy straw biomass for a variety of abet for low technology must be explored for decentralized applications delivery and distribution models fiscal incentives and regard to carbon finance for monetization of carbon emissions reduction methodologies need to be developed for the voluntary carbon market and cdm market for efficiency of renewable biomass for thermal these should include reductions in all kyoto gas emissions from combustion co and development of realistic monitoring and validation methodologies for carbon emissions reduction are needed should be explored for gaining credit for reduction of greenhouse pollutants co nmhcs and black international black carbon funds should be explored models should focus on distributed benefits at the user and the rural employment enterprise assistance should be provided to smaller groups for seeking international patents to protect indigenous knowledge eg materials design ideas of standards monitoring and evaluation methods to work with the government of india international partners and indian colleagues to develop product and certification d combustion and emissions stove design participation in a experimental facility towards a more fundamental understanding of biomass combustion and emissions especially in regard to aerosols preferably in a two or partnership between an iit private company and and distribution models fiscal incentives and financing provide science inputs to policy research to establish and monetize climate of abets for approach to finding the elusive question is the best stove kar teri new delhi researchers we often design a stove with focus on aspects which we believe is important for example rarely does aesthetics or ability to cook local food get importance at product development stage though these aspects are often critical in determining user acceptance to new stove design however the target of the scientific community must be to make a product which is not only technically superior multi feed stock compatible high combustion low emission model cook stove but a stove which is voluntarily accepted by community past experiences suggest that if this approach is not adhered to the community will shun a product ultimately as the goal is replacement of polluting low energy efficient cooking technologies which are not possible if the users reject technologically better the approach given below will help if identifying the most suitable cook stove as close to ideal as possible and provide inputs for further is a saying that after every km there is change in food and fuel pattern in india hence for such a diverse country it is imperative that rather than rolling out a uniform product cook stove customization is carried out prior to large scale adoption and diffusion efforts for strategic reasons it is proposed that a block is chosen as the smallest unit for dissemination planning and execution for each block the major social groups need to be identified care should be taken to ensure that minority groups are not left out of considerations then to promote fair competition all manufacturers are asked to come out with a product which they think will be best suited for the population residing in the block these products must already be certified by designated agencies after laboratory testing to have minimum efficiency and emission parameters as decided by the government once these products are submitted for field trial one reputed agency can be asked to conduct field trials for these stoves in a circular basis as each selected household will be provided all the product prototypes in a rotating fashion we avoid any bias in the study user feedback will be measured in a quantitative manner for a scientifically valid and neutral comparison amongst various models us define cook stove utility mathematically from the point of all the aspects detailed below the user will be requested to respond in the following manner point for each response is also better compared to traditional stove compared to traditional stove difference compared to traditional stove compared to traditional stove worse compared to traditional stove performance aspects which historically have been critical from point of view are not necessarily in same order of of of to cook local in taste of maintenance service and repair of smoke and during baseline survey additional performance aspect is highlighted by community the same can be added in the above list need to categorize the performance aspects into three categories namely critical very important and important if any stove gets in any critical aspect or two in any critical aspect from majority of users then the stove is rejected after field trials similarly during field trial phase it is important to identify user priorities and focus on dissemination of stoves which surpass the minimum performance expectation of users how to establish a fair quantitative cut off bench mark is a research question which needs further deliberations for the time being that there is no addition or reduction in the list of performance aspects mentioned above the maximum utility of a stove let us call it as the ideal stove can be however the general trend of production is that a product with overall higher utility is available at higher price this gives rise to an argument that better the product lesser will be its penetration amongst the after user feedback based field trial the most preferred cookstove with best user rating would be selected and disseminated the of that cook stove will be provided with the negative attributes as pointed out by the user community and will be asked to further customize if necessary once the customized model is ready government should come forward and provide targeted subsidy to make it available for the entire population of the block after all as suggested by the planning commission of india it is the solemn responsibility to provide affordable lifeline clean energy to the poorest of the poor s rural technology formerly rrl of technical unit for npic to was an important national programme under point programme of govt of india many scientific players have contributed a vast knowledge developments during to under npic as per needs of common people of rural india the ics were developed and it was successful even among poorest of poor thermal engineering was well considered in design developments of previous ics to obtain conservation of green fuels and reduction of pollutions most important aspects of last programme of fuels available its successful use in ics to get desired acceptability of ics by the users for long term cost durable understanding of ics by the of ics through out of the my view the present interested scientific players should review the past scientific works on development of india before commenting for any new some presentations suggestions made by premier institutions in last meeting were just repeating old theories of improved chulha programme however those were important for success of any national energy programme my suggestions are given for new new designs can be successful sustainable in indian scenario when it will be tested in field in different conditions for a considerable period all old models have been well tested at least for a decade therefore all existing successful designs should be scientifically reviewed by impartial scientific team and drawback if any should be eliminated it should be further developed if design with different concepts for indian requirement may be developed by dedicated development for evaluation of performance and emission of improved were well developed earlier which were equal to european standards however it can be modified if necessary as per processing its cost and was well tested during npic that those ics require for processing of fuels for combustion were miserably failed during propagation since indian rural users never accept the conditions to size the wood pieces in to mm diameter and mm length villagers will not pay any extra amount for sizing the fuels unless fuels are not available in their vicinity for daily cooking of of small sized fuels after sizing may cost more it can be applicable in area of improved chulhas and financing was well known during npic that use of ics was reduced drastically in villages when govt subsidy was withdrawn and cost ics was of should be affordable may be within to to obtain sustainability among all class of society in rural sector it should be noted that many middle class rural users even in interior part of north east have shifted from woody biomass to lpg gas for clean burning availability etc most of poor rural people and people having enough free fuels can go for wood burning for cooking now a incentives monitoring and the quality and evaluation of ics was failed during last part of npic due to its vast area of operation in the country the improved stoves should be foolproof models made centrally by few designated industries and durable then quality can be to users will certainly help adoption of in rural would like to work in the area of and standardisation of improved cook stoves at shyam envoy prime think we need to focus our efforts in the working groups on the following or elements to avoid repeating disappointments of the the technology side there are two components to design the most efficient sturdy and durable easy to use and safe combustion device to develop the most efficient and processing for a variety of available the more versatile the better the groups should come out very specific and precise benchmarks for both these technology objectives these include technical as well as economic in terms of need to have people focus also on product design once the basic technology is available how do we design a product around it to suit different user requirements and market conditions this is important in a country as diverse as india it will apply to the combustion device as well as to fuel processing eg whether in form of briquettes or pellets or compacted meeting the requirement of easy storage convenient use and final disposal of will need to start talking about an effective business plan to launch and sustain the product there may be need for focused awareness campaigns in different languages there will have to be demonstration campaigns and targeted advertising the plan may require product trials in the field and include study of feedback and possible adjustments in product design we could request assistance from our iims or the isb i can talk to until the initiative reaches the stage of growth we would need a monitoring and evaluation process under the have seen the earlier guidelines and benchmarks you had sent in the light of the results of the work of the groups these will have to be revised and this is very important we must ensure quality this time round as i said at our meeting we need high and sophisticated technology here not low or intermediate a k and of renewable energy of technology and pratap university of agriculture rajasthan reference to your letter regarding the above mentioned subject this is to kindly inform you that the bdtc udaipur has been working for the popularization of improved cookstove technology since a long time we have been working in the field of design development improvement testing installation and dissemination of technology of improved cookstove since a long time i would like to be involved in the following areas d and technology processing its cost and other relevant field if of renewable energy sources college of technology and engineering is actively engaged in teaching research development activities related to new and renewable energy sources viz bioenergy biogas and biomass and improved cookstoves the activities of renewable energy sources in the centre were initiated in april with sponsored project on utilization of renewable energy in agriculture technical back support unit on improved chulha was added in in the department the centre attained national recognition in the field of improved chulha and bio energy d and technology new models of chulha sukhad rajavikas heena aravali and single pot udai mohini developed at the centre received appreciation and commendation at various levels department has also developed a metallic sigri namely for domestic cooking need this sigri can accommodate small wooden twigs briquetted fuel and small pellets for meeting cooking energy requirement for an average sized family the thermal efficiency of this cookstoves is with briquetted fuel durable cookstoves chetak and udairaj were developed and installed at number of support unit organized many training programmes for rural women in rajasthan and other states the rural artisans are trained in construction and maintenance of chulha they are paid rs for each chulha constructed thus this becomes a self employment opportunity for the rural pot udairaj pot chetak monitoring and feed back of chulha is a regular feature of the centre so far more than feedback have been conducted in rajasthan mp maharashtra and andhra pradesh this helps in qualitative and quantitative control on the working of chulhas large size community chulhas have been constructed in institutions hostels and industries such as sadhana chemicals madri and manaria dairy farm udaipur downdraft gasifier stove which was designed in department consists of reactor grate ash removal primary air controller flap pot support and secondary air opening the capacity of the stove was kw and thermal efficiency was was noticed that improved cookstoves based on semi gasifier principle have better thermal efficiency and less emission improved cookstoves have been tested and their thermal efficiency and emissions were determined on the basis of water boiling and evaporation test chapati baking test as developed by the ministry recently two improved cookstoves namely navagni and philips biomass cookstoves were tested it was felt that testing standards for the performance evaluation of improved cookstoves should be developed considering the recent development carried out in the processing its cost and department has developed a densification machine yielding briquettes of required size according to need the densified material can be converted into cubes and pallets hard operated cycle operated and electric power operated briquetting machine of varying capacity running on principle of extruder has been designed and developed this machine has been tested for binding loose biomass and char powder observed that charcoal mixed with dung slurry in equal quantity given maximum efficiency of where as briquetting efficiency of charcoal plus clay mixture found to be a package of practice for proper utilization of prosopis juliflora coupled with charcoaling and briquetting process has been developed metallic kiln equipped with required provision for process of charcoaling and sufficient for kg of prosopis juliflora has been designed and developed it consists of two interlocking cylindrical and conical cover the cover is provided with the equally spaced steam release ports which can be closed with plugs when required the kiln is m in dia and m high and has a capacity of approximately cum the efficiency of developed kiln was observed as is a good scope of the densified fuels in the cooking stoves and different loose biomass waste materials can be utilized in place of fire wood improved methods for char production can be other relevant field if deptt has developed germplasm for fuel wood tree species of semi arid region of aravalli in the rajasthan and various agro technologies for improvement of hydrocarbon rich plant species for arid semi arid regions of rajasthan package of practice was developed for utilization of barren land for energy use through energy plantation programme research work on new species of energy plantation can be carried for the better production of fire and training may also be organized covering present state of art recent advances and future prospectus of different renewable energy for the identification of improved chulhas for the states of bihar jharkhand orissa chhatisgarh and uttar dr karabi understand that chulhas need to be identified for the above mentioned states from volume december but since i am not familiar with these stoves i am not in a position to offer these stoves were designed and developed under the npic program they have been tested in the simulated kitchen or laboratory for the ratio of the whole mixture of the combustion particulate matter spm value of efficiency of stove using the bis time with lid on surface suggestion would be to test the selected stoves further respirable particulate matter and carbon monoxide co emissions from stoves in the kitchen and adjoining rooms over a period of hours to understand the actual emission characteristics of the stove under actual field conditions this test may be conducted in number of representative households where this stoves will be introduced being the statistically calculated value from the total number of households where the stoves will be introduced water boiling test with litre water using the uc berkeley method for stove performance at high power both under cold start conditions and hot start low power simmer conditions and find out to boil without fuel specific down these above mentioned tests may be conducted both in the field and also in the simulated kitchen to understand the effect of these stoves on the indoor air quality iaq of the households and stove performance under field conditions when local fuels are used till a national standard for indoor air quality is finalised a comparative before and after study for the status of the iaq and stove performance parameters with traditional and improved stove is important to understand the improvement tests along with tests for stove safety stability surface temperature etc and day home placement test will provide good information about the acceptability and suitability of these stoves for the target households innovation contest for ambuj institute of technology recent years there has been much attention paid to the idea of as a way to induce the development of technology in neglected areas specifically this refers to grand to stimulate or technology prizes should be viewed as a potential complement to and not a substitute for traditional funding for research and innovation activities inducement prizes do offer several advantages including a broader spectrum of ideas and participants by reducing the barriers to a goal to be achieved without having to decide which is best way to meet that much of the risk to the participants since the award of the prize is contingent of the contest parameters being met capacity of prizes for educating inspiring and even mobilizing the additional resources from firms and other order to be successful though it is important to design the context carefully both in terms of defining the parameters of participation and the goal to be achieved furthermore if the ultimate aim is to commercialize the technology then some thought must also be given to the buyer commitment of market creating strategy global innovation challenge for cookstoves will be very useful in that it will stimulate technical experts worldwide to focus on what so far has been only a niche activity for this community by entraining new technology developers into this arena we hopefully should be able to achieve a quantum jump in performance as well as increased competition but in order to do so we need to design the challenge key questions that will need to be examined are the desirable minimum but achievable technical performance characteristics of the of cookstoves ie power thermal efficiency emissions is are a suitable cost are other key characteristics such as should we segment the customer base ie what is the minimum number of technologies that would allow for a reasonable coverage of the target technologies also be part of the the challenge be a prize ie first past the post or a contest with minimum performance is a reasonable time frame for the contest as short as possible but long enough to allow technology developers to experiment with new on these aspects will be developed through consultations with various experts from within and outside the country including if needed a workshop in october which brings together these experts for finalizing these veena would like to emphasize that this opportunity comes in times where communication is much easier than in the s when the first initiative on cooking stoves was launched we are in a new era and hence the ideas and the methods should reflect this newness while developing options to replace an age old practice ie cooking with part global innovation the challenge customer base should be defined on the basis of food habits of an zone this could also be a parameter for the contestants to define the applicability of their stove subsequently this can be a criterion for selecting the my view a contest will promote more ideas to the months time frame from the entry into contest to final selection of the product designs seems technical include cooking practices as a th topic in the proposed ws on different technical delivery of sdc projects is to market irrigation systems for small and marginal farmers i would suggest that this project experience would be useful to look into while designing deployment strategies for new cooker rural network could also give us useful svati thought that i should put across my experiences in interacting with household stove users over the past two and a half decades in bullet points may provide some insights into what i have experienced as the thought process of the rural woman i have often asked women what they were looking for in an improved stove their preferences in order of priority in the regions where i visited limited fuel stress communicated as eye irritation and respiratory problems largely for the children around this preference was i think of relatively recent origin considering the awareness about harmful effects of smoke as a result of the npic cooking time vessels soot free operation more an issue in the case of portable stoves because they fear that the stove may topple while in vigorous they should not have to change their cooking habits or this has implication on the height of the stove some women showed me bruised wrists because of the stove height and the process of roti seemed to prefer a fixed stove over a portable stove in the kitchen they may be okay with a portable stove as the second stove in the same way as lpg stoves are used mud stoves were preferred women were open to cement stoves while mud stoves contributed to the grace and charm of the kitchen cement stoves were relatively maintenance free of course these women were not exposed to the conveniences of emerging stoves trend seems to be to shift to agro residues wherever and whenever possible largely to reduce the time spent in collecting fuel there also seems to be an evolving tradition among agricultural labour that the labour is allowed to take away the agro residue from the farms and plantations where they work it is not uncommon to see different types of fuel stacked outside a house and in the cattle shed so when women said they wanted a multi fuel stove they would mean stoves that can burn husk saw dust wood coconut waste etc is always a conflict within the family about smoke in the kitchen men preferred it to a limited extent because it kept their produce stored above the kitchen dry women who had suffered long years of smoke were very clear that they and more importantly their children should not be exposed to smoke is the preferred fuel but it is sparingly used always because of the high cost of fuel and very poor penetration of distribution network an lpg cylinder usually lasts for months and often the household has to take the cylinder to an exchange point as there is still a problem with the last mile connectivity is not preferred because of the problems in supply and more importantly the quality of the stove kerosene stoves are often in very poor shape and food cooked on bad kerosene stoves smells of kerosene which is a repulsive smell the aroma of a smoky wood fire is more acceptable there are peak seasons when stoves are sold from january to may is the best time for selling stoves stoves costing around rs would be very difficult to sell largely because the amount is too small for a stove loan from the shg and too high for a personal investment stoves costing rs may sell to a limited market only if the stove is an inspirational product looks and behaves like an lpg stove even then women would be embarrassed to tell their friends and neighbours that they paid such a high amount for a wood stove whereas it would be okay to pay the same cost for an lpg stove so issue of positioning of fuel efficient household stoves need to be addressed most households would be wary of the new single pan portable stoves of high efficiency that are invading the commercial market women would take some time to totally shift to a new stove by dismantling the conventional stove stoves that have components that need to be replaced would also not arouse consumer confidence stove dissemination programme would take off well in regions where time is valued a household would be more inclined to invest in a time saving stove when the women are engaged in say beedi rolling is commonly believed that an unsubsidized stove programme would not take off because men control the finances and the stove is a need but women from several regions in the south have informally told us that they can influence their husbands and family members but it takes time so stoves should be available for sale over long periods and not for a week in a village fair or some such session on improved chulhas some sangeeta of mechanical engineering iit the outset i would like to thank the mnre and all others for taking this initiative and giving us an opportunity to participate in the discussion on march i would like to offer my comments on the proceedings of that meeting i would like to put my comments in two categories technology and technology good who has been associated with design analysis of a chulha would agree that design of a chulha is not an easy task technically a chulha should have high efficiency and low emissions with the fuel available in the region long life and low maintenance requirements but at the same time it must also satisfy some other requirements like ease of operation compatibility with food habits and affordability by the target group to incorporate all in a single design is indeed a tall order in chulha design of a good chulha particularly becomes difficult many other modern products because there any methodologies in place for design of a chulha much of the designing is done in a hit and trial mode in view of some of us who have been involved in analysis of chulhas for some time this is largely due to lack of good technical inputs in the development of this technology if we want to design a heat exchanger we have a wide range of correlations available which are a result of high quality experimental and analytical research even an industrial burner using a gaseous fuel can be designed using empirical correlations however the chulha as a technical device has still not reached that level is because of this difficulty that npic saw a very wide range of designs most of them without a sound technical research backing with the immense pressure on the tbus to meet the targets only a cut and trial approach could be used with limited understanding of the complex coupling of the phenomena taking place in the chulha for range of the current scenario the emphasis on clean combustion the visions of some researchers and developments in the gasification technology have brought forth a variety of very promising stove designs thanks to these developments the biomass based cooking is getting a completely fresh outlook however it must be understood that in a country like india a single type of chulha cannot be the choice for everyone using biomass for cooking the currently available notwithstanding there is still a need for doing the required for bringing out with good technical performance which the user can choose from to suit her needs and her pocket also a single chulha may not give high performance in all applications like roti making simmering of milk etc moreover at times it may be important for the designer to compromise somewhat on the performance to provide a low cost and durable option to the user there is a need for a range of products which can meet the needs of different economic strata of the society as well as different geographical regions it is suggested that at least some groups involved in chulha come together share their strengths and come up with generic design methodologies and consequently several designs of improved chulhas which can meet the desired standards chulhas and private the view of some of us any intervention in the rural areas to improve their living standard must not be seen in isolation from their most fundamental need of income generation for majority of the rural populace the living standards are abysmally low primarily because they have the required source of income thus any intervention must be first seen as an opportunity of providing local employment through development of local entrepreneurs it is easy to see that improved chulha technology has a very good potential to contribute to the same think it has been rightly identified that a marked improvement in chulha performance is possible only with processed fuel broadly speaking there will be two kinds of fuel of woody fuel into smaller and pelletizing of loose of these can easily be carried out by local entrepreneurs small cutters as well as with small motors are available for chopping of long woody fuel into smaller pieces at the meeting in mnre it was mentioned by the bp representative that the pellets prepared by bp require a machine with a large capacity motor and hence this process is not suitable for decentralized operation this does not seem to hold enough ground there are smaller machines available in iit delhi a machine with hp motor is due to be installed for making pellets to feed the gasifier similar machines can be used by a local entrepreneur for providing the processed fuel for depending upon the designs it may be possible for at least some of the improved chulhas to be at the local level without compromising on the critical dimensions this will have to be worked out for individual argument of economies of scale must be seen against the backdrop of need for employment generation in the villages rather than making the villagers do labour work provided by the government under the nrega an initiative to develop local entrepreneurs in the activities relevant to the rural populace would be much more is important to keep this in view particularly in a scenario where multinationals would want to capture the huge market of rural areas and not let the local entrepreneurs develop independent of them after the controversial role of multinationals in indian agriculture the emphasis needs to be on empowering the user to meet their energy needs on their own terms if the knowledge base in chulha design rests with only private parties the information is not likely to become open source we need to work towards a situation where this knowledge base is available to anyone who would look for it and already mentioned for a technology like a chulha there have to be different levels of standards some compromise on the performance can bring the cost substantially down hence the certification of chulhas can grade the chulha designs in consonance with their performance with a certain minimum level of performance for is important for mnre to set up labs in different zones of the country for testing and certification of chulhas i would like to state that mnre should be more open and invite all people to participate in the effort rather than identifying narrow groups as tbus in the past which have the monopoly of getting funding from the mnre anyone not belonging to these tbus was never given any funding irrespective of their interest in contributing to the would like to summarize the above points as for to develop the methodologies for chulha design as well as for developing a variety of new designs with high performance catering to a wide range of needs a few groups need to come together to give technical inputs as well those related to field to develop technical information on chulha design which can be accessible to everyone rather than depend primarily on the patented designs by private parties for local entrepreneurship at various levels fuel supply chulha maintenance etc caution needs to be exercised in letting multinationals play a major role in the program since their intent to capture the market may hamper the long term interests of the local community for different levels of standards with a minimum level of performance required for iit delhi three of us in the mechanical engineering department prof mr ravi prof anjan ray and i have been involved in analysis of some stoves in the past decade or so besides prof rajendra prasad from centre for rural development and technology was associated with npic earlier and has developed certain stove designs we can formulate proposals for further work as part of this initiative for now i would like to say on behalf that we would like to be a part of primarily the group with participation in the group on standardization as desirable delivery model for large scale dissemination of improved hafeezur rehman teri new experience suggests some bottlenecks in large scale deployments of cook stoves review of various cook stove related deployment initiatives at local or regional level suggests women are main users of technology promotion dissemination or deployment of improved cook stoves needs to be targeted towards women this requires a marketing and delivery strategy that keeps women at the centre of the dissemination process and related stakeholders have limited capacities for taking the dissemination and deployment process forward in this context the understanding of rural market chains and the possibility of on some of them needs to be rural households express interest to purchase cookstoves but may not be in a position to pay upfront hence financial incentives need to be worked out in a manner that benefits end users while ensuring development of a sustainable market value the shelf availability of quality products at the local level needs to be ensured this would require development of a value chain also for select technologies capacity needs to be developed at local level to ensure decentralized modification of these technologies to cater to local needs sales service and repair is necessary for sustaining adoption of new cooking technology if proper repair maintenance and replacement of spares is not in place then users often revert back to the traditional stoves therefore it is desirable that decentralized repair and maintenance facilities are available close to the end users on the above mentioned points it is desirable that a strategy is formulated for a robust delivery mechanism before actual implementation of a national level programme to avoid repeating the identified from past experience some of the key action points in this regard have been indicated consultations with manufacturers ngos and government entities who been associated with cookstove related dissemination of groups for taking forward different components of the action lacs conferences regional national participants each return airfare lunch of existing best practices and successful dissemination models for improved cook stoves through review of secondary literature eg from npic models of arti and derive learning related to delivery mechanisms what works and what does not work under various specific gaps in market value chain development for large scale deployment of on identified gaps at policy market and capacity levels for large scale deployment of cook stoves capacity building needs for development of an end user friendly market chain for large scale deployment of cookstoves state level nodal training centre for imparting technical business management and personality development skills for various stakeholders like rural entrepreneurs responsible for sales and after sales and compare approaches for centralized and decentralized deployment of cook stove technology including business models optimal supply chain management strategy clearly identifying strategy for both macro level centralized manufacturing and decentralized local level entrepreneurship lacs need for field based trials to compare and test of desirable financial support mechanisms through literature review consultation with manufacturers financial institutions and end options for financial incentive and support such as cdm to companies for research and facilitate economy of scale production users to ensure wider penetration of improved cooking specific policy regulatory and financing related recommendations for evolving a robust delivery process for large scale specific policy recommendations and financing schemes like specific role of manufacturers government agencies entrepreneurs and civil society bs dutta energy india private qpre energy india private limited are interested to be involved in all the below groups if d and technology processing its cost and of improved chullas and incentives monitoring and is a few our initial ideas that need to be considered note that we would provide additional feedback as we get d and technology quality and newer technology incentives financial and tax breaks for support and subsidy for patenting technologies especially outside india to protect the intellectual indoor air technology transfer and provide tax standard does not fit all each technology warrants different design and operational modes so the standards to evaluate to be created to evaluate at par testing conditions should be considered for example stoves which take less fuel is designed to take multiple refuel but stove which are design to take more fuel need not have many refuels the standards cannot test the stove which does not need refuels the same way by putting less fuel and keep refuelling remember that refuelling does cause additional smoke particular matter especially in gasification when the stove is designed for less refuelling a common standard will give the impression that the stove did not meet standards where in reality it has met the standards and in fact better performs and post training should be considered as part of setting moderately efficient design capable of offering sustained performance under field conditions will be more desirable than an extremely efficient design which is very sensitive to operational in to consider practical usage of the stove and not set the standard that does not serve any practical usage processing its cost and to consider various fuel used and food habits for our fuel wood to promote deforestation should be should be able to work with any kind of fuel is a failed strategy strategy should be to let the use the available biomass in the geographical region cost of supplying fuel is very expensive and subsidizing that will lead to costly maintenance of the stove of improved chulhas and is a very sensitive issue with the end user price of the stove cannot be the only consideration it has been proven that the quality and the practical usage of the stove is what will make this a success and not only the cost of stove should be provided and in fairness the subsidy should be based on average costing percentage of the selling price subsidy cannot favour one manufacturer or the other for example providing a fixed subsidy of say rs will favour a manufacturer which mrp is rs and will hurt the dissemination of a stove whose mrp is rs finance should be considered to make this program a quick incentives monitoring and taxes vat cst should be manufacturers who require capital funds to expand and provide healthy competition should be helped by the central government though the product can be competitive some manufacturers who have large backing of funds can over run the competition not by the quality of the stove but by the sheer length of time that they can sustain without any help from external manufacturers should be provided with some percent of advance money for the purchase orders to better facilitate cash flow be implemented in a decentralized demonstration of chulhas should be the considered so that end user should feels that the change is for the betterment over old traditional to have good number of workshops exhibitions at panchayat levels to bring in awareness about improves stoves benefits benefits like increase in leisure time for womenfolk to actively participate in family and community the burden on the government health care programs should be the back bone for this success of the program as that of the implementing agency will certainly lie in making a choice of right model for each location the chulhas should not only be efficient but it should also be rugged and offer persistent good performance for a range of fuel and a range of improved chulha saves nothing nor provides any benefits if it is not used similarly if it is not used in large numbers then the impact will be lass significant therefore the purpose of dissemination must be to share and distribute the implementation monitoring need is to show the quantity of different household fuels required to meet the lifeline consumption of fuel for cooking in targeted srinivasan joint adviser

storming consultation on improved biomass on th march it was indeed a privilege and pleasure to be part of the thought process to revive improved cook stove programme that has the power to lighten the lives and mitigate the drudgery of women over burdened with household chores of which the most cumbersome and hazardous yet unavoidable being the cooking fuel cycle at the side apart from this the cook stove programme assumes paramount significance in view of the contribution it can make to sustainable development agenda energy and climate change issues from rural areas and from households with relatively lesser means though not necessarily from the bpl section of the society are hard hit by continued use of traditional chulhas and fuel wood scarcity compounded by pollutant emissions from traditional stoves in such a scenario the value of improved with and without chimney cannot be under estimated and under stated was to the chagrin of the millions of women burning biomass in their kitchens using crude locally handmade chulhas that the improved chulha programme npic came to a standstill in those women who adopted improved chulhas in gujarat state were willing to incur the cost of getting replacements for worn out chulhas and those who were not covered under the scheme were willing to pay for its cost to own the same realization of the benefits of improved chulhas to conserve fuel wood to ensure a clean smoke free cooking area to make cooking a pleasant activity and to ensure a positive impact on health had dawned on the women cooks and their families the user women were handicapped to get replacements of parts or the chulha in totality as per specifications to reinstall or remake thermally efficient chulhas that have worn out for want of local technically qualified persons and due to non availability of replacements in the local market and lack of government impetus those with some imagination either made replicas of the model on their own or repaired them many a time altering the dimension specifications unintentionally thereby affecting thermal efficiency of the stove to a negligible extent to render their kitchens smoke and soot free and also to reap other benefits associated with it adopters as well as its potential users in gujarat state had begun to reveal confidence in the technology and in the government programme as a result of the hard work of the staff of tbsu baroda and the strong support it received from govt of gujarat and govt of india through the then mnes and the multi model multi design multi agency approach that was followed in implementation of npic at grass root level then the commitment of the many ngos and district development officers and their staff due to the continuous follow up by tbsu baroda too contributed to the success of npic in gujarat there was demand for improved chulhas in the state of gujarat where the undersigned was looking after the technical back up support unit under npic since till it was at such a time that the programme came to a standstill is very heartening to note that the govt of india mnre is envisaging revival of improved chulha programme improved cookstoves programme is a complex technology transfer programme as it covers a multitude of population with diverse cooking practices food habits and taboos and beliefs centring on the stove or the fire place for meal preparation also another important ground reality is that in many kitchens in the rural semi urban and urban areas meals have been and are cooked and served on zero cost chulhas using free fuels of the stove programme also entails rebuilding the confidence in the end users in particular and the people in general regarding a massive initiative like npic forward for immediate future time tested improved designs and models for immediate programme of revival of improved chulhas say npic should start without losing time with existing time tested thermally efficient designs of improved chulhas with and without chimney with remarkably low emission characteristics ie well within the standards ear marked or set such existing models range from to or so depending on its model design features and material plus cost of chimney wherever applicable for about six to eight months the programme may include improved in local mixture however this should be a stop gap arrangement until mass production in iron materials is in place the time frame for the same shall not exceed six to eight months efforts ought to be made to revive and those who were identified and trained and those who collaborated under npic to manufacture prototype design simultaneously improved stove programme with stoves in mixture made in situ should be weaned out ie within six to eight months or earlier as soon as a few manufacturers of iron stoves are established this effort would help to recapture the time confidence and demand lost over the years since chulhas are available for use of mixed bag of biomass and with power ratings of more than adequate to meet domestic cooking needs stoves for dry dung cake and large capacity cooking have grating as an additional feature models in durable and robust material include those in cast iron or those with cast iron liners cast iron liners could well be within to in the case of two pot models at the present less durable models than those with cast iron liners are those with pottery or ceramic liners cost could be or or so respectively with a life of three to five years or more depending on the care in use and handling in transportation is a factor to be taken into consideration while fixing cost or for free replacements under terms and conditions of order or purchase the cost of cast iron liners is not prohibitive its life years and if used properly a life of the stove cost is an important criterion to consider for passed the quenching test at that time it was priced at rs however it could not reach the commercial level due to reasons beyond the control of tbu baroda samples of cast iron lined chulhas are in use over seven years without any complaints in select immediate promotional efforts should focus on reviving already available durable models like or closed models with i cast iron liners or ii ceramic liners or iii pottery liners iv cast iron chimneyless stoves priyagni with some modification to use fuel as is in normal use without the necessity of chopping them to very short and thin pieces mention some of the field tested most popular models photographs enclosed as a separate file for ready reference in gujarat and that are appropriate to be promoted elsewhere as well are chulha the most popular two pot versatile chulha for a household size ranging from to or a little more members thermal efficiency of in field and to with a wide range of materials like mud with cement plastered finish mortar with cement plastered finish pottery liners in brick masonry and cast iron liners in brick masonry and the last gave the best thermal performance in lab in kitchen performance test the improved chulha mamta chulha the most popular model in gujarat state revealed less consumption on an average as compared to the traditional chulha with a sample size of families for each type of chulha the range being to the reduction in emissions due to improved chulha was observed to be and in reference to co nox and tsp as compared to the traditional shielded chulha in laboratory tests as well as in the field ratio was and in the lab and the field household tests respectively mamta a fixed model gave a little better performance than priyagni model a portable metal chulha in emission characteristics the air samples were collected at the breathing zone of a cook squatted on the floor cm away from the stove the fact that the improved chulhas like mamta chulha and portable metal chulha are far more superior to traditional chulha studied by tbsu baroda is reported in air pollution energy and health for the issue no december a publication of esmap the world chulha two pot versatile chulha for a large household of to members or a little more thermal efficiency of in thermal efficiency of to and sumamta chulha thermal efficiency of to single pot designs with chimney note use of grating improves thermal efficiency i one pot closed design and ii with grating two pot closed design for dung cake and logs of fuel wood improved chulhas without chimney in one and two pot stoves were also designed and developed in mud and field tested for one pot stove and to for two pot stove in mud and in liners the performance of stove acceptability was cent per cent these are low cost or zero material cost chulhas if made in local mixture and pottery ceramic cost rs to per unit of one and two pot shielded chulhas respectively chimney cast is an additional cost to this from the above models portable metal stove priyagni stove has also been promoted in gujarat state chulhas under i to vi above have been tested successfully in the field over many years with some adaptation as to the orientation of stove opening where required in the states of gujarat kerala and uttaranchal pottery and ceramic liners and cast iron liners of such stoves to be laid in mortar body in situ with ceramic tiles refractory tiles on top apart from cement concrete chulhas have also been developed and tested in the lab and field successfully by tbu baroda these are versatile designs appropriate for cooking across a cross section of users with differing economic background household size cooking needs meal practices and cooking habits to say that there may be other models too that can be promoted in other states along with these models in extreme cold regions shielded chulhas will be appropriate other than those closed ones with water jacket for heating water utilizing waste heat from flue gas the existing models and designs of improved stoves may be assessed to short list the better of the same with representations from each variant design and model for implementation under the national programme the feedback on performance lab and field test reports thermal and emission from designer or tbsu the establishment of ceramic unit and prototype design development of cast iron models etc can be some of the criteria to shortlist the same as these can speed up the process combustion chamber of these models and designs can be further improved to obtain higher efficiency and lower emission values however it should be borne in mind that it would work out cheaper and more advantageous in the context of cdm to compromise a little on the efficiency and design to make the improved versions that are more user appropriate simple to operate and reasonable in cost and workable and acceptable technology that will serve to achieve the global national local and end user goals agenda and development for new design future models of improved chulha should be cost effective affordable to average households should not burden unduly the exchequer should be versatile and user and environment friendly to accommodate variety of fuels natural and processed therefore my interest lies in all the five areas identified cooking needs cooking practices cooking methods and other requirements of the family easily maintainable by any one responsible for cooking and allied tasks with local availability of easily replaceable parts with excellent market tie ups for spare parts repair and maintenance and even replacements these stoves should also exhibit improved emission characteristics than the available new should be simple in details and should be such that the same can be developed in pottery or ceramic liners user and environment friendly design contest in new improved solid biomass burning attract the best design of combustion chamber and stove a contest may be organized though it may not be of much use the best design will be the one that satisfies i a minimum thermal efficiency value for fixed closed models and or so for portable models ii low pre decided emission values for pollutants that pose health hazard co tsp etc and iii a pre determined price range of rs to that is affordable to average households and with the least burden on the exchequer for those to whom a lifeline supply is envisaged like bpl families and other special categories such as srcitizens further the prototypes will be subjected to iv field tests to assess their comparative user acceptability and the best design will be identified on the basis of criteria i to iv as mentioned above under b and others as deemed appropriate if none of the entries meet the criteria set for the contest no design will be adjudged as the prize winning entry in case of any winning entry the design of the same may be purchased by goi for promotion in the new should be simple in details and should be such that the same can be developed in pottery or ceramic multi model multi design multi model multi design approach as earlier is required to revive and implement npic one single approach will not be adequate to meet the cooking requirements of the diverse population of india potential users of improved chulhas who burn solid biomass fuels range from i those under bpl who gather fuel free of cost to those who are affluent families with large or very large farms or plantations who either has free fuel supply from own lands or buy from the market who reside in rural urban or semi urban areas and those who use a multitude of solid biomass fuels like low dense leafy biomass coconut tree leaves or others to dry dung cakes to fuel wood of different qualities and densities and ii those who cook simple meals comprising of one item like rice or roti or composite meals like rice or any other cereal dhal mix as in khichdi or complex multi dish meals and iii those who use a variety of cooking methods boiling stewing steaming roasting broiling pan roasting or barbequing tandoori roti making baking brewing and so on and so forth and iv vessels of varied dimensions shapes flat and round bottomed and materials apart from this there are v rural households with cattle and livestock that will require a stove to cook animal feed too in addition to cooking family meals some will require vi a portable chulha while a large number will require fixed chulhas some may prefer vii a chulha with chimney while some may want to go for a chulha without chimney viii some may be small medium or large while some may be single member units and some may want a chulha to be transported to the fields for a long period of time irrespective of the diversity of requirements they all would like to smoke pollutant emissions and soot due to burning different forms of biomass fuels in the stove from kitchen or cooking area to the outside so that their tasks of cooking and maintenance of chulha and its premises remain a pleasant easy one on the field realities the following probably explains the approaches required for low end improved chulhas costing rs to on a sharing basis with differential levels of subsidy depending on the client traits like bpl category to ensure a life line supply of and fuel to name a few categories that need special consideration for lifeline supply are bpl families inclusive of sr citizens physically challenged cooks etc under this category pottery liners of thermally efficient shielded designs and mortar models of improved stoves to be included these liners may be fixed in situ in mixture or as per local traditional practice the already trained potters may need refresher training in the identified improved stoves with the best performance characteristics rs to rs and high end rs to rs improved fixed or portable chulhas closed or shielded type without and with differential levels of subsidy depending on the economic strata of the client and end use technology features and fuel type special fuel size and type like briquettes etc to ensure a life line supply of and fuel to name a few categories that need special consideration for lifeline supply are families sr citizens physically challenged cooks etc under this ceramic pottery and cast iron liners of improved chulha models and metal improved stoves closed or shielded type need to be promoted the fixed designs may be installed in situ using these stoves are more durable stoves as under a and b may be large or medium power rated chulhas with one or two pot facility as agency on the field requirements and the models chosen for dissemination in a location multi agency approach will be required to promote the technology in case of factory manufactured portable metal chulha and fuels or fixed chulhas with pottery ceramic cast iron liners and other parts like chimney cowl etc probably with a user manual manual appropriate distribution channel need to be in place in the case of low cost improved stoves in cement concrete or in pottery and to install liners iron of medium cost stoves in in situ local work force is an absolute necessity to trouble shoot and to attend to repair and maintenance the same work force as above can be equipped either of the cases as in b and c above the remuneration to the service personnel should come from the end user or technology adopter in improved burning stove technology and processed improved burning stove technology and processed fuels provide wide scope for impacting rural economy through entrepreneurship and distribution channels at the local level strategy should be in place to make easily available parts of improved chulha or the stove in totality all components in the local market for quick installation of the entire chulha and replacements of worn out parts this was observed to be a significant problem encountered by the local adopters of the said technology in villages a delay in availability can force the user to switch back to traditional open fire or shielded chulha as cooking task cannot be like improved chulhas processed fuels too need to be produced and marketed in a decentralized manner to encourage local entrepreneurship and easy marketing appropriate marketing and distribution channel such as entrepreneur dealer agent retailer chain pds as well as self employed local entrepreneurial work force shgs kudumbasrees or nrega or even artisans need to be developed and roped processing its cost and decentralized approach to promote local entrepreneurship individual or group as in shgs or kudumbasrees is necessary to make processed fuels available locally at relatively lower cost need for the same and also to impact upon local economy along with regional or sub regional centers for large scale production is necessary to ascertain the existing and potential market and existing status of technologies and self employed entrepreneurs in the field of precessed fuls for solid biomass burning stoves in the country strategy and unified client publicity need based location client and technology specific promotional strategy is an absolute requirement for effective percolation and adoption of improved chulhas in the field more or less unified promotional education modules need to be developed and adopted by all concerned to popularize the improved chulhas at the grass root level or at the end user multi pronged approach rather than fuel conservation and national need approach is required to make the technology penetrate into all the solid burning households this is so as the cost of fuel for cooking and stove are not a part of family expenditure moreover until efforts were directed towards the goal of making thermally efficient pollution free traditional cook stoves under npic no concerted scientific input had gone into it in india neither the women nor their family considers it important to switch over to improved chulhas to save fuel or its cost as it is a free fuel for them experience has shown that adequately demonstrated to users is a major motivating factor for them to adopt improved stove technology once the technology is accepted and adopted as an integral part in daily cooking all other benefits positive impact on climate change mitigation of black carbon clean cooking area etc will follow mention a few of the different approaches that need to be focused on in promotional modules are efficiency fuel conservation time and effort saving elimination or noticeable reduction in pollution within the standards permissible health impact on women children and elderly impact on climate change black carbon other tsp etc of modern technology and upward mobility in the fuel ladder to the extent of promotion from crude traditional stone or shielded low efficient chulhas to improved chulhas and also from crude biomass to processed biomass like briquettes to liquid gaseous opportunity cost in continued use of trc which would deprive them of income generating skill acquisition and generation of income thereof better care of children others and self and scope for income generation through the potential for entrepreneurship self employment individually or in groups as by self help groups etc in improved and improved fuel is important to take into consideration the mob psychology or the desire to keep up with the ie to go for a model like the neighbour has though not appropriate here proper assistance and education of the user family and the cook is of utmost importance to assist them to make the right appreciation related to traditional stove material modern materials should be borne in mind while considering stove for dissemination for example in kerala the traditional stoves have been and are still in pottery liners and so improved mud chulhas will not have much relevance except probably in hilly regions and tribal areas where even pottery liners will be appreciated by an average user whereas in other areas improved chulhas in cast iron liners laid in brick masonry with tiled preferably refractory tiled top surface would be appreciated and development labeling and name plate specifications need to be drawn for portable metal and fixed chulhas with cast iron liners of each of the specific improved designs a certain minimum performance level and emission characteristics ought to be in place for a design model to become eligible for consideration of certification improved stoves ought to be given green label one two or three green circles etc in consonance with its potential to reduce emissions environment friendly traits so as to enable the potential users to select the model health benefits and improved chulhas may be graded as grade i grade ii grade iii etc in accordance with its performance characteristics both thermal and emission with grade i and green circles denoting the best in both features respectively a stove may carry grade i ii or iii label with one two or three green circles as the case may be approved model and its parts thereof should carry name plate with all necessary details as deemed appropriate along with a card this would empower the users apart from enhancing the accountability of the who are willing to comply by the standard specifications for the production of the said cast iron liners or metal chulhas should be approved as per the provisions under the indian standards act to use standard mark isi assuring quality of the product may be provided to manufacturers who show readiness to make such cast iron liners or metal chulhas as per standard improved solid biomass burning stoves will have assured minimum thermal performance and low emission characteristics and will ensure minimal health hazards clean cooking and other benefits to end users apart from meeting national goals and international agenda on climate change of role in drawing up policy decisions and implementation strategies needs special emphasis has a significant role to play in the replacement of all mud chulhas from the field at all costs by improved stoves i with liners in pottery ceramic cast iron and ii metal stoves as early as possible as a measure to revolutionize cooking task this is a target that ought to be achieved in a stipulated time frame mnre has a pivotal role in setting up of new tbsus and revival of old tbsus and well equipped laboratories backup support units are needed to support the programme the role of experienced scientists to participate in the programme of revival of the improved chulha programme and to give leadership and direction in different states cannot be under stated the experienced leaders can be great assets not only to the revival scheme but also its management monitoring feedback and shall be the prerogative of government mnre in consultation with the tbsus and a few other stakeholders in the programme as deemed fit and necessary to draw up standard specifications as well as scheme for labelling and affixing name plates etc in appropriate designs and mnre should take up evaluation of existing designs and models of improved stoves through a select set of its new or old using experienced staff of tbsus as it is necessary to further short list the best of the stoves from different existing designs and models as appropriate for different households in different locations the existing status and potential for processed fuel market including technologies need to be assessed to measure the scope for furthering this as an area for decentralized entrepreneurial ventures equipped labs need to be set up in a decentralized manner especially with proven committed scientists in partnering institutes where tbsus may be these laboratories will undertake testing of chulhas to assess its performance characteristics both thermal and emission characteristics material design and development both women and men in individual capacity or in groups training and establishment of such entrepreneurs in metal cast iron or other liners and in strong durable robust metal portable improved cook stoves need to be taken up in a big on a war footing but organized decentralized manner to meet the local needs of the programme it is of utmost significance to promote local entrepreneurship in improved cook stove technology in the context of multinationals wanting to capture the indian biomass burning cook stove market a huge market of households and other establishments devouring the scope of establishment of local entrepreneurs who are capable of improving local economies through the manufacture of stoves to meet the differing needs of the diverse population and partnerships need to be supported adequately and appropriately by the government as an initiative to involve promising new scientific interests in design modification and development of new innovative user friendly concepts in improved chulha the programme periodically and assess the need for policy changes formulation of new policies etc to enhance the penetration and adoption of the programme to all end users within the shortest time in an efficient and effective of improved chulhas and cost of improved chulhas and financial aspects like cost should be chalked out in accordance with the design model and all factors of cost of production profit loss in transportation and so on and so forth along with fiscal incentives in order to encourage it with minimal burden on the exchequer and the families bpl to technical backup support units role of technical backup support units in a massive programme like improved programme where of indian households if not or more are to be covered cannot be under stated or undervalued tbsus need to be supported with adequate staff and finances for work training to build and strengthen capabilities get manufacturers of shielded and closed models established undertake tests as testing laboratories for standardization purpose as recognized by bis assess performance characteristics thermal and emission of improved biomass stoves for promotion in the monitor to follow up and get feedback from all stake holders especially from entrepreneurs manufacturers and everyone in the channel of distribution end users ngos and gos etc assist the government in all matters pertaining to the programme including policy directions to enhance effectiveness and efficiency of implementation of the programme and achieve the goals and any other task as deemed fit and needed is of utmost importance that the tbsus be headed by scientists with proven track record dedication and commitment to biomass fuel conservation mitigation of hardships and health hazards of women who are the main participants in cooking fuel cycle and have an understanding of the larger picture and relevance of the technology in the global and national scene cdm economic development etc incentives monitoring and feedback incentives like tax holidays and exemption of excise duty cost sharing subsidy to ensure life line supply of both the technology and fuel or loan and others as deemed fit and appropriate need to be in place to encourage and promote entry of entrepreneurs into the scheme and adoption of the technology by end users proper mechanism to publicize popularize and promote as well as encourage adoption at end user side to monitor to collect feedback and to evaluate field performance of the new programme and review of performance of all stakeholders has to be in place to ensure its of the improved cook stove programme and government mnre has a role to play in successfully sustaining the programme of improved cook stoves in the light of cdm at the global level and the well defined goals of conservation reduction in green house gases and tsp in the environment at the national level and mitigation of health hazards from burning solid biomass fuels in domestic cooking and mitigation of hardships of women in cooking fuel cycle and biomass burning households and entrepreneurship development in cook stoves at the local level the programme becomes sustainable through appropriate marketing service and promotional strategy and once the programme has reached a self sustainable stage the role of government will be one to exercise controls and on rural economy in specific and indian economy in of local decentralized entrepreneurship and workforce in the improved cook stove programme assumes great significance in view of the diversity of requirements of the diverse population of the country the spread of its population and the contribution it can make to semi urban rural tribal urban economy and per capita income of the people even in semi urban and urban households of many states of the country solid biomass burning stoves are in use either for part of the cooking tasks or in the social burden arising due to loss of man days and medical care expenditure incurred by the government on chronically ill persons with respiratory ailments due to exposure to pollutant emissions from traditional and poorly designed solid fuel burning stoves can be mitigated through thermally efficient non polluting with emissions well within the standards ear marked or set of view of my active involvement prior to npic in the assessment of rural domestic energy consumption and traditional cooking devices issues and development and later on as in charge of tbsu i have been actively involved in various aspects of improved cook stove technology development and dissemination under npic our designs and models are user appropriate since the starting point was the traditional chulha and an evolution of improved based on traditional chulha and user requirements i have successfully developed prototype models in cast iron apart from pottery and ceramic liners and established manufacturers in ceramic liners and conducted emission studies in the lab and field apart from thermal performance studies and kitchen performance tests in lab and field i have also undertaken various other tasks related to npic our contribution is well documented and acknowledged nationally and internationally therefore my interest lies in all the five areas from harish a part of the improvements in the process and as requested in the last meeting held on we hereby submit our recommendations which would make the whole initiative a grand success and take this initiative to a step which would stand as a bench for awareness generation as we are aware that indoor air pollution though is a major health concern and a global health hazard is quite not known to people users tg who are affected by it the one reason for this is the fact that there is no awareness pertaining to the ill effects of iap how it effects life this is not an immediate effect hence people relate immediately hence requires a strong and reinforcing message to educate this campaign should be a campaign similar to a pulse polio aids campaign initiated by government of india these campaigns have taken the issues of polio and aids to a level where no other media would have created the impact for ex simple things like the cough due to excessive inhaling of indoor smoke iap is often referred by the user as a normal health issue due to weather changes etc this is a small example but many more to quote due to the lack of decision maker is man and not the user the decision maker in a house is man cases it is an easy job to convince the woman of the house as they could be convinced by demonstrations but the final decision of buying or not depends upon the man getting convinced the man of the family needs to be educated on the cost of technology by way of proper messaging of both the technology and the product in itself a projection of the savings over a period of time in terms of fuel health and time should be materialized to make them understand and subsequently convince on the recommendation protocols and standards consider a situation where the user and the decision maker is convinced on the need to adopt clean cooking stoves and agree to the iap part of the issue but do not know how to differentiate one stove from another it is a further critical situation which needs utmost attention there needs to be a proper and defined standards for testing these products the standards should be a bench mark to judge which stove is a clean burning one and which one is not the standards should be made aware to each and every one who wants to take up improved cook stoves on a commercial or social angel not just drafting the standards but also checking on the proper availability of testing labs and equipments which would test the stoves as per the set standards for any of the ex we at envirofit tested the stove at multiple locations in india and testing standards were different hence the results were different now this is a dilemma for any manufacturer as the results are what matters at the end of the day and if the testing standards and protocols are not in place then there is no way of getting an improved stove which would be approved and accepted by everyone and by the designated of quality once the awareness is raised and a user is convinced with the fact that improved cook stoves will change their lives then comes the question of which stove has to be bought this dilemma can be solved only if the shortlisted improved cook stoves have a symbol of energy efficiency label of recognition and accreditation that these are the best of the improved smokeless stoves available for money the stoves should not be given for free rather should be subsidized and a part of the money should be paid by the consumer a free item loses its worth the moment it is declared as free and is not used with the requisite supervision monitoring and timely and timely surveys of the stoves should be collected either before launching the launching the project directly from the field from the consumers results in the lab should not be the only way to decide on a stove being very good but at the same time the ease with which a user can use the given stove is what would matter if the stove is too complicated to requires too many preparations then the user would discontinue the stove within a few days and get back to the three stone chulha itself and spread negative word about the stove there needs to be training for this habit option an easy option of providing micro credits to people through banks for buying the product should be looked at the product since should not be given free could be given on easy payment options which would give them a value for money and value for from kerosene the amount of subsidy given in the form of can be revised to encourage more people to use and accept clean burning cook stoves in to their life this would reduce the dependency of fossil fuels for cooking purposes as well as ease on the shortages of the fossil fuels this could be done at the government of india level policy making credits as you might be aware that the improved cook stoves reduce the emissions which could be turned in to a carbon credits project this could be used for the awareness generations or any cost subsidy to the user and government can link this with emission reductions the outcome from the carbon credits can be used for funding the awareness exemptions to entrepreneurs the taxes applicable such as import duty should be exempted for such energy efficient products and motivate the manufacturers to device such clean energy product for the benefit of usage the improved cook stoves should be able to operate on any kind of bio mass fuels available in the market and not be specific to only one kind of fuel these restrictions on fuel type usage increase the disliking element in the users and an additional cost to the user it is also a huge habit change which cannot be done all at once when there is such a huge free availability of biomass at the rural for testing on an immediate basis an emission or a testing lab to be setup in india in collaboration with a well emission testing lab globally this will help the stakeholders to align on a common platform and serve the rural market dissemination areas concentration of the project should be in areas where there is plenty of bio mass availability this would encourage the people to use the product and benefit from the for dissemination the govt channels for delivery dissemination should be made available for awareness generation delivery sales of the stoves the channels to be considered are the indian posts pds rural retail outlets ministry of women child development centres awareness in schools the kids would be a major influence on the parents for the purchase of stoves hence the usage of stoves in anganwadis and the iap education in the rural schools would be a major would be more for discussion on the nd and rd march workshop and look forward to the detail agenda from your b of stoves of new and renewable block cgo delhi deepak mnre gauri

appendix e of cook stove previous cook stove rural technology rural technology institute arti was the technical support unit tbu for npic in maharashtra from april to march and has since partnered with philips and the shell foundation to continue distributing cook stoves as the tbu for npic arti had notable success in promoting the commercialization of cook stoves in order to ensure uniform quality of cook stoves moulds of the various models were created to be used for these cook stoves were delivered to households within a to kilometer radius centre for application of science and technology for rural development castford tbu before arti selected hereditary potters who were already constructing traditional stoves to become the self employed workers in addition to giving these potters special training in the construction and maintenance of improved cook stoves the tbu encouraged them to start their own improved chulha manufacturing enterprises by providing information about financial assistance when arti took over as the tbu it organized annual improved cook stove training and entrepreneurship development courses for the furthermore the novice entrepreneurs received extra assistance in acquiring improved cook stove installation contracts so that they could gain experience and become established as the suppliers of improved cook stoves in their this program was so successful that when npic ended the did not seem concerned about maintaining good business selling improved cook stoves without subsidies in the open market thus commercialization had successfully promoted usage of improved cook stoves in rural after arti stopped receiving funding from npic the shell foundation stepped in to provide funding for cook stove dissemination programs the shell foundation also brought in accenture development partnerships to give business mentoring and advice to arti about training the local the shell foundation also provided funding to development alternatives da which sold stoves under breathing space pilot and established connections with tarahaat a marketing network that sells products in rural areas and has contacts on the local astra used an entrepreneur model to disseminate cook stoves in karnataka the entrepreneur distributed the stoves as described in box this method has proven successful for a number of reasons including the nature of the program link between profit and quality maintenance after construction education of users and the entrepreneur only builds a stove when a household is ready to purchase one the fact that the entrepreneur continues to make sales proves that there is demand for these stoves the need to earn profits and keep up a steady demand for stoves motivates the entrepreneur to maintain high quality construction and in addition to repairing stoves that were broken or performing poorly the entrepreneur imparted user education about efficient cooking practices since households buy stoves without government subsidies they were in a position to demand quality construction from the shape mergeformat stove dissemination approach adopted by the entrepreneur in uttara kannada informatics and design technology informatics and design endeavours tide bangalore also worked on dissemination of cook stove tide utilized market mechanisms to create local infrastructure for the dissemination of stoves developed by tide in collaboration with the institute for youth and development iyd sold the stoves without subsidies and ensured consistent quality by constructing stoves with moulds women were selected to be make stoves as they could best understand cooking needs and be better able to communicate the benefits of an improved stove the women entrepreneurs could only construct stoves in the few villages surrounding her own and were be able to service the stoves after construction since the woman entrepreneurs were held accountable for the stoves she constructed she was motivated to build stoves stove construction was an venture but women did not feel comfortable leaving the security of agricultural labor to construct stoves therefore tide promoted this activity as one that would supplement their agricultural income partnered with local ngos that possessed the skills to work within the rural context understood the dynamics of the villages and were trusted by the local communities instead of training individual women the rural ngos trained groups that could operate the stove business as a and divide the tasks among the women the group was selected based on their motivation and socioeconomic statuses of its the training sessions included the following to a smokeless convenience and positive impact on health when cooking on a smokeless of stove construction during construction by the construction by women trainees at the training construction by women in houses where would be used for the stove construction manual and its and to a quiz on stove construction for the trainer to understand if the women grasped the discussion session training tide and iyd provided support to start up the in the form of financial assistance technical and promotional materials to advertise the stoves to the national improved stove program and national improved stove program nisp successfully distributed approximately million improved cook stoves into rural areas of china and about of these were actually adopted and nisp is widely considered the most successful improved cook stove initiative in the developing world a number of factors contributed to this success but some of these factors come into play only in the chinese context according to smith et al chinese started from a higher compared to indians in rural areas chinese villagers have a higher income and thus are more capable of paying for furthermore previous promotion of biogas and had established extensive rural energy infrastructure nisp could build upon these experiences and rural energy channels to disseminate a large number of cook the advantages china may have over other countries india could learn some lessons from nisp box unlike npic nisp worked the best areas in other words nisp looked for the areas that not only needed the improved stoves but also was financially managerially and technically prepared to take on the program and had sufficient biomass furthermore counties needed to prove their motivation to actually execute the program by competing in a provincial contest to be selected as a pilot county by the bureau of environmental protection and energy signed contracts directly with bepe in order to cut out middlemen and eradicate an excessively long bureaucratic pathway by minimizing bureaucracy nisp was able to operate more efficiently but systematic monitoring and evaluation was integral to the success of nisp in china provincial rural energy offices this acted mostly independently selected and oversaw teams that would check the use and condition of improved cook stoves in households without evaluation there is no way to ensure the adoption proper use and working condition of the stoves consumers paid for the stoves in full without government assistance the chinese government provided very little financial support only of what utilized for administration promotion and training households were more interested in properly using and maintaining the stoves when they have invested fully in it themselves therefore the adoption rate was much higher by minimizing the amounts of money flowing between bureaucratic levels for instance the largest transmission of funds was from bepe to a county nisp reduced turf the temptation to graft and inefficient delays in transferring money between multiple ensured sustainability of the cook stove program strategy to fully commercialize cook stoves involved supporting rural energy companies these enterprises generated demand and sold other rural energy technologies in addition to improved cook stoves thereby providing multiple energy solutions to rural factors of nisp program that could be applied to an indian improved cook stove selected current cook stove developed new cook stove models the models are both natural draught and forced draught and the price of natural draught model is rs and that of forced draught in the range of rs rs the company is currently discussing with various state governments the possibility of adoption of the model in the ongoing or future state government initiatives on improved cook shell foundation is providing funding to envirofit international which is based at colorado state university csu and working closely with engines and energy conservation laboratory to develop and disseminate improved cook stoves in india envirofit is working with local indian distributors to come up with rural supply chains for the cook stoves envirofit intends to achieve its goals through business model driving economic market research disciplined research and development modern product development process robust durability and emissions global supply chain supporting centralized distribution sales networks marketing strategies partnerships with global organizations and local mfis ngos and global awareness raising and brand building about envirofit and the problems we look to energy petroleum bp and later first energy have sold over stoves mostly in maharashtra and karnataka and some in madhya pradesh and tamil nadu stove called in hindi is fueled by pellets made from agricultural waste the oorja stove utilizes pellets because energy discovered that users saw chopping wood into small pieces for the firebox as an obstacle and preferred a steady supply of processed fuel that requires minimal additional the waste must be pelletized in manufacturing facilities each of which is at the district level and serves a radius of to kilometers first energy recognizes that while increasing stove production should be relatively straightforward scaling up fuel production will be more stoves and pellets are delivered through distributors at the regional level and a network of dealers of these dealers are women entrepreneurs and are shops that are involved in other these women entrepreneurs called demonstrate how the oorja stove works to the village and then sell motivation and family support are important criteria during the jyoti selection process after which they receive training in demonstrations and the receive training in cooking technology so that they understand and can explain the product they are selling first energy intends to invest in creating more networks and distribution channels from the ground up in order to extend the reach of its product so far villagers have not received any financial support but first energy wants to explore financial options such as microcredit loans in areas where people cannot afford to purchase the stoves and biomass existing programs with extensive delivery lever limited has an extensive marketing and distribution network and as of december delivers its products to villages including all villages with populations of more than two thousand residents and cities and towns initiatives such as project shakti and the global partnership for hand washing with soap continue to expand the reach of products into more shakti is a campaign by hll to market its products to rural areas by engaging village women as entrepreneurs who reach out to their communities hll has created a new channel for distribution of products and information as of january project shakti had entrepreneurs serving over small villages with a total population of around fifteen million people in fifteen order to select women entrepreneurs hll contacts local ngos that can provide connections to groups hll chooses women from these shgs who live in villages with populations of less than two thousand people and only one woman is chosen per village and within a radius of one these women are given basic training in sales and accounting to run their own businesses selling hll products either in small shops or by going in the hll is partnering with the indian bank which gives loans to shakti entrepreneurs to purchase hll products to women might be able to disseminate more than hll products education campaign is considering utilizing these women to spread awareness and distribute similarly if project shakti agrees to take on a cook stove initiative these women might be able to disseminate information about the benefits of cook stoves and how to obtain them if not sell the stoves themselves because project shakti is concerned with hygiene and health the cleanliness and health benefits of reduced indoor air pollution with improved cook stove adoption would be partnership for handwashing with global partnership for hand washing with soap aims to promote health and hygiene on a global scale by collaborating with as many interested parties as possible in various countries throughout the developing world hll saw this marketing opportunity for its soap products and partnered with the government of kerala to spearhead this initiative in india with scientific credibility provided by the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine center for disease control and the environmental health project and funding supplied by the world bank usaid unicef and the water and sanitation kerala state government allowed hll to exploit existing infrastructure in order to reach as many people for as little money as possible through government channels such as schools and clinics the hand washing campaign is capable of reaching every village in kerala yuri jain of hll explained that in kerala have the entire government at our we have schools sic social worker centers health centers we have whereas the company itself only do so much we can only cover x number of villages on our order to encourage behavior change the hand washing program reached out to people through direct contact and mass media campaigns direct contact was accomplished through health and social service institutions and schools when women visited the health and social service institutions they were given information about hand washing because these visits were often during events or times when people are most likely to adopt new behaviors such as giving birth or receiving vaccines this strategy was successful furthermore hll carried out an educational program in schools that included four health and hygiene days and compulsory hand washing during lunchtime the hand washing mass media campaign covered every type of media and did not display hll or other brand names or logos it is estimated that the direct contact campaign reached of households in kerala nine times per year and the mass media campaign reached of households times per separate initiative in schools called swasthya chetna promoted lifebuoy products in villages by targeting children and their parents as part of the school program children paraded through the streets of their village chanting slogans about hand washing and prepared and put on skits and presentations about hygiene for the entire village this reinforced their learning after the school day and passed on the messages to their communities furthermore village elders who are very influential on the behavior of the residents of their villages are educated about health and this program has been successfully adopted in a modified form for the global partnership for hand washing with hand washing initiatives have proven the success of utilizing government channels and the same could be done for cook stove dissemination if state governments or the government of india grants access to these channels health institutions and schools could focus on the health benefits associated with improved indoor air quality while social service institutions could emphasize the benefits of reduced time spent on cooking and gathering fuel wood these institutions have the greatest impact on behavior change and may be able to not only create demand for cook stoves but also convince people to actually use is an initiative by itc to connect rural indian farmers with the global agricultural market through internet kiosks in villages in each village itc recruits a a local farmer who manages the internet kiosk in his home for each transaction completed through the kiosk the sanchalak acquires a commission itc thus employs the entrepreneur model the selected sanchalak is someone in the community who the farmers trust for many farmers who may be illiterate or the sanchalak who is trained in computer use and maintenance is a human for the computer village trust in the sanchalak is upheld by requiring sanchalaks to continue farming and establishing the role of sanchalak as similar to a public office rather than a businessman seeking profit the projection of the sanchalak as a public office is strengthened by the title itself a title is a sign of status and a ceremony in which the sanchalak takes a public oath to serve the farming community in front of the focuses on the members of the household who are least affected by the cook type of program might not be the most effective to disseminate improved cook stoves however the importance of village trust should be addressed in any cook stove kisaan bazaar kisaan bazaar started in in del panderva hardoi district uttar pradesh with a store that sold agricultural goods such as animal feed pesticides fertilizer and farm implements by mid hkb had expanded to thirty each serving about to families and to hectares of farmland within a to kilometer radius figure illustrates the services and goods provided by hkb inventory has expanded from farming goods to products that could benefit the families such as fuel lpg medicine kitchenware electronics apparel cosmetics telecommunication services additionally hkb partnered with icici bank to offer financial services bharat petroleum to set up petrol pumps motorola to sell mobile phones and fortis health world to provide healthcare the philosophy of hkb is to become rural hub providing the entire range of services and products to the rural and partnering with these companies helps them attain this goal under this philosophy improved cook stoves could potentially be placed on kisan kendra kisan sansar kisan kendra tkk later renamed tata kisan sansar tks was established by tata chemicals in in order to meet all agricultural needs similar to hkb tks seeks to be the indian and has expanded from agricultural goods and credit services to solar power products telecommunication services lifestyle products kerosene and petrol partnering with indian tks employs a in which each hub acts as a resource center that supplies goods and services to village outlets as of tks was serving million farmers in villages through shops and hubs in punjab haryana uttar pradesh bihar and west services for rural tkks have training and exhibition halls agricultural training workshops such as in geographic information systems gis computer services and new farming techniques and agricultural film screenings are conducted in the training halls exhibition halls hold educational social and entertainment programs for tata kisan parivar a club that tata developed to strengthen relationships with farmers and their tks sells lifestyle products and has great reach into many villages it could potentially become a successful outlet for selling improved cook stoves furthermore if tks collaborates with the cook stove initiative the training centers could be used to train cook stove retailers and installers and the exhibition halls could be utilized to conduct educational programs for users of improved cook services provided by tata kisan report of biomass processing technologies and identification of existing biomass chains for processed energy and resources institute of the and processing processing manufacturers suppliers for biomass processing of existing cook stove experience for supply of processed fuel with existing biomass processing technologies economy and population grow the country should seek domestic and renewable energy resources to feed the growing energy demand india is a developing country and agriculture has always been the mainstay of its economy accounting of of its gross domestic production during it constitutes the backbone of the rural india whose inhabitants are more than of total population resources are plentiful and sustainable resource in india but an about one quarter of the biomass resources remain unused a lot of agricultural waste is generated but only a portion of the kinds of agro waste produced is compatible with current processing technologies much of this agro waste is already being used in rural areas without processing the most important thing about raw material is that there is tremendous variation according to species even within a given species there is significant variation according to region growing conditions and climatic conditions many varieties of biomass are utilized as energy sources biomass can be directly combusted as loose matter fed into gasifier plants for thermal applications or electricity generation or densified into briquettes or pellets to serve as fuel in boilers households use loose biomass for home cooking and some industries and power plants also combust biomass directly burning loose biomass results in conversion efficiencies of about and large amounts of dust and ash pollution therefore processing of biomass and densifying it any form not only improves the quality of fuel but also increase the thermal efficiency of report emphasizes on the status of biomass processing technologies and entrepreneurs involved in briquette and pellet process in india existing supply chain to the target peoples mostly rural areas for processed fuels the report also address the limitation and constraints of the existing technology with respect to new generation cook stoves existing supply chain energy and cost incurred in it and provided herewith some recommendation to overcome these of the of existing biomass processing of existing supply chain for processed of processing technologies with new generation cook constraints with respect to power capacity and the strategies to overcome the technology and other constraints and processing has vast varieties of residues that can be used as fuel for cook stoves residues such as sawdust coffee husk rich husk are in a ready to use form other residues require processing and pre processing for use in combustion purpose the choice and location of a and processing technology are among the most important components of a processing supply system for woody and agro biomass jackson et al figure shows the most commonly used processing and operations flow chart for pre processing and processing of biomass for use in cook processing on the nature of raw material the most common technologies used in india the rate of biomass drying depends on many factors including ambient temperature relative humidity wind speed season rainfall pattern tree and crop species and its size drying of raw material is often required and can be done by open sun drying or with a hot air dryer there are added costs in allowing biomass to dry before processing size reduction of the raw material is done with chippers chippers are heavy machineries wt in these chipping machines require power and litres of fuel to run pulverization reduces biomass particles in size by repeatedly pounding them into smaller pieces through a combination of tensile shear and compressive forces pulverizers accept a wider range of piece sizes they will even accept short pieces including stumps tops brush and large forked branches the pulverizing machines too require high power inputs a hammer mill with a capacity of has a power requirement of hp dhingra et al of biomass can be achieved by different processes briquettes are of standard composition and size usually mm in diameter and has a density of from loose biomass of density to or piston press and screw extrusion machines are two main high pressure technologies that are used for briquetting while briquettes produced by piston press are completely solids screw press briquettes on the other hand have concentric hole which give better combustion characteristics due to large specific area in india the present capacity of individual machines ranges from to briquetting is not only option for processing biomass pelletization of biomass into short narrow cylinders could provide comparable benefits with lower production costs and less energy intensive but pelletizing does require more steps than briquettes in the production process the material must be ground steamed to soften the material pressed through the roller and die and screened to isolate pellets from dust and unpelleted mass manufacturers and suppliers for biomass processing analysis of biomass processing technologies there are a few indian engineering firms manufacturing biomass briquetting and pelletizing machines for the present report information obtained from suppliers and manufacturers on biomass densification technologies were collected and summarized for understanding the existing technologies and its applicability for effective application in the rural sector manufacturers in briquette manufacturing size dia in capacity requirement fuel tech pvt ltd to granulated material vertical feeder gear box and tech agro to to engineering to jumbo models require biomass of proper size and moisture content less than engineering hbp models require biomass with moisture less than and must be powdery or up to mm engineering enerprises to high power for motors and mould agni engg to above tabulated information on briquette manufacturing machineries capacity power requirement and method of production it appears that briquetting technology is not suitable for fuel processing in rural areas as the machines require high power input and also production capacity is huge as compared for a small community necessitate the briquette processing technology is mainly for the production and be used for commercial purposes moreover for the new generation stoves with the requirement of fuels the available briquette sizes are generally unmatched a hypothetical case describing the constraints between the capacity of existing biomass processing machine and fuel requirement for a rural area is mentioned in box manufacturers in pellet manufacturing counter the problems of size of briquettes available status of pelletizing technology in india was examined in india only a few names are found in the list of manufacturers who supply pelletizing tech agro delhi supplies pellet presses in few models which produce pellets of size mm in diameter the output capacity of pellet plant is to with different models which is huge production for household or village utilization engineering also has pelletizing machines which produces pellets of to mm in diameter and production capacity is metric hr energy has gained experience with development of biomass pellets fuel processing system based on both indian fodder pellets machine and imported fuel palletizing machine they have set up two local fodder pellets machines having capacity tpd modified for fuel pellets applications in addition they have set up one imported fuel palletizing machine having ton per hour capacity as part of their cookstove dissemination work the company is able to supply the processed fuel at rs to the endusers these machines are mainly used with saw dust and a few agricultural residues as feedstocks based on the discussion it was clear there is need to these machines on widely available agricultural residues and to reduce the overall operation and maintenance costs of these machines clean energy a company based in gujarat also has gained experience with pelletizing machines and produces pellets based on locally available residues in the state of gujarat the pellets are used in their captive biomass power plant and also sold for industries as boiler fuel the detailed information about operational costs and system performance was not available in public domain of existing cook stove models the aim to address the issues like flexibility in using biomass fuel ie to use locally available fuel adaptability to cook variety of food items adaptability to the usage of different types of vessels many organizations have contributed their valued efforts in designing their versions of the cook stoves the specifications of the stove models developed by ngos are summarized below in table different models of cook stove and their natural draft wood size output kw for forced draft and kw for natural time x efficiency rural technological institute sampada and runs on loose powdery biomass it can operate continuously for to hrs sampada requires dry woody biomass wood chips shavings etc it is a low power stove whereas is a gasifier stove that runs on pellets

less fuel of cook stove of cook stove between rs and rs institute of pulverized fuel stove gasifier stove for pellets and tiny thermal efficiency consumption burn for to between rs kw to rs kw for swosthee and gasifier stove brochures of organization information collected from conference on biomass cook the survey of new generation cook stove it was observed that these stoves demand specific fuel supply for desirable performance there are some other limitations with the dissemination of cook stove technology linked with the processed fuel supply chain the same is addressed in following experience for supply of processed fuel slow rate of spread of improved cook stove technology has been attributed to the existence of several barriers which have been identified in several studies jagadish focusing here one major barrier that is the fuel required for these improved versions of cook stoves whatever the cook stove is available the is the fuel to burn if the fuel used is improper it will certainly affect the performance of cookstove therefore it is important to concentrate on the chain of fuel supply fuel supply chain consists of following components raw material available and processing technologies supply of processed fuel and cost incurred in its use desirability of a fuel in rural areas is based primarily on three factors price reliability and supply in this section we will discuss about the available strategies for fuel supply in rural areas for improved cook stoves and the new approaches to overcome this organizations work on different strategies to fulfill the fuel requirement in the rural india the case studies in this respect are mentioned here in box and is very unfortunate that these kind of running models is very limited and generally get stopped due to one or another constraints thus as there is unavailability of processed fuels people used to fulfill their combustion needs with the local raw form of biomass available with them therefore sufficient supply of processed fuel at their doors will attract them to use the same because using processed fuel not only help in increasing thermal efficiency of cook stoves but also reduces problem of indoor air pollution iap which causes the premature deaths of approximately women and children in india every year smith k with existing biomass processing of the major requirements for large scale deployment of cook stoves in rural areas is to set up decentralized fuel supply linkage around the target areas the limitations associated with biomass processing technologies are constraints limited capacity to assess adopt adapt and absorb technology the briquetting industry overall has stagnated in recent years while some manufacturers are still producing biomass briquetting machines many have diversified into other industries or have closed their doors altogether some of the key barriers in the current biomass briquetting technology are highlighted of the commercially available briquetting machines are of high capacity and produces briquettes required for high input energy and hence not useful for rural applications current biomass briquetting technology utilizes certain types of raw materials only and highly sensitive to raw material major problems in the current technology are on account of high wear of moving parts the processing technologies require fuel of specific characteristics these increase the operation cost of the technology moreover indian machines experienced more breakdowns and required more maintenance lippert at al capacity constraints of existing processing technologies are linked to the production as discussed before size of briquettes pellets obtained from processing technologies are quite big to use in existing cook stoves the cook stove models available required very small sized fuel to burn eg the prototype named sampada works on wood chips pellets and shavings etc cook stove requires wood pieces of specific shape and size and astra stoves iisc model require cutting wood into smaller lengths availability of such specific fuel is bit power requirement is very high for briquetting plant a plant producing mm dia briquettes takes to kwh to produce one tonne of briquettes the grinder or hammer mill use power from the grid the hot air dryer that dry raw material also requires power one study estimates that the energy needs usually amount to of briquettes produced dhingra the requirement of these and processing technologies is not feasible in rural areas therefore there is need to research on biomass processing technologies which require low energy inputs has minimum wear and tear and upgrade the biomass to increase its thermal technology in europe the dominant biomass fuel is pellets even the households and small business markets highly rely on pellets in india pelletization technology is not mature none of the europeans had a strong interest in technology transfer citing mostly infrastructure problems and managerial inexperience lippert et al the quality of raw material available in both the countries india and europe differ in their moisture content texture heating value and other physical properties the high quality sawdust in europe has enabled europe to pursue complete standardization of wood pellet composition in india such standardization is not possible because the raw material used in different regions shows variation the indian industry is characterized by many kinds of raw materials that differ in size shape heating characteristics moisture content etc in addition european machines are often too costly for indian entrepreneurs to import the second major limitation of the existing biomass processing technologies is the cost incurred in the process the cost of the processed fuels is quite high as the processes and operations involve in densification of biomass are costly the cost of the processing technologies increased due to the following material cost it was found that to of production of pellets is on account of raw material cost biomass processing entrepreneurs face three costs associate with raw material first there is cost of raw material itself which entrepreneurs tend to purchase mainly from consolidated suppliers or sometimes from individual farmers and producers depending on the raw material and the region second there is cost of drying grinding and otherwise processing the raw material to make it suitable for processing into pellets thirdly there is the cost of transportation of biomass from source to machines and finally to cost energy cost to run processing plants often exceeds original project estimates for an example the briquetting machines require units of power per hour some other processes require power from grid

tips for next my top tips for entering a business plan submit a plan until you have traction my biggest surprise a judge was the lack of traction demonstrated by many of the three of the six plans i judged even have a website the investment round of the uw competition judges are asked invest a hypothetical so the same mentality used investors in the real world comes into play in the investors in the real world pick companies that have momentum that demonstrate that they can execute execution is everything a and to stand out in a business plan competition more progress than your competitors simple things like having website even if it just says coming soon a working a first pilot completed or actual paying customers will go a way to make you stand out customers using or paying for product is particularly important as this will help unknowns and back up the assumptions in your business plan real world be complete there are some critical things every business must cover make sure that you cover all of these things even briefly there are tons of great sites out there with advice what to include in a business plan so i elaborate but suggest that you find out who the current thought leaders are regards to business plans and make sure covered two to three of the plans i read had critical elements write like a ny times reporter write in clear objective and avoid unsupported claims investors pick teams in which have developed trust this trust begins with the words you put your plan sound like a playground braggart boasting your future billion business instead build your case piece piece in an objective fashion using real data the key claims you make in your plan should be well supported with evidence gathered through experimental learning or market your team investors invest in people not plans plans i read simply listed the names of the people without any bio at all this gave me no chance to get to know team why should i invest in you what makes you positioned for this opportunity showing personality is find mentors to critique and edit your plan there are two types editors you should seek first and most importantly find that has credibility in reviewing business plans and have critique it for content and completeness find someone who hold back on asking the hard questions judges will likely these same weaknesses so knowing these in advance and something about them even if you simply point the weakness out a risk will help inspire further trust that you have things fully through second find someone who can help you writing and tone this

researchers journeyed denmark for the second annual copenhagenomics conference a smorgasbord of genome science and the organizers biopeople and the genomics enlightenment both network organizations should be commended not for putting on such a meeting but also for the release of a stream of videos of the one of the first of the videos to be posted is a talk from mckernan a familiar face among ngs aficionados mckernan was founder of agencourt and one of the architects of what and the genomics enlightenment foundation both organizations came the life technologies solid sequencing with acquisition of ion torrent mckernan sensed it was time a new venture last year he founded a small genomics dedicated to sequencing the cannabis genome which important medical implications for cancer treatment he has joined forces with his brothers at fascinating talk at copenhagenomics sequencing cannabis genome can be viewed in its entirety httpaddr the remaining videos will be posted in the coming httpaddr last edited by ngs leaders at am comments return of finished genomes hybrid sequencing strategy boosts accuracy permanent genomic july kevin davies two new papers in the july issue of the journal biotechnology one from michael schatz and colleagues at cold harbor laboratory the other from a team at pacific biosciences demonstrate the value of combining long but relatively reads from pacific instrument with shorter read lengths from the hybrid error correction approach shows its potential in assembly of a variety of microbial and more complex genomes that of the parrot and could have ramifications comparative genome analyses microbial genome analyses and the of structural it could also provide a timely scientific and commercial boost sequencing platform which is facing competition and striving to allay the perception that its lacks the accuracy of its more established many people hear this raw accuracy figure for pacbio data say can i do anything with the cold spring harbor paper shows you can do some pretty impressive stuff says jonathan bingham product manager informatics this error approach allows the return of the era of finished long reads can be efficiently assembled in combination complementary short reads to produce assemblies not possible says michael schatz a senior author on the cshl when pacbio launched its sequencing platform to fanfare in the sky was the limit the founders executives promised the minute genome by with read lengths and a dazzling interplay of advanced physics not everything went according to plan however like helicos sequencing platform before it there was resistance at forking big bucks for a machine weighing close to metric ton more significantly the stochastic nature sequencing meant that by own admission the past months the accuracy of any single dna read unsatisfactorily around the percent on the business front the company had to ride out an downturn at one point shedding about one third of its workforce founding ceo hugh martin battled multiple myeloma martin was by sequencing veteran michael hunkapiller last year tasked lifting the sagging stock price with the competitive of nanopore technologies looming on the but pacbio did show its stripes last year identifying the strains behind the cholera outbreak in haiti and the ecoli poisoning crisis in germany and a recent software release paves way for the pacbio platform to provide direct detection eventually identification of epigenetic modifications hybrid the idea of marrying long reads with the shorter higher abundance reads produced on an illumina or other platform has been mooted for some time explains with sequencing platforms such as illumina solid and was really cheap to get a draft sequence but very expensive to get finished genome with systems you can get a draft quickly and relatively inexpensively but to close the genome you to go back in and do sanger sequencing pcr and so on a painstaking process the cost compared to generating an illumina genome was about you might spend one lane of illumina a rough draft of a bacterial genome but to get a finished genome had to do of sanger although using slightly different approaches the two new clearly demonstrate the benefit of sequencing the same template dna two platforms and marrying their respective strengths the of pacbio with the higher integral sequencing accuracy the illumina the cshl hybrid error correction approach was developed phillippy and sergey koren national biodefense analysis countermeasures center maryland along with cshl colleagues schatz and dick this mathematical fix released as code produced finished genome for much less money than a sanger finishing says bingham he adds that the ability to produce a composite with accuracy around suggests that high error rates with long reads need not be a barrier to genome the cshl pbcr pacbio corrected reads strategy aligns the illumina reads against the longer read pacbio data trimming correcting the data before taking the consensus of that alignment typically above and develops a finished assembly about the pacbio reads are retained for the final assembly although figure should increase with newer two general approaches have gained traction for de novo genome the olc paradigm a graph is from overlapping sequencing reads and the de bruijn graph the graph is constructed from the authors found that olc assembly approach became more powerful as read lengths whereas the de bruijn method reached a plateau and so built approach around the the best results were obtained using the celera assembler developed eugene myers and colleagues for the human genome project and over and allora the resulting contigs had a median size least double that obtainable with sequencers alone and in cases a the average length of pacbio reads with the latest c released earlier this year is significantly higher than any available platform says bingham on a typical run you can average read lengths of bases on an exponential distribution you go to the tail you get reads at bases the reads obtained by the cshl group were while the chief application of pacbio has largely been in the world the new paper also demonstrates success in assembling the genome as part of the latest assemblathon competition which says provided better assembly than any system alone the group also looked at the corn transcriptome pacbio reads were enough to span entire rna the cshl group did something really amazing they took the assembler and were able to add on this error correction piece so you have it set up and configured easy to take your iilumina data and your pacbio long reads put them into an automated and get a finished genome at the end says indeed the cshl authors predict that the hybrid approach should able to deliver what bingham calls a perfectly structural genome the pacbio strategy described in the accompanying paper chief science officer eric schadt and colleagues begins with assembly based on the data and then uses the pacbio data conjunction with that draft assembly the method was tested in analysis of the cholera the value of these new hybrid approaches extends beyond microbes just for bacteria it scales up to larger genomes bingham for example the new parrot genome assembly is far to that of any previously sequenced bird genome schatz bingham says the two groups have had friendly conversations about is the better approach for doing hybrid de novo genome assembly concedes however that the cshl approach will attract interest it lets users avoid locking up which could happen you were to first assemble with illumina and then add pacbio in approach if the illumina data had and misjoined etc then not be able to undo the error he the error correction step itself require any black magic relatively straightforward says bingham although he notes there are chimeric reads that need to be caught which requires little skill the approach is not just limited to pacbio and data for example it could be applied to pacbio circular reads and the longer bingham is also excited about the potential to combine this with evolving

different posted by ngs leaders at pm comments variants disease and population permanent note we are pleased to share the following from genomena a blog maintained by nathaniel pearson director research at the entry is reposted here with permission janine nathanial pearson may nathaniel pearson three new spotlight a glut of rare variants in our genomes with key insights human history and rarity new papers from teams led by josh akey and novembre and a brief theory paper from alon keinan and prolific andy clark highlight a bounty of rare genetic variants our genomes and point out why we should bolstered by the data from more than million copies individual human genes the growing catalog of such rare variants our recent rampant population growth into more temporal relief and should in the long run help finely trace geographic sojourns of particular copies of human chromosome more importantly however many of those rare variants likely centrally in our these basic insights have been clear to geneticists for a time and great to see them percolate through the lay the new data papers scoured every letter of many genes in thousands people and found a bumper crop of spelling variants that are found in just one or a few of those people the third paper what such findings suggest about precisely how big the human has been over time and roughly what they mean for efforts understand altogether the findings cast such bright light on our origins health because under simple assumptions geneticists can predict often variants that do or greatly alter proteins should pop in a given proportion of people if our ancestors were steady number and if proteins especially important for health those are two big the new data highlight that real patterns of such variant in our genomes drastically flout those null expectations and call sensible attention to rare variants which underlie deviation as we search for the genetic basis of disease specifically the papers all underscore two broad insights that been clear for several o our population has skyrocketed but just for the past few millenia a trend left a strong signature of many young rare variants in our o many of those rare variants may be making us a tippy tree laden with rare the findings in the new papers hinge on a simple insight the widely common a genetic variant is the older it likely is this because old variants have typically been carried down many branches the growing human family tree spreading far and wide on the planet contrast variants that just arose recently are typically confined recently sprouted geographically narrow branches of the while details of very early human population dynamics are hard precisely infer the new data along with much other genetic ancillary historical evidence see keinan and citations for starters suggest that our population has extremely fast in the past few millenia such growth has stretched the human family tree at its tips the young look longer in units of generations than otherwise given how long the trunk and inner branches are and because genetic variants pop up roughly randomly by mutation on the as they grow the long tips of the tree harbor more its total load of mutations than they would have had the tree grown a constant you can picture each such mutation as if it were a little brainstorm the head of the late dr seuss had seuss drawn genomic trees he might have represented each mutation as an kind of fruit confined to the branch big or and including its where the mutation struck many of rife rare variants in our genomes can thus be thought of as fruits each confined to just one or a few twigs amid a great in this light the new papers affirm become clear over the few years as we sequence more and more whole still be finding new human genetic variants for a long time after having sequenced many more of and as long as our population continues to dramatically balloon system out of equilibrium in population genetic terms the tree continue to loosely resemble an inflationary universe its branches speeding apart from each other via new mutations in analogy the genetic counterpart of the that signals expansion is roughly speaking the overall skew in toward rarity of our genetic rare variants in visions of the human family tree tips bent toward our probing grasp newfound fruit may recall the myth of another tree apt that the crop of rare variants in our genomes may include much of fruit of human rare variants are thought to figure centrally in disease for related reasons as seen most such variants are rare they arose recently so had time to spread widely among and young variants by definition withstood natural for such selection often assisted by chance tends to keep variants rare or purge them from the population rare variants by contrast are in principle free to more common though chance often strikes them down that is over time consistently harmful variants tend to especially if the population is big enough to stably harbor a variety of alternative variants meanwhile variants that happen not harm their carriers are free to spread whether by chance or in cases by helping their carriers have more kids than others together these trends mean that a snapshot of the rare variants carry today like a worth of the newest tweets likely enriched for items that will soon be either gone or in a cases more and they help explain why surveys of the common genetic covered by fast cheap snp chip screens rarely offer clear into disease risk for a given stretch of the genome such variants do distinguish big branches of the human family tree from other making them quite informative of ancestry but a consensus emerged that the long tail of human genetic diversity all those variants is where find much of the genetic contribution disease spotting which rare variants harm us however turns out to be proof of take the extreme case of a variant found in just one woman everyone on earth if we split humanity into those who get a disease in life and those who our chosen woman must fall one group or the other and if we look at enough diseases eventually fall into the sick group for at least one of but clearly too far a leap to infer that the unique variant carries made her sick that is the distribution among with and without the disease simply be statistically given how rare it is to meet this inherent challenge to squarely implicating a given variant in a given disease geneticists look to leverage insights if the variant really is too rare to show up on screening of more sick or healthy people and a place the new data are already helping us at knome as we intriguing variants for research clients they next ask how it may affect physiology by altering the amount or chemical makeup of protein encoded by a gene that either harbors the variant itself sits near it in the and next they may look at more people with the disease in and ask whether other rare variants tend to cluster nearby in genomes moreso than other in recent years as detailed data on human genetic variation has started to geneticists have been honing rare variant burden tests to find such regions refining such tests and gathering more and phenotypic data to feed them stands to bring many key into the genetic basis of disease and on a time frame shorter we certainly hope than that needed for natural selection itself to all those harmful variants from the crop of rare variants we a new to thoroughly catalog the rare variants that pepper our genomes course we have to read what dna letters we carry at each site in genome rather than just at those sites already known to vary spelling as in snp the newly published work furthers effort by carefully sifting through particular sets of genes in thousands of people more people than have ever been comprehensively sequenced notably the novembre paper focuses on a few hundred already thought to help govern how the body responds to drugs such genes are actually an intriguing testing ground for notion that rare variants crucially shape not just disease risk other phenotypes outward traits many drugs derive from defense chemicals made by plants and molds organic chemists extraordinaires that our ancestors long eaten breathed and otherwise touched but modern folks have tinkered greatly with such drugs concentrating combining diversifying them in our quest to prevent and cure diseases as many drugs and cocktails thereof are like other facets of overall diets fairly new parts of the human drugs we take are thus exposing even the most common read variants in our genomes to novel regimes of natural selection such drugs work better at particular doses in some people than and such variation may often trace largely to variation in looking ahead intrigued to see whether rare genetic variants out to explain unusual responses to particular drugs as well better as they explain particular diseases or whether such variation in drug response traces largely to variants in our tall trees the diversity an intriguing tidbit in the akey paper is a spatial contour overall genetic diversity across thousands of genes in our plotting the classic measure of nucleotide diversity that how often two randomly chosen chromosomal copies of a genome differ in spelling jacob tennessen et predictably found the strongest peak in diversity in the hla cluster on chromosome expressed on the surface of immune cells these genes work in large part to help us fight infection job thought to be well served by great genetic diversity within genome which presumedly helps its carrier respond to many kinds byzantine in its sequence variation hla turns out to play functional roles in mate choice drug response and diseases multiple sclerosis to narcolepsy notably women and other female apes likely pick their mates in part and unconsciously by they smell thanks partly to what versions of hla they and suitors carry such preferences are thought to help preserve variation longer here than elsewhere in the genome so well in that your copies of some hla genes more closely resemble some copies than some other copiesand those hla are likewise closer to yours than to each essentially even the inner branches of the family tree of this part the genome are incredibly long stretching back generations than is typical as see in a coming post the depth of the tree for a given part of the genome can be thought of as rough proxy for how big the ancestral population for that part of genome has over time tended to other peaks in genetic diversity lower than hla but still include odorant receptor and keratin genes which are widely presumed to accumulate functionally variation reflecting less stringent evolutionary constraint in than in some other mammals strikingly however the akey group found that another immune response gene marks a peak genetic diversity roughly as tall as that of the much better known cluster be intriguing to learn more about what does our bodies and whether its remarkable diversity reflects importance or stay tuned on that front as more of us are sequenced and learn much more about which of our variants among the ones and the newly commonplace rare ones matter most and how of what we learn will speak directly to the pending challenges genomically personalized medicine as framed in fervent discussion another recent paper both at large and on httpaddr estimates typically ignore any complications mating variation in mutation rate and so forth but quite moreover the history of human population change has of varied in space among regional as well as over notably the new papers suggest that such variation may be fairly in the grand scheme dwarfed by the remarkable overall recent and keinan and clark note that sample sizes in particular may roughly as much noise to the picture as do real underlying ultimately the length of these twigs tracks how long many chosen pairs of extant copies of our chromosomes have descended separate in the end you likely harbor a dozen or so brand new genetic that arose by mutation only in you but you also likely harbor of other very rare variants that til we sequence your genome have never been spotted in anyone note that this mean that no one with harmful variants has after all everyone carries some such variants and people breeding just fine rather because a given variant can be independently of other variants in the same genome and may wreak only in combination with another copy of itself or some variant people simply tend to have more kids who inherit more of healthier alternative variants than kids who inherit more copies harmful ones moreover much of the natural selection in likely happens beyond our view before pregnancy begins when early embryos fail to implant and thrive in the last edited by ngs leaders at pm comments elusive appeal of exome permanent note we are pleased to share an article submitted by rosenfeld phd jeffrey is a bioinformatics scientist in the of high performance and research computing at the university medicine and dentistry of new jersey umdnj and a research in the division of invertebrate zoology at the american museum natural rosenfeld may jeffey rosenfeld in the past few years prices of sequencing have plummeted and now for a few thousand the complete sequence of an individual can be obtained even so scientists have opted to sequence just the exome coding regions of individual and to ignore the rest of the genome this focus on exome has some justification but i think that it is shortsighted despite the higher cost the sequencing of a complete genome is valuable even if that means sequencing fewer the supporters of exome sequencing generally make the following to justify their a the sequencing of an exome is much cheaper than the sequencing of genome it must be substantially cheaper to sequence of the than the whole b we understand how to interpret variants therefore we should limit our sequencing to genes that are c variants that are associated with a genetic disease are more to be found in a coding region since they directly alter the of a i am not going to deny that there is some validity to these points i think that they outweigh the shortcomings of exome and the benefits of whole genome sequencing that i will outline i understand that this is a contentious issue and i welcome comments whether you agree or disagree with my the first reason the people generally look to exome sequencing is of cost intuitively the sequencing of of the genome the should be cheaper than sequencing the entire genome while this true the price differential is nowhere near and is closer to or depending upon how the costs of the sequencing is currently a whole genome costs and an exome costs are these prices so close to each other the answer is that the reagent cost of running the sequencer is not the only factor in cost of a genome or an exome for either type of experiment prep is required along with the costs associated with setting up sequencing run of any size for an exome there is the additional of purchasing the selection kit which allow one to extract the sequences from raw dna either using a microarray or in solution kit can cost several hundred dollars and is therefore a portion of the cost of exome because of the lack of strong cost differential the economic of favoring exome sequencing is not very strong for the same amount funding a researcher would need to choose between say exomes genomes while samples are obviously better than this is a great differential it is much less than the differential one would naively think of concerning the price of genome and sequences an additional factor affecting the cost of exome is the time required to perform the hybridization for the protocol hours of time are required for hybridization and are required for the agilent approach these times add a delay into time taken from sample to sequence which may be problematic clinical applications as an example the ion torrent machine is pitched as a tool for rapid sequencing that will produce results in single day when an exome is targeted using agilent or nimblegen will grow to at least or days of exome the definition of an exome is somewhat elusive it can refer a all of coding exons of the b a microrna c a utr and utr d unannotated transcripts that have been discovered in experiments or from the encode e all functional portions of the these five definitions will include very different portions of genome and some of them such as e are difficult to define in and themselves it has been shown in multiple studies that there transcription along substantial portions of the genome should all these regions be considered part of the exome in general these are included in the exome kits since their inclusion would push the size the exome much closer to that of a genome and any potential from the lesser amount of sequencing will decrease instead the is generally limited to coding genes with some level of along with micrornas and to some extent each of the different vendors that produce exome kits have different approaches to defining the exome a recent httpaddr the exome selection offering from the three main players in the agilent nimblegen and exome this figure gives a great comparison of the different firstly the approaches to selecting the exome sequence nimblegen uses overlapping dna baits agilent uses rna baits which distinct but contiguous and illumina uses distinct dna baits that not contiguous and contain breaks of sequence because this nimblegen contains many times the number of probes as the two technologies the rest of the figure shows venn illustrating the overlap between the targeted regions for different defintions of human genes refseq and ensembl there substantial agreement between the technologies as indicated by the and of sequence that they all cover the biggest discrepancy with regard to utr regions where illumina has mb that are from the other two a different technique to assess coverage is to look at the amount the exome target from a particular kit that is covered at a threshold to make a confident call of a variant for many scientists threshold of x coverage is required to trust a variant derived an exome sequence any loci with lesser amounts of coverage ignored since the general sequencing coverage for an exome is x theory it should be no problem to achieve x coverage of the targeted region in practice this is not the case for three firstly exome sequencing as with all sequencing produces reads in statistical distribution and not evenly along the genome some regions are going to have their dna sequenced more often and have a higher number of reads this idea forms the basis of the statistics that are used for designing projects the second reason for variation in coverage is that some the baits used for selecting the exomic dna will have a higher than other baits mainly due to gc content those probes with affinity for their targets will produce greater amounts of dna the final concern is due to the repetitive nature of the the selection probes need to target a unique location in the genome ensure that they are truly obtaining the dna that they intend select if the targeted region is repeated in the genome then from all of matching regions will be equally selected many human share domains with other proteins and any shared sequences cannot targetted this is an equivalent problem to the unique mapping sequencing reads which is a big concern in the use of short reads any reads that map to more than one location of the cannot be uniquely placed and are generally these concerns are illustrated in this figure from agilent their sureselect exome sequencing this is an old figure but i think that while the numbers might changed a bit the overall message remains the read depth is variable and you do not achieve anything close to coverage of exome while accurate data is available for of the exome depth x this also means that of the exome is missed in odds this means that for a disease study where an exomic variant with the disease there is a chance of not having the included in the data a researcher could conclude that there is coding variant associated with their disorder when in actuality it just that it fell into the that was missed an error level of is not trivial and cannot be lightly whole when a whole genome is sequenced many of the issues regarding sequencing are not relevant there is no need to buy a kit or to wait for the kit to hybridize while there are biases as there are in any sequencing experiment there are not additional biases introduced from the exome selection overall is probably the standard error in sequencing giving a level of but the biggest gain from a sequencing is that the genome excluding some unclonable regions is obtained if one wants focus on the exome because it is easier to understand and they can easily filter out the portions of the genome obtain an in silico exome this is an easy action to perform and if positive result is not found in the exome then you already have rest of the genome sequenced to begin looking for an intronic related to splicing or a promoter or enhancer variant in traditional exome experiment this is not possible if no variant found in the exome then there is no result and one needs to go and sequence the whole genome again from to give a picture of the fraction of disease associated variants are coding or i looked at the ucsc collection of studies the current list contains unique snps loci that identified as part of a gwas study of these snps of are not within coding genes thus more than half of the important genomic variants are not in coding regions and would not covered by exomes some of these snps may be in utrs or rnas which are targeted by some of the i see this as a betting situation would you rather spend have a chance of getting the answer of spend and have a chance of getting the answer i think that the genome is more reasonable just because we understand does not mean that we can or should ignore it as scientists we an obligation to try our best to investigate human disease and not only focus on things that are easy to as a final point there has been some recent talk concerning that are only found from exome sequencing and not genome these results are not a fair comparison of apples to apples the are generally sequenced at x coverage and the genomes are at x coverage for the specific variants under discussion sequencing coverage is required to identify them from any this x coverage could have been of just the exome or the genome if the whole genome were sequenced to x for a comparison then i am confident that there would not have been advantage for the exome over the posted by ngs leaders at pm comments cancers are the

nathaniel pearson in time finer data and models will test the specific claims of a widely discussed paper by bert vogelstein and colleagues on the prospect genomic risk prediction though the of studies has taken some heat for repackaging longstanding about heritability the fuss over it has usefully underscored complexities of disease and healthcare and thoughtful responses the paper have made clearer to the public that few geneticists the zealous determinists of caricature rather we tend to grasp causal basis of disease and other phenotypes with inclusive but while the dialog may have enlightened many both the paper and critiques have largely missed two pertinent in the world of genetic risk cancers are big inasmuch they prove some underlying and in the context of the paper itself these points nestle into in research twins with tumors are no longer really to see why and fold this point into the wider discourse on personalized healthcare peer briefly through the of cancer gemini cancer and genomic as noted the new paper aimed to summarize what studies of say about how well our genomes alone may predict what diseases get the premise of course is that twins from the same fertilized resemble live runs of a telling thought experiment if you and genome lived twice would you get the same the basic answer has long been clear twins always get sick same way but vogelstein and colleagues reasonably asked particular common adult diseases how often they sensibly they reviewed available twin data for several complex interrelated epidemic killers such as heart diabetes and stroke to boot they also combed the on pregnancy complications an intriguing evolutionary nexus health some nerve and autoimmune diseases and mysterious ailments like chronic fatigue and irritable but nine of the diseases they surveyed the bulk class were cancers and this choice sapped any suspense their findings for while cancers indeed kill many people so study they are long known to be far less heritable that is show a smaller portion of cases running in families than many grave diseases as vogelstein a renowned cancer researcher knows loading a heritability survey with cancers is like padding russian presidential ballot with token dissidents to be fair the authors likely set out to mislead after they could only survey available studies of twins and a big of cancers was ripe to include in the end it supplied all their on the while that study did find some evidence of heritability in cancers it concluded that such heritability little role in most cases bolstering the bottom in the grand scheme cancers rarely run in where the authors be excused so easily is in a hyping their findings as novel while b burying this key grain salt far from headlines and press releases in a brief aside near end of the for diseases with a lower heritable component such as most forms cancer based genetic tests will be even which any clinical geneticist could have told you thirty years and unsurprisingly all nine surveyed cancers in survey deemed less genetically predictable heritable than the other studied nonetheless any oncologist will tell you that cancers quintessentially genetic diseases as see they require are even defined by genomes gone indeed some of the most widely genetic risk underlie rare familial forms of breast and colon cancer whole genome interpretation is finding its first vital clinical in treating tumors along with sick so what gives how can cancers be intrinsically genetic yet so hard predict from our the answer it turns out is that it matters which genomes we the hive to understand peculiar nature as a genetic disease picture your bodyas a colony of bear with me here both entities you and the swarm ultimately teeming masses of individuals cells or bees most of work hard to help just a few of their kind eggs or sperm or queen and few males breed on their in this view the two basic kinds of cells in your body which biologists also call the germline and somatic cells respectively resemble a bee two main castes breeders in a sexual organism like you somatic cells kaleidoscopically in form embodying the many specialized tissues that help a body thrive from moment to moment gametes by specialize mainly in storing dna for coming generations and as slow costly eggs or small fast cheap sperm in finding a gamete to merge in most animals the cells that become the germline split from cells very early in embryonic development as with bee royalty nearly impossible for a somatic commoner to infiltrate reproductively privileged ranks while details prompt debate natural selection is thought to driven the emergence of the and distinctions and in both cases to have brokered a lasting compact between the two kinds of in this contract a somatic cell in your hand like a dutiful bee effectively says to your cousins if you spread our shared genes give my life to help count on me to build sturdy shelter find good food fend attackers write honeyed words to entice a mate and care tenderly the children that come after you do the rest and send our seen in this hobbesian light a tumor is effectively a mutiny somatic cells who break that evolutionary covenant with their cousins a budding tumor cell effectively says no i and die for other cells reproduce myself and proliferating a disease of crucially the cellular treachery of each cancer case typically to one or more sudden changes mutations in the genome of somatic cell the mutations in question may be slight say miscopying of one dna letter from the parent genome or they be drastic as when a rogue gamma ray shatters a whole chromosome the latter case the cell may in mending the resulting fragments dna inadvertently scramble whether slightly or severely altering dna sequence the mutations turn cells into tumors tend to do so in particular ways they either throw or freeze stuck one or more functional switches the budding tumor genome switches that had til then governed the reproduction of that immediate ancestors their proliferation to the overall best interests of the the switches in question are often genes that govern a whether a cell divides or instead takes a form b how the cell exchanges signals other cells eg halting growth at the touch of a neighboring or telling that neighbor to build more blood vessels to bring food and oxygen in some cases the key switch may govern how well cell corrects dna copying errors one mutation in such a gene may spark many more some of which eventually knock out other switches more directly reined in the in the end a tumor grows unchecked thanks directly to one or newly arisen genetic variants that distinguish it from other cells the same body importantly such cellular mutinies are with exceptions typically doomed in their greed for resources rebelling cells weaken the body overall and with no way to sink with the ship that sui all this ultimately means that tumors grow spread kill specifically because their genomes differ from other genomes such cancers are not just genetic in origin but break a assumption underlying paper that monozygotic twins genetically that is as soon as a person is diagnosed with a tumor all premised on her genetic identity or even near identity to a are off not only do billions of her cells now differ from those of her twin but they differ in ways that are definition biologically important that is the distinctive variants in question drastically change the way that cells letting them divide in this sense a tumor genetically distinguishes its host of whom is intrinsically part from other people de facto much as genetic variants may distinguish someone with a strongly disease from other people notably this insight tempers expectation that the twin should get the same disease cancer driven by genetic variants that the twin likely and it underscores the uniformitarian rule that cancers in their heritability seem at first to violate in diseases of all genomic differences tumor genomes noisy mixed the first active clinical uses of whole genome sequencing have been pediatrics and oncology and this makes sense in bluntly formal sick kids and tumors are both masses of cells one beloved the loathed that are growing awry and both growing as too fast for us to wait for sequencing to get cheaper or for knowledge to get deeper sequence now if we can afford to order to gain some foothold into the medical mystery at for tumors in particular we hope that sequencing the tumor importantly healthy tissue for comparison will reveal key clues to how it arose grows spreads and might be slowed killed alas that turns out to be hard to do for three key first as noted tumor genomes are pocked by mutation small changes often abound hiding a few functionally important ones drivers in a cacophony of incidental noise and bigger scales long segments of chromosomes are often missing or scrambled such rampant genetic variation is not just to functionally interpret but also makes it hard to draw an picture of the genome in the first place why it turns out that computer algorithms used in modern sequencing work poorly for that differ greatly from the standard reference genome snippets of raw sequence data that match up well to that like puzzle pieces that closely match the picture on the are hard to correctly place moreover tracts of dna letters appear in multiple spots in a genome like uniform fenceposts in farmscape puzzle are especially hard to accurately sequence acute challenge in tumors where rampant mutational copying and pasting turns the genome into a bewildering house of second each tumor actually harbors not one but a mix of such genomes often with cell genomes inadvertently mixed while a tumor is indeed a clump of closely related cells distinctively share particular variants also a population genetically varied cell lines each effectively striving to grow than the others thanks to its own secondary stock of relevant variants but because sequencing today requires pooling cells genetic variation in the tumor tends to get homogenized as in a blender an important variant carried only in a few cells may be prominent enough to show up in the final reckoning of a tumor genome third the mix of genomes in the tumor evolves partly in response treatment thus we may want to track how treating the tumor with particular regimen kills of some cell lines in the tumor while other lines by chance resistant to the treatment spread quickly best characterize and treat a tumor we might want to see a rather than just a snapshot of its mix of genomes letting us how they change in response to treatment but doing so is for foregoing reasons tough and will be until we can sequence cells at a time for less money and with longer snippets of sequence analogous to bigger puzzle pieces that can be more pieced together to get the whole moving on a late summer afternoon when i was six my mom came to my room next to me and showed me fresh bruises on her arms and legs with determined nonchalance she trained a young attention to a moment of each in her skin was i learned real bloodshed from a below in the marrow of her bones delinquent cells were wrecking the nurseries of sticky platelets that she needed to small everyday blood vessel leaks the bruises were collateral from that mutiny her own cells betraying her and those she she sought treatment but leukemia wore her down quickly halloween night muted by breathing tubes in intensive care she welcome my visit only with a tiny nod and a waiting cup of candy died a few days later at my classmates struggling comprehend from afar sketched colorful cards of condolence that still writing today on her birthday older than she got to be reading long before paper taught me that leukemia little heritability yet i still watch for bruisesand admit to tinge of affirmed relief that among the diseases that the assayed for genetic predictability leukemia came in but the comfort is cold cancers remain an especially vexing kind plague sprung from our own selves tumors are in the terms something like evil conjoined twins growing relentlessly changing they cloak genomic secrets in genomic smoke and evade harshest treatments they are the last at a recent conference i listened to washington elaine mardis explain how she and her colleagues are characterizing the genomes of thousands of tumors their yeoman work building a broadly useful critical mass of detailed knowledge about tumors arise grow and spread but their findings are also real doctors and patients today choose treatments that lengthen and lessen after talk i told her how touched i am not just by her work itself but to know that wash u where my mom earned phd and barnes

individuated genome data to help people live looking ahead those of us lucky enough to afford good healthcare will likely be talking a lot about tumor genomes with our families friends in coming decades relevant insights will likely guide choices for many of us and those we see how soon other major adult diseases think of surveyed by vogelstein et al but also of liver and kidney mental illnesses breathing problems asthma respiratory infections bone diseases etc likewise become more amenable personal genomic insights first for diagnosis and in the long for prognosis too to those twin in bees as well as ants and termites this compact is thought to reinforced by the fact that a queen and her worker sister may especially closely related often moreso than either would be to own daughter this odd twist of kinship follows from male bees just one copy of each chromosome having hatched from eggs while females have two hatching from fertilized as result bee full sisters share on average of their with each other while mothers and daughters share just in a real hive the numbers are complicated by many pairs of being just with different but that turns out to matter much the strong social contract of eusociality can mathematically understood even without the kinship bee sisters as in many personified examples of rivalry between organisms tumor effective strategy is not conscious but rather mathematical truism that is cells in which a chance mutation the web of reproductive constraint that natural selection has will at least in the short term tend to outgrow neighboring importantly a person may be born with at least one such switch already thrown this scenario underlies rare cases of familial cancer risk cancer can then strike as soon as a second a copy of the same gene or another gene is randomly thrown by new people born with one broken copy of the cell gene for example tend to eventually get tumors in both eyes in cases their working second copy of rb tends to eventually mutate one of the cells of the retina of eye leading to a first tumor later a second such mutation may a retinal cell in the other eye spawning a tumor there thus even in rare forms of cancers that run in families getting tumor requires some new mutation in a somatic cell and that may in turn be driven by some environmental factor such radiation toxins or even infectious germs highlighting that genetic and environmental factors are key to understanding cancers just as in other one tumor that beat the odds living on beyond its original belonged to american henrietta lacks as detailed in compelling personal and cellular biography in doctor took cells without her consent from the ovarian that was killing her and grew them in dishes though born in and scientific misconduct those cells nonetheless proved resilient in laboratory culture and have since spread worldwide as key resource for six decades of biomedical another tumor that slipped the mortal coil of its origins is contagious facial cancer that plagues tasmanian devils the of a fascinating recent paper and some rare cancers germline rather than somatic cells may manage to make gametes enough to transmit themselves rampant cell growth and all coming of course even monozygotic twins without tumors genetically identical the great size and the generations of cell division needed to build the cells in their bodies nearly assure that no single cell in either is genetically identical to the fertilized egg from which they came much less to a typical cell pulled from the other but tumors flout the genetic identity assumption of twin studies more severely the many cells that make up a tumor tend to especially closely related to each other thanks to their recent spurt thus the newly arisen genetic variants that the share and that distinguish them from other cells in the body and moreso from cells of the other twin thanks to the extra rounds of division that separate the two cell lineages in question especially common among the cells of the person overall as such if think of a genome as comprising at each site a weighted of the genotypes of all her cells then a tumor makes her genetically distinctive even beyond the prospect that differences may be more functionally important in tumors than in kinds of last edited by ngs leaders at pm comments competition to

permission march dean gaalaas ceo edgebio i attended the genome meeting last week in sydney australia due to our with the x prize it was my first time at the meeting and i came very impressed at the level of sequencing being presented during talks many of the talks led off by john talk on genomics and were highlighted by michael talk on using profiling for assessing disease risk and heath states through all the talks a central theme emerged in my eyes that the would lead to widespread adoption of ngs as a clinical diagnostic much has been written and said about the promise of genomics and its impact on personalized medicine however that is not the of this spot i would prefer to assess the merits of the premise the cost alone will lead to rapid adoption sequencing as a to me this seems like an overly simplistic view of what is needed bring ngs to the clinic attended many talks over the past years and most believe that sequencing is essential to learn more complex diseases such as cancer and neurological disorders this an interesting parallel to sequencing as a species we humans drawn to the simplistic view of cause and effect in the case of health we tend to think that a change in one gene will cause a state and that by fixing this one gene through a variety of we can cure that disease state however we know this not to be for a majority of when it comes to the adoption of ngs i believe we are falling prey this overly simplistic model the current thought is if we can make sequencing more affordable like the genome that adoption curve will start to go asymptotic to me it seems getting ngs into the clinic as a matter of standard of care will much more complex yes cost plays an enormous role and is a enough starting point but there are many more factors that need to considered the factor that is most intriguing to me and the one have heard least about is how do we get insurers to in australia many of my international colleagues posited that sequencing were to only cost usd that many would turn to it an out of pocket expense as this is a matter of routine for outside of the us fair enough but what will sequencing your once tell you about your disease state presumably you are paying money out of pocket because you suffer at the time from a ailment michael talk focused on looking at his genome several time points referencing his genome at a baseline healthy state versus disease state rhinovirus and so on to me this seems like a very assessment on how to use sequencing as a diagnostic to monitor in the genome over the lifespan of a patient this means having genome sequenced multiple times which makes it doubtful that would be willing to pay as many times as certainly in the us few if any are willing to pay medical expenses so will the genome cause insurers to line to reimburse my thought is no they rush to reimburse even it were per genome the health industry in the us tends to move what could best be described as a gingerly pace standard of care routinely cited and standard of care tends not to change in with discovery or technological advances no it tends to change on legal risk and cost tort reform in the health industry is a cause of mine but not the focus of this post so just look insurers are very black and white when it comes to reimbursement reimbursing for a test will save them money over what is available they can be convinced to change consider if you will is needed to convince insurers that this will indeed save them money reasonable scenario may look like this insurers actuarial tables they have reams of data to support them say that a typical head for insured will stay with the insurance company for an average of years and generate of revenue for the insurance company that lifespan what needs to be shown is that by leveraging ngs as matter of standard of care the amount of revenue generated per head greater than a very simplistic model to be sure but serve to illustrate the point clearly a study could be designed to this correct certainly but how much power would a study like need over how long of a time i came away from the human genome meeting more excited than ever some of the groundbreaking research being done across the globe ngs technology now if we could just match it with research on the cost impact of leveraging ngs in the clinic we will much closer to the promise that the genome

generation comments feed nih extramural nexus availability for last nih regional seminar in submitting tracking administrative supplement requests electronically distribution of nih principal investigators and medical school oer skip to rock rock helping connect you with the nih commitment to supporting the next posted on february by sally talked to you over the past year on many aspects of the research pipeline but one issue the plight of the early researcher has been front and center almost from the first day joined nih over a long period of time nih has made a concerted to make sure that faculty members in their early careers have a chance when they compete against more established investigators if enjoy history a complete description of our programs starting is available on our over the past three decades seen profound shifts in the age at which a principal investigator receives their first the period from to the average age increased nearly years per year since that time the average age at first r award leveled off near for phds it is higher for researchers with an or an shows the average age of investigators at the time of first steadily increasing from to in more recent years our new investigator new to nih policies shifted to numerical targets and you can see a increase of new r investigators beginning in by proportion of new investigators increased to approximately of all competing replicating entry rates not seen since imposition of numerical targets appears to have had little effect the average age at which a new investigator receives their first however in order to encourage earlier transition to independence nih initiated the early stage investigator policy for submitted for funding in fiscal year early stage are defined as being within ten years of completing their degree or their medical number of new and experienced investigators on competing r showing the percent new fall from approximately in to in the early our current policy requires that approximately half of all investigators are early stage investigators but so far seen decrease in the age at entry maybe it is too early to expect impact also made one additional change in the new policy rather than using numerical targets set targets based success rates the success rate for investigators submitting a new application should be the same whether they are new or investigators current policies related to new investigators described on the financial operations webpage note that some the policies are currently being updated for fiscal we believe it is important to continually refresh the pool of scientists and to give them an opportunity to manage their own while they are still relatively young we also believe in the results of our efforts so we are analyzing the outcomes of the new investigator policies for example how successful are new investigators after they get their first award and has that as we fund more of these researchers so as always stay this entry was posted in rock talk bookmark the submitting and tracking administrative supplement age distribution of nih principal investigators and medical faculty responses to our commitment to supporting the next peter doris february at currnet nih policy does not appear to address the question of why younger investigators are not as competitive they used to be rather it distorts competition to achieve desired policy outcome however this does not in fact alter competitiveness of young investigators therefore i expect that current policy will do nothing to the future competitiveness of younger ivestigators it may lessen it as these now successful young come up for competitive continuation the traits that contributed their lack of prior competitiveness have not been identified addressed and they can be expected to fail at higher rates comparably aged investigators who were not provided such because they are now older the effect will be that the average of successful funding would continue to if the proposition that it is desirable to have higher rates among younger investigators is valid not much data on then what is needed is a means to increase competitiveness in investigators one way would be to fully understand what has to this increase in age at first award and to determine there is a way to increase competitiveness for example educational opportunity remedial training the creation incentives to allow young investigators to advance their competitiveness alternatively funding policy could be applied in a way specifically seeks to foster the skills that lead to success competition for example a funding mechanism could be created is specifically directed towards young investigators so that compete against each other success is not the desired excellence is a mechanism to create smaller awards that limited to younger investigators in which they compete with another might assist in developing the skills required to competitive it would also assist in ensuring that we make young scientists better competitors rather than simply give them hand out at the expense of better work from older hot debate what do you think thumb up thumb down drugmonkey february at all this effort and attention out of order pickupsand managed is to stop the increasing trend seriously like or dislike thumb up thumb down bh march at look at the green line in figure like or dislike thumb up thumb down happycamper february at the increase in age for first time awardees is also likely to a reduced number of available independent positions extended or additional postdoctoral fellowships the number of positions has not kept pace with the rate at which young are generated as each mentor produce several to tens postdoctoral perhaps being more stringent with to the number of phds produced and proper guidance for those possess the aptitude and willingness to pursue an academic should be considered right now the emphasis on increasing maintaining a certain level of new scientists seems out of why should every effort be made to give a new investigator advantage when they will soon be facing pay lines of less than percent right now the model appears to be help the next generation of scientists then we will pull the rug from under them when they are i skeptical that such a system will ever be able to adjust levels to a more sustainable level that matches the economic realities of funding biological science in this like or dislike thumb up thumb down ian davis february at this is so on the money i think in some ways the transition is not to first r where the eis is of some help but to first renewal when newer are thrown to the sharks the expectation that a researcher with one r can compete on a level playing with a senior pi with is just ludicrous especially some senior reviewers seem to take the view that a senior pi should get funded even if they write a lousy because they know what they are doing so will not waste money i have seen this happen the reality should be senior pis should be held to a higher standard than junior colleagues finally to say that a leveling off of of first r is an improvement is ridiculous we have spend to years to even have a shot at successful grant aand even that assumes that our own work and ideas are viewed as coming from us rather than mentors especially if we were recipients of training the system is broken at the very least there should be upper age limit on applications so that faculty who have retired years ago are not taking funding away junior pis maybe that way we wont have to wait until middle age to have any chance at all this site seems to pure like or dislike thumb up thumb down o mat february at the hardest transition is not to first r where the categorization is of some help but to first renewal newer investigators are thrown to the this is ridiculous those people have an interval of level funding to generate data publications staff and to generally demonstrate accomplishment of the potential for accomplishment they are better off than newcomers even with the esi hot debate what do you think thumb up thumb down o dana march at most of us in research and i think even at the nih the first renewal for new investigators is the bottleneck the impression i get is that if they enough early stage investigators a few will survive get their renewal survival of the fittest luckiest those with the best like or dislike thumb up thumb down anon february at this data is and should be horrifying the trend line may leveling off simply because by age the new investigators falling out of the applicant pool do the math a year enters graduate school graduates at age completes a postdoc age without a major grant they would have be tenure by age if not sooner therefore it is likely that new policies have nothing to do with the observed like or dislike thumb up thumb down clayton wiley february at the leveling off is while it could be interpreted as improvement of a trend i that it really simply marks a natural ceiling by the age of you are not funded you are not in the game this says much our training programs and the need to expedite the like or dislike thumb up thumb down experienced pi february at you are completely correct peter doris if the kids these days to be nih funded investigators they should compete fairly just we did heck in my day if someone was still mucking around in postdoc for more than yrs they going to make it should return to those days and only give appointments to those can successfully compete within two years of the phd that make it clear we only want the hot debate what do you think thumb up thumb down ian davis february at i really hope this is like or dislike thumb up thumb down tommyo february at heck in your day the payline was with submissions more if you changed the i too seriously hope comments are ment to be like or dislike thumb up thumb down o tcgirl march at excellent point and i would love to the see data against historic paylines eg in was tile today tile what was the payline like or dislike thumb up thumb down divaker february at it may be worthwhile to look at the data concerning r that allowed early stage investigators to compete in a pool based on the data when this grant mechanism was few years ago it was evident that the mechanism was not successful because less than investigators were able successfully compete for an r award any like or dislike thumb up thumb down peter doris february at data is never horrifying only the conclusions that lead from can be do you reach horrifying conclusions from this if so would you advance the discussion by expressing conclusions and the thoughts that lead from the data to like or dislike thumb up thumb down pingback updating the age of first nih r award flatlining bashir february at be very curious to see the data for k like or dislike thumb up thumb down by of and february at the data shown above is interesting and coupled with dr more recent posts httpaddr suggest to that the nih has a challenge on their hands if unaddressed may result in a phenomena for biomedical sciences one of the primary challenges that the faces is how to convert those bright young into successful pis that help to uncover powerful new and mechanisms that will ultimate lead to better therapies cures for diseases that negatively impact human health this has recently been discussed wonderfully in a commentary in nature httpaddr i recently attended a friday evening meeting at my whereby a of a highly interdisciplinary biomedical lectured to an audience that included graduate medical students as well as a diverse faculty he showed a interesting figure that will be published in his book chapter of which i plan to post that data here when it becomes the figure he presented demonstrated that in when of pis were years of age and httpaddr the of publications in the under discussion based on the actual impact of translating basic science to bedside therapeutics was high this associated with a low level of publications in this area published in very prestigious journals in when he showed the data for a whereby pis were years of age or younger there was explosion of articles in the field yet the number of that actually had was the exact until nih changes its policies of promoting quantity over it will not matter how they support the younger generation younger generation is now being raised by an increasingly cohort that understands to maintain or increase their status publishing as much as possible is required regardless the quality this policy will leave a lasting legacy of science and pointless investigation and is a waste like or dislike thumb up thumb down anonymous march at in response to and what world do you live in yes if nih were still at the comfortable nearly that they were when may have in the field or of the number of phd faculty available ratio was what is used to be in day then i would potentially support your heartless and stance but things have changed dramatically not just in but in our global economy and as a result in our very structure for example i would love to know how much real time actually spent taking care of your home and kids if you even today this is the reality of most young and are often couples who equally in responsibilities and are facing nih paylines and such a glutted job market there are about applicants for every piddly little position that is posted so unless people like you are willing limit the amount of nih grants that you receive say no more active at a time or a center plus r you essentially mandate the systematic genocide of the scientist that is in the pipeline ian is to r renewal is not only unprotected there are no nih to favor our apps or to award them with more generous like the new investigators but the most likely where massive hemorrhaging from the pipeline will take place is the use of supporting new and investigators is years alter you will just turn your back on us and let us flow of the like or dislike thumb up thumb down nrs march at this is well said when established investigators have it is ridiculous how can you justify grants f your total is only when a new investigator submits a grant ith time we ridiculed at the study these established investigators survive by haveing postdocs there are instances where the postdocs do not good recommendation from these nih should limit the number actve grants to if nih this then may be then the best new investigator will bring back the r and award incentive grants to investigators who publish in high impact like or dislike thumb up thumb down investigator march at the implications of this policy are so obviously bad for investigators i understand why no one has pointed it out obvious to make the argument simple say new investigators get a grant at thus established investigators are those aged assume a career until a year investigator period new investigators are getting about new grants but only cover about of a career years out on top of this senior investigators typically established more lines of research and can therefore on manage more grant funds easier and more efficiently so the is to force out mid and investigators investigators are in for a big crash this is a bubble pure simple what is the point of funding a lab for years and pulling out the rug after tenure nih administration has become bad as our congressional leaders just kick the can down the and hope it gets better the fundamental problem here is the economic law of supply and demand either you increase the funds the pool or you decrease the number of trainees the system like or dislike thumb up thumb down frederick sachs march at the nih has embarked on a path to remove new investigators form competition of established investigators maybe they it if a young investigator applies for a grant and the revision is not funded they are added to a tsa type list applicants needing extra screening the screening is automated and the result is that these applicants o applicants must write a grant in a new research area using techniques and preparations this new unscientific screen to last for the lifetime of the investigator an nih guideline what is a sufficiently different grant says by example that applicant unfunded for work on a transgenic mouse should preparations to a new investigator is generally trained in a specific area so the nih text algorithm says the new application is says too like the previous one read common words the applicant must a new field with different words and then do some experiments generate preliminary data to show that they are competent in new field and then write a new application and wait six months see if it was sufficiently different and then if they are they might get it reviewed with chance of failure if it scientifically reviewed and not funded they then are added to tsa type list for any new application to be checked against previous thought streamswhy might a competant new applicant for some other kind of all that effort was in tghe name of saving a reviewer from to examine a third or fourth revision it takes a reviewer only a couple hours to compare a new revision to previous application it takes an applicant at least six months learn a new field and write a thought out application it is of the nih to subject an applicant to that has the nih checked the accuracy of grant differences by funded grants from the same lab through the same algorithms are positive that no one has more than one funded grant on a topic if the nih has the data the applicants should should see so they can look at the database and see how to modify proposals to be like funded ones at minimum the nih should have preproposal system so that an applicant can submit specific and an abstract and get an opinion that the changes are adequate guarantee a scientific review before they take the time do write new application and do the preliminary unfunded it is a rare personality that will stay in a grantee position treated so rudely we all know that nobel prizes read new ideas went to investigators whose key work took place as investigators if the nih wants to keep sending their money traditionally funded geezers they should expect no new ideas the tiny drug pipeline suggests they have like or dislike thumb up thumb down struggling too march at all this focus on new investigators is misplaced there is reason to artificially increase the pool of academic into a system that is unsustainable the right number will be to get through on their own without special favors this just resources away from other investigators that already significant investment by nih in model systems and results nih wasting two pots of money one on new investigators that will be able to compete later and all the past investment spent established investigators that will be pushed out to make room review should be equal for all some new investigators will get some old will be pushed out but it will be on merit not because some artificial quota set up by like or dislike thumb up thumb down kope march at what is the goal of nih to reduce the age of first grant improve the diversity and energy of new research to increase likelihood of success for early career scientists if we want change something other than a metric there needs to be a shift that includes both nih and the universities dollar buildings justified with the belief that new research space will be filled with pis who will bring in money to cover their labs their salaries their assistants and the indirects to pay off the loans for the as long as universities look at pis as the university will focus on recruiting only pis with like or dislike thumb up thumb down bellur march at i think it is terribly important to define the purpose of funding is it to advance biomedical knowledge and innovation or to facilitate career development if it is then i fail to see why demographics should be of any concern if is the later then the nih should come up with a two or three system to accomplish its please define what is the central like or dislike thumb up thumb down young female investigator march at be interested to see this data split by like or dislike thumb up thumb down established investigator march at in the early years that some appear to envy the average package for a new investigator was probably times than today requiring quick success at the r game continuation of a research career perhaps one of the reducing the competitiveness of early investigators is level of support they become accustomed to prior to having compete on their own hot debate what do you think thumb up thumb down martin katz march at i fail to understand the goal of giving funding preference to a consequence of this is denying funding established investigators no matter how good or important research is in order to fund new investigators no matter inferior their research is the role of nih should be to fund research that is most likely to result in improved developing young investigators capable of directing such should be left to the universities if nih deems it desirable contribute to the development of new investigators this would better accomplished by establishing an program than by simply funding proposals based on the age experience of i agree with the earlier comment that if preference is given to applicants in the long term this will be counterproductive developing a new generation of scientists younger will see their older colleagues locked out of funding after of investment and will conclude that if they stay in the they will eventually encounter to same fate i have seen graduate students and postdocs decide to leave the field they see the struggles their mentors have in maintaining funding ie having the rug pulled out from under them building up a research like or dislike thumb up thumb down moonbeam march at i think you are alluding to what is really the root cause the lack of young investigators the best and the and too good and too bright to suffer a career in those that do enter the lair given proper because the senior folks are too busy projects to give them a shiny luster the nih programs neither fair nor foulthey are the shifting of chairs on like or dislike thumb up thumb down nms march at nih presides over the distribution of public funds in research that should benef the public therefore independently the age and the status of an applicant the nih should fund the innovative research the one that creates new values in opinion however nih has a poorly utilized channel of that may greatly help in supporting the next generation scientists this channel is the cumulative administrative received by an institution from nih i think that must use a significant fraction of this huge asset to support scientists in a verifiable and transparent manner by supportive conditions for their scientific development rather spending for additional compensation of bureaucracy establishment these articles of expenditure be linked entirely to the intellectual which of course depends on the intellectual activities of faculty and young to ensure that it works the control mechanism over this expenditure by an organization probably include a feedback from the junior faculty not only statistics of successful new grants like or dislike thumb up thumb down young investigator march at to you established investigators you had it much easier and that you are established you do not want to let go of your status and the privileges it affords you you are selfish and increasingly senile you are convinced you are the only with good ideas but the reality is you are spending so much chasing funding to maintain your little empires that it has been long time since you actually did any real scientific work you the why not retire when it is your time why not become emeritus spend your time mentoring young faculty how much is enough you why do you have to run empires until you the structure of nih is an inherent conflict between policy and the established reviewers if it were left to them established reviewers would get all the funding policy makers trying to control this to ensure that science has a future the biological age of the most spoiled most rotten most generation there is on the planet the examine some of the ways by which the experienced fight policies and undermine the efforts for innovation the ones are usually the ones on the study sections a investigator has a bunch of new ideas and a desire to pursue but has little to no preliminary data the established ones hmm interesting idea but here is how it can fail so get to us with more preliminary data by the time you resubmit may or may not have that much more to show then they shoot down and it is over even when policy makers tell them concentrate on the quality of the researcher and the impact of the idea and approach the expis ignore official policy and nail the new idea on the approach of the approach will be weaker the research is not done meanwhile what is it that these experienced pis do to they routinely misappropriate funds from one grant to preliminary data for another when they are continuously they spend half of an old one to get a new one half done which the way is illegal then they put in the new proposal with lots preliminary data no wonder the approach is excellent the work already almost done the expis even recognize this freely closed doors it is the big joke of nih and current academia is this so all of you fair competition posters are you dishonest or just horribly misinformed if you are expis then know how you play the it is in the best interest of the taxpayer to get good ideas out in high reward settings this incrementalism and poor quality of science and stupendous number pointless papers are all consequence of the greed and ego established pis who have managed to pervert the system in such way that it is now both grossly inefficient and if you want to do research there is no reason to have more maybe two because that is all that one can manage remaining actively participating in the research the taxpayer no benefit in funding empires of paperpushers who are maintained diligent and exploited postdocs our system is becoming more more like europe where it is all about ego and politics of science while they do have less funding as a whole produce disproportionately less science exactly because of perversity of the hierarchic system they have produced that where we are headed as like or dislike thumb up thumb down mateo luiz april

control drilling operations instead of a person on a joystick he concept of drilling automation has been around decades but only now is it coming to full fruition he motivated by the need to increase drilling efficiency and safety on rigs shell is one of several operators testing automated drilling many of the rigs feature automated systems and highly equipment they do not necessarily have sophisticated automated systems automation is a step beyond mechanization mr explained for example mechanized equipment is now available to with tripping functions but an individual is still controlling machine with mechanization we can handle a variety of tasks automation we have the control system do the same thing over and but whether the system is mechanized or automated the industry taking steps in the right in prototype is an autonomous drilling and trajectory control linked to the well plan it monitors drilling parameters appropriate controls that need to be communicated back to the rig navigates the course of the wellbore it was designed for drilling in unconventional plays where development involves of the same kind of wells mr anderson alignright httpaddr httpaddr allows computer to perform simple repetitive tasks while the driller monitor the operation and do activities such as maintenance crew competency safety or key to are wells where there is a tremendous amount of repetition which is a requirement for automation they are ideal for shale and methane fields tight oil and gas and heavy oils which require high well density in that regard the eagle ford was founds to be suitable test ground because of the high number of wells scadadrill the driller activates the system is always in control mr anderson said once turned on the starts the pumps and the rotation then goes back to the bottom drills a stand in rotary when the bottom of the joint is reached circulates the appropriate amount of fluid and presents the tool at the correct height for the driller to disengage the system to the crew to set the slips and make the system being enhanced so it can eventually conduct directional drilling in reliable and consistent way in this mode the system will start drill and when it needs to correct the actual well path to planned well path it will automatically orient tool face and slide the drill the required distance in the tool face he explained when the directional run is completed system will automatically revert to rotary drilling the generic is backward installable on any modern ac rig controlled by programmable logic controller plc but is not easily compatible mechanical scadadrill prototype been received with both keen interest and skepticism in the its important to understand that were not replacing humans automatic drillers mr

they tend to be quite slow he opportunities the industry has for example in resources the industry will have to make significant changes in way innovations are adopted we can take to years in technology maturation thats just not going to be acceptable if going to meet the energy challenge of the next century mr sharpe while plays a key role it in isolation wont deliver the of change that were going to need we need not only faster efforts but faster development deployment and replication of in the areas of automation and systems mr sharpe sees a significant opportunity for more innovation such as collaboration between academia contractors operators he cited one open innovation project under way at related to the automation of bop control systems where the goal is eliminate the possibility of human today our industry is done on a proprietary basis i think theres a there for a more open innovation in many other thats really provided a much faster pace of progress than weve had sharpe believes that no business can rely on its own proprietary efforts to solve its problems and must work more together collaboratively thats the challenge im out there is how can we innovate innovation challenge is to look at how technologies can work with one another in more integrated fashion technology tends to add value as part of integrated system but it rarely operates in isolation again back at the process how do we get more system thinking the equation mr sharpe and replication must be part of the early thinking in the innovation process you get this very slow pace of technology development that weve historically in our industry he said this will require employees the front line to be much more involved earlier in the maturation shells joint venture manufacturing project with national mr sharpe noted that in order to develop the natural gas supplies in a sustainable fashion were going to have to much better than we are today automation will be needed that can produce wells that can control the downhole process and that improve operational performance no matter how skilled humans theyre always going to make mistakes he said using machines to eliminate vibration minimize doglegs maximize mechanical energy to drill faster using fewer bits and rigs with environmental impact that will all be part of the next industry must make mr sharpe also will the transfer of knowledge and information from one project to the this is about how quickly we can replicate technology he said shells pinedale operations in north america for example it took decade to reduce the number of days per well from to groundbirch it took only three years to achieve the same curve in sichuan china we actually achieved that same learning in one year mr sharpe said

the relatively new class of services robotic solutions downhole mechanical hydraulic and electric technologies to problems and restore production in automated wellbore explained vice president welltec is presenting a session downhole robotic technologies for the oil and gas industry at construction automation workshop on july in vail tools are designed to remediation in wells that are scaled up or filled with sand from formation or for mechanical problems with the casing or jewelry as valves or gauges that are permanently in the well over the life the well these devices become disabled and wont work anymore said schwanitz who is also chairman of the intervention and coiled association for example if a downhole valve in an intelligent stops opening or closing on command from the surface a robotic can go in latch into a shifting sleeve and perform a sequence mechanically opens or closes that valve or even puts it into correct partially opened choked is sophisticated but complex and with complexity comes a higher of failure he continued as these wells become more complicated needs to be more intelligence applied in the way problems remediated this is where new automation such as robotics is intelligent interventions with remote monitor and control to catch with what the industry is putting in the alignright httpaddr httpaddr in automated wellbores can removed with a robotic milling offers lighter touch methods adjust the flow by cleaning or cycling disabled valves and the well most recently diagnostic sensors have been deployed with robotics to determine production or injection problems and expanded to include fiber optics and sensing technology provides a faster more alternative restore production especially in horizontal wells or offshore wells the two most challenging well intervention categories he conventional remediation methods such as coiled or threaded tubing drill pipe intervene in a blind mode and are expensive because they involve bringing in large amounts equipment and people which increases relatively tools are run into the hole on an electric wireline and can controlled from the surface as far as four to five miles away they are programmed in advance to do certain tasks in long wells the tools are run in on a tractor to clean out debris scale deposits and bring debris back to surface without fluids from the surface or using pumping equipment or a rig for wells robotics tools can clean leaking safety valves or remove replace a problem valve from a small intervention boat mobilizing a large semisubmersible rig at a cost of millions welltec introduced downhole robotics to market years ago the technology has finally achieved industry acceptance and is now used in every operating province schwanitz said operators and service companies are now realizing if they are going to design an intelligent completion in a well need to design it for intelligent interventions as cases completions are being designed with failure

awards are the largest and the competition is fierce proposals i often find myself working on involve healthcare which means coordinating between multiple entities such community clinics fqhcs hospitals and community based a substantial funding pie was divided into slices month as the cms innovation center created as part of the care act announced the awardees for the billion challenge competition the program was well received by the healthcare community involved with medicare and especially services approximately proposals were received in a very day window between november and january during the holidays of the year a challenge the ambitious timetable processing and evaluating the avalanche of proposals in march predictably extended another days seventeen california comprised the largest number of awardees among the states rico and one site not geographically defined massachusetts and york were next with awards an essential step in the grantsmanship process is to analyze how were funded especially when your proposal is not funded we know odds of winning for the entire pool were however with all awards coming to our home state we wonder what the odds were california the cms team provided comments by the evaluation group reviewed our proposal which were helpful we learned our financial was just fine the financial plan had presented the challenge to our team as specific formats were required that novel albeit logical calculations ie cost per beneficiary i have prepared the following analysis of awards made in using my own metrics for what i consider important congratulations the budget the foa suggested budgets no smaller than and not than in total over three years our proposal requested support compared to the ca awards our budget was th largest average budget was the median was eight of the awardees were budgeted above savings vs expenses the challenge in the innovation challenge was propose a project that would increase medicaid enrollments increasing medicaid spending the net effect would be to the million new medicaid enrollees in without breaking bank note that this post precedes the pending supreme court regarding the affordable care act editorial moment it is opinion that the ruling will not alter the course towards universal coverage of all citizens therefore projects proposed under this innovation challenge are here to the review committees compared the expected savings to the stated the requested it seems clear the review committees wanted see plenty of savings for each dollar spent the savings to ratio for our proposal was which was th smallest the savings ratio was or approximately in savings for dollar requested in support this incredible figure was proposed by proposal that will create new hires and train workers the ca proposal most similar to our own in terms of which was funded had the nd highest savings ratio at average was and the median was six awardees proposed return or greater for every spent five of those six budgeted more than new hires the first item under the foa section titled key for the proposal to be prepared was workforce deployment deployment we rated jobs creation a high priority we proposed create new hires which placed our proposal th among ca the largest number of new hires was the average number of hires was the median for new hires was cost per hire we thought this figure would be important to reviewers our cost per hire was which was in the middle the pack the median was trainees we considered trainees to be secondary to new hires proposal to train currently hired community health workers was to the bottom ranking th the proposal with the largest number projected trainees was an impressive also by a consortium that included california the average was the was a statewide multiple partner group including seiu and la will train workers without creating any new the innovation challenge is a good initiative it addresses challenges that threaten to collapse our system we expect similar initiatives will be forthcoming no matter election outcomes our healthcare system is that severely one of the benefits in preparing a proposal like this is the likelihood that project features will be recycled in projects our consortium of community clinics and three proposed to train a new cohort of community health workers to work current and enrollees among the principle was to reduce visits to emergency departments for illnesses a change that must take place a unique feature in proposal was that we actually created a curriculum that could offered through a california state campus to certify the new reduction of costly and needless ed visits is not going away soon training people from the community in standard ways to patients

march the senate committee on business professions economic development conducted a hearing under its sunset function during which the california acupuncture board cab chair executive director were advised in the opinion of the committee cab was too caught up in professional issues the cab was to respond to the background paper click acupuncture board background paper trunc which is worthwhile read for those interested in california acupuncture or the legislative oversight process the very brief minute ended with the committee letting the cab chair and executive know the committee was concerned about how the board what are the substantive issues that led the committee to send warning shot across the cab the cab does not function well because it does not use the it has to function independently and responsibly the committee ten issues in the background paper in the march hearing the and executive director offered little explanation the cab now respond to the background paper in if there is one particular criticism that becomes clear upon a few cab meetings it is that the cab fails to uphold its despite the mission being fairly the mission of the acupuncture board is to benefit educate protect the public through regulation of licensure development education standards provision of consumer information enforcement of the acupuncture licensure one of the most important cab functions is to approve training programs so that their graduates are permitted to sit for california acupuncture licensing exam cale the cab has approximately schools including located in california the rarely removes a training program from its approved list which growing despite very strong evidence that many of the approved are doing a terrible job preparing graduates to pass the cale are at least seven schools with less than half their graduates able pass the cale four of these programs have pass rates below might conclude the cab is more interested in approving schools realizing the cab vision which includes ensuring excellence practitioner training and why cale pass rates matter the rate at which graduates of a program pass the licensing exam is the first and foremost indicator the quality of their training most healthcare professions physical therapy nursing physician assistant and physician have rates above even licensed vocational nurses pass at a rate than the average pass rate for acupuncturists on the cale across decade and was ed these data are from the a pass rate this low means passing the licensing exam almost the same as flipping a there are only a few explanations for a pass rate this low the exam too hard the exam is poorly constructed eg it is does not what people study or the people taking the exam are simply not prepared the cab has had testimony from the own department that there is noting wrong with the cale as a tool the test is not irrelevant although some might argue cale not test enough conventional medicine the test is not too certain groups historically perform much better than other groups pointed out in the background paper pg that leaves conclusion many graduates as in on average are prepared that leads to only one other conclusion some schools do actually exist to train different conclusions would merit consideration if the evidence academic failure among so many training programs was short term it not here is the real question with so much strong evidence in hands why has the cab failed to take any action to protect the by doing a better job at ensuring the quality of training by at least the worst performing schools from its the cab approves schools that have testified to the cab they are not the business of training acupuncturists in one school testified that he expected his graduates would work as despite being visibly alarmed the chair voted with the other members to approve the school provisionally for three years while school clearly should not have been approved the idea of provisional approval is a good one that should form the basis of a the senate committee on business professions and economic appears to be ready to replace the cale with the national exam nccaom and remove the school oversight function deferring to the national certification body these are bad ideas because they simply kick the problem outside the state and nccaom serve the very schools that are problems in our state the cab wants to avoid the removal of their licensing and functions then the cab has to begin functioning according to mission and initiate a program that uses cale data to guide its approval in responding to the background paper the cab should recommend following new policy for evaluating currently approved schools and schools that are applying for all new schools seeking approval must meet new criteria to drafted by a qualified health professions educator experienced mainstream new schools can only receive approval for no more than three years the school must achieve a pass rate by year two and maintain it in year all currently approved schools must achieve a pass rate training programs that do not hit these marks should be removed the there is one more issue the number of graduates from any school actually sit for the cale the cab should require that each school its approved list must annually report the total number of and the number of graduates that took the cale each year the of graduates who take the exam should be any school with fewer than of its graduates who register and take the cale should be placed on one year probation to the standard if that standard is not met then that school should removed from the list of cab approved schools the school reapply after five years and significant the cab does not function well because it does not use its information available on its own website to function and responsibly the background paper covers other issues board approval of continuing education courses clearly not aligned acupuncture and scope of practice questions in previous sunset years eg and the cab has repeated explanations if the cab repeats this strategy once again it result in a significant loss of authority which would not

http://www.duke.edu/web/kenanethics/WayneNorman_RecognizingBusinessEthics.doc business and ethical challenges in awarding prizes for good corporate norman phd duke roux msc mcgill ma de seems to be a proliferation of prizes and rankings for ethical business over the past decade our principal aims in this article are to initiate an academic discussion of the epistemic and normative stakes in competitions and to help organizers of such competitions to think through some of these issues and the design options for dealing with them we have been able to find no substantive literature academic or otherwise that addresses either of these two broad topics and audiences our modest aim therefore is to suggest an agenda of issues and to begin to explore and analyze some of the possible arguments for and against various philosophical or practical solutions part i explores the challenges facing a committee including problems derived from what rawls calls the of in democratic societies reasonable people will always disagree over some basic values including those relevant to evaluating business practices and epistemic issues about how we can justify qualitative judgments on the basis of incomplete quantitative data we also try to identify risks and opportunity costs for granters in part ii we spell out a a range of design options and b some advice about how any particular committee might select among these options to best achieve its goals which typically involve highlighting and publicizing best practices for ethical and academics who specialize in business ethics know the drill they open the newspaper to see details of an emerging corporate scandal typically involving illegal activities and within a day or so the telephone rings and a journalist is on the line seeking an expert opinion on the of the firm at the heart of the scandal if there are two or three such scandals in quick succession the journalist may want an opinion on whether or why we are witnessing a general decline in business ethics more often than not the expert has very little to add to such stories the company or one of its managers broke the law the law had been put in place precisely to serve as a disincentive to engage in activities with particular types of ethically negative consequences the company or its agents knowingly or negligently went ahead with the dubious activities there is often little of interest that an ethicist can contribute here although journalists are obviously happy to be able to transmit some expert as bob dylan famously put it need a weatherman to know which way the wind you need an ethicist to tell you that fraud or theft or lying or poisoning people is unethical would be much more interesting for business ethicists to receive a different kind of call from journalists from time to time for example about a difficult dilemma faced by a business where it is not at all obvious what the most ethical solution is or to get to the point of this article many business ethicists would be delighted to comment on the innovative ethically practices of certain firms but these calls rarely come the net effect is that news is almost always bad news and one consequence of this is that it reinforces a perception of business and business leaders as fundamentally unethical checked only by the countervailing power of state regulations auditors police investigative journalists whistleblowers and heroic ngos goes without saying that many within the business community strongly dispute the reality of this perception and this is surely the major source of motivation behind many initiatives to develop prizes and awards for business ethics corporate citizenship corporate social responsibility and the like magazine features that attempt to rank the most ethical businesses or credible prizes for ethical businesses that are awarded in public ceremonies generate good news about business ethics moreover they may do so in ways that suggest that ethical practices are much more widespread than a typical citizen is usually led to believe it does seem that at least in north america there are now a growing number of such prizes and rankings although local chapters of the chamber of commerce and the better business bureau in the usa and canada have long given out prizes in recognition of ethical businesses and business people there are a number of new prizes and rankings over the last five or ten years including the initiation of rankings for ethical business or corporate citizenship by business ethics magazine now called cro magazine in the us the globe and report on business magazine and corporate knights magazine in canada as well as the observer newspaper in the the assumption that many organizations and publications may be currently contemplating initiating new prizes or rankings for ethical business we believe it is worth exploring some of the options and challenges for conducting a legitimate comparative evaluation of this sort to date there appears to be no existing literature academic or practical to guide the deliberations of a team trying to design a prize competition these competitions can involve potentially significant costs to both the organizers and the candidate firms as well as certain risks there are also a number of difficult philosophical challenges to address whenever one attempts to quantify or rank the kinds of qualitative achievements that constitute a ethical in part i of this paper we will survey the objectives benefits costs risks and other issues that make up the for a prize in business ethics and in part ii we will discuss a number of the design options for a legitimate prize competition of the rest of this article will be written to address directly the concerns of a committee exploring the possibility of setting up a prize or a ranking for ethical businesses most of the issues with rankings eg listing the top and prizes are similar and so for the sake of brevity we shall often talk only of prizes except in cases where the issues facing prizes and rankings are different this is not intended simply as a guide however we believe that the question of how to evaluate rank recognize and celebrate corporate social performance is a legitimate and neglected domain of research in the course of presenting issues and options for practical purposes we also hope to highlight more philosophical issues worthy of future research i thinking through the designing anything it helps to be clear about what it is for we shall assume that most organizations or publications setting out to design a prize or ranking for ethical business will have one or more of the following objectives in recognize and celebrate the good deeds or innovative practices of particular businesses or individual business publicize in hopes that they will spread provide a mild incentive for businesses to adopt policies and practices that may qualify them for recognition as an ethical firm or improve their ranking in the case of annual counter misconceptions about the business community in general based on the reporting bias that tends to highlight unethical other lists of options to follow we do not presume that this list is there may be other reasons for awarding an ethics prize to give an extreme example there are various prizes and lists currently available that publicize unethical businesses and part of their objective no doubt is to inspire protests against these firms and perhaps against private business or capitalism more it is not our aim to evaluate this particular list of objectives as such assuming they are pursued in good faith these are fairly uncontroversial and worthy objectives our reason for highlighting such a list at the outset is that depending on the weight given to each such objective or others some ways of designing and conducting the prize competition may do a better or worse job at achieving its aims it is also important given the costs and risks we will discuss presently for a committee contemplating the creation of a prize to think about whether there are other more effective or efficient ways of achieving these goals for example a magazine might decide that it can promote ethical business practices more efficiently simply by identifying a few admirable companies and publishing features on their innovations and are assuming that a committee contemplating the awarding of an ethics prize will itself take this responsibility ethically that is that it will aim to identify and award the most worthy candidates and that it will base its evaluations on adequate information and expertise this already raises the question of costs since much of the relevant information may not be readily available in general a organization could contemplate incurring or invoking costs such as the of publicizing the upcoming competition such as advertising and media relations building and maintaining a web site distributing nomination forms or information possibly identifying and contacting candidate firms to nominators to provide detailed information about their operations this process can be so costly that many organizations limit the number of rankings or prizes they will submit themselves for each to the organizers to verify at least some of this information and to conduct additional background searches of candidate firms or finalists eg to uncover pending law suits or existing legal or regulatory to organizers to process and evaluate applications handle queries secure meeting space arrange for and possibly pay for experts jury members and to publicize winners organize ceremonies prize or ranking that is taken seriously by the competing organizations and that makes objective criteria public runs the risk of creating perverse incentives for potential candidates to make investments in areas that will increase their chances of winning even in cases where these might not the best ways to achieve the results that are really being prized so to in addition to these more or less direct costs to prize organizers candidates and others who volunteer their time there are numerous risks that these parties assume some of which could eventually bear significant or perceived flaws or bias in the nomination or evaluation process could damage the reputation of the awarding organization and also lead to some embarrassment to winning firms whose prizes will seem questioning of the worthiness of winners especially from dubious conduct occurring or being revealed after the fact could discredit the this kind of controversy could also fuel the very sort of cynicism about business that a prize competition is trying to firms may be reluctant even to allow themselves to be nominated fearing the label ethical could make them a target for muckraking journalists or these obvious costs and risks including opportunity costs it is by no means obvious that a prize competition in business ethics will achieve the desired objectives or at least that it will achieve them better than some less costly or risky alternative such a competition could end up being a relatively expensive way of obtaining a small amount of publicity for ethical business practices and at worst it could backfire in ways that punish genuinely ethical business initiatives and tarnish further the reputation of private enterprise more generally or to put it more positively the challenge for organizers of such a competition is to design a process that will minimize some of the worst risks although such a process may well involve greater costs and to maximize the publicity and educational effects will return to options for the design and methodology of an ethics prize competition in part ii below first though we will finish this section on the challenges facing organizers of an ethics prize by looking at some of the more philosophical and ethical issues at and ethical are two different kinds of ethical challenges that a committee organizing an ethics prize will face first there are issues concerning the ethics if you will of its own operations and processes and secondly there are theoretical and philosophical issues about what ultimately are the most justifiable ways of evaluating and comparing the ethical performance of different firms here are some examples of these two very different sorts of ethical issues in reverse order issues in ethical theory and issues in ethical are several overlapping ways we might sum up the general challenge for ranking the ethical practices of different firms some of which invoke some of the deepest most intractable issues in ethical are a plurality of basic values and principles and reasonable people can disagree about which ones are more important or fundamental in any given situation john rawls famously refers to this as fact of something that must be taken into account by any adequate theory of justice or social responsibility in a democratic fact of pluralism is illustrated in the way critics of and apologists for modern business emphasize different objectives for ethical or socially responsible business at the extreme some critics will evaluate businesses largely in terms of their impact on the environment while many business leaders will emphasize minimizing fraud by employees and fulfilling fiduciary duties to these two observations a organization seeking broad legitimacy and acceptance of its judgments will have to try to reconcile what are perhaps irreconcilable normative perspectives when it evaluates candidate can also observe that it is fundamentally unclear how we can quantify levels of ethical or unethical conduct if a person keeps the next three promises but tells one lie has her increased or decreased if a firms donates dollars to a worthy charity but is caught dumping toxic waste is this a net positive or net negative ethical performance if these questions sound absurd or impossible to answer objectively it may be because of this basic difficulty quantifying qualitative ethical evaluations see norman and macdonald and if we have difficulty quantifying one ethical performance it will be that much harder to compare the ethics of multiple might also note the epistemic difficulty for any committee external to a firm or even for to gather all the information that is necessary for an informed evaluation for some vanguard firms that have over the past decade or so been submitting themselves to internal and external social auditing or bottom accounting this process can take a full year and involve significant corporate resources including employees engaged in stakeholder relations and obviously no organization can conduct such an audit of all candidate could easily extend this list of basic issues in the justification of ethical judgments that are alive and directly relevant to the comparative evaluation of businesses but these points already lay out some daunting challenges that earnest must somehow attempt to negotiate in addition as noted like any organization they will have to be scrupulous about their own ethics and perceptions thereof consider just two of the more likely ethical are general questions about fairness including questions of whether the conceptions and criteria for ethical business incorporate a broad range of perspectives for example the perspectives of different types of stakeholders such as investors bankers consumers employees or union members perceptions of fairness in the competition will also be influenced by the selection of particular judges and whether they reflect a range of differing perspectives about ethical there could be general and specific questions of bias on the part of committee organizers or judges including potential conflicts of interests if firms close to these individuals are also candidates for the prize these potential concerns presumably require clear and transparent procedures for dealing with conflicts of of these truncated lists of issues give us an indication of the urgency of the design challenge for anyone wishing to create a prize or an annual ranking for ethical businesses a badly designed prize competition could do more harm than good we will now turn to some of the specific options for designing competitions and evaluation methodologies ii thinking through the survey of design options for a business ethics ranking or prize competition is based in part on an examination of the criteria and methodologies used by a number of existing competitions again see the appendix for a partial list of existing in other words most of the options we will discuss have actually been used by existing prize competitions or rankings although we have also supplemented the of design options with certain innovations we have not yet found in practice we make no claim to having surveyed every competition many of these are local or regional with a particular city state or province and most do not provide detailed information on their rules processes or methods our aim in this article is to initiate an academic discussion of prize competitions with a fairly comprehensive set of parameters we welcome future research on the merits of various design options as well as on some of the deeper philosophical issues of the sort raised in part rest of part ii will discuss some of the advantages and disadvantages of options under the following prize in criteria for eligibility or to collect verify and evaluate to publicize prize in have so far discussed vaguely the idea of a prize for or business ethics we all have some idea what it means to be an ethical business especially in contrast to businesses that seem plainly unethical for example businesses that break or bend rules and laws in the pursuit of profit or personal enrichment paying no heed to the consequences of their activities for other stakeholders especially when these gains are derived almost entirely from exploiting market still it is not at all clear what terminology or normative category should be used to describe the kind of prize or competition more precisely it is not at all obvious that the organizers should want to give out a prize in or for the ethical there are at least two reasons why they may hesitate to use this terminology first the term has for many people a more limited connotation relating primarily to the virtues of individuals and their actions eg about whether an individual is honest courageous treats others with respect steal etc they necessarily think of as a category that takes into account all of the positive social and environmental contributions a firm may be responsible for and second many potential recipients may be somewhat embarrassed and even apprehensive about being awarded a prize for being most firm or business person it sounds pretentious and perhaps a little and as we noted already it may draw the attention of muckraking critics eager to expose any example of conduct in the ethical both of these reasons for eschewing the language of per se it is not surprising that many of the prizes and rankings have in fact adopted other terminology even business ethics magazine in its annual ranking of firms claimed to rank them in terms of their as does corporate knights magazine and new prix de citoyenne in quebec similarly the ethics in action organization an ngo in british columbia canada that is financed by some corporations gives out annual prizes not for ethics but for and the us chamber of commerce also chooses to give awards with specific prizes for and opting for the language of business ethics are not unheard of eg the better business bureau gives out awards in both the us and internationally for but they seem to be in the minority in any case we simply want to underline here that the choice of terminology is an important consideration in the overall design of a competition of this sort and one that is not merely a question of semantics or political correctness it is a way to manage some of the risks mentioned in part i as well as to reduce some of the potential philosophical controversies associated with broad and controversial ethical categories for the sake of brevity we will continue using the language of here though it should be understood that this covers the broad range of normative categories discussed in this subsection among choice about what exactly to award the prize for concerns the choice between recognizing the overall performance of a business on the one hand and one or more of a practices acts or policies on the other this choice has implications for many of the other decisions about the process and the methodology and it can also be considered a crucial juncture in the attempt to manage some of the costs risks as well as some of the philosophical challenges raised in part i put quite simply it is easier in many ways to evaluate and compare some individual practices of different firms that it is to evaluate the ethical performance of a firm and to compare this to other firms evaluating single practices eliminates many but not all of the philosophical concerns about global evaluations of a firm eg balancing charitable donations and dumping and it also reduces the costs and risks for firms that are participating in the competition they are being recognized for particular innovations so they do not have to submit information on a wide range of their activities and they will not have to carry around the burden of being considered the company similarly the organizers of the prize reduce some of their own risks that would come with awarding a prize for ethical to a company that is later shown to have unethical skeletons in its closet a company could be recognized for certain ethical practices even if it was less than perfect in other domains prizes for specific innovative practices might also help achieve some of the ultimate objectives of the competition better for example it may provide the press with more or achievements to describe and in publicizing the innovations of both nominees and winners some very valuable information about best practices can be widely disseminated and adopted by other firms there can be something a little about simply listing a number of firms that are admired but perhaps for nothing in particular given all of these potential advantages to recognizing specific practices rather than performance it is interesting that so few of the existing we have studied has opted for this criteria for eligibility or even the smallest jurisdictions in which an ethics prize might be awarded there will be literally thousands of firms consider the yellow pages or the section listing businesses in even a telephone book it would be practically impossible to put it mildly for any organization to conduct an ethical evaluation of all of these firms it will need to develop some criteria for eligibility and nomination research of existing competitions has not uncovered criteria for eligibility that explicitly exclude firms apart from standard geographical or size requirements in principle organizers could decide to exclude any firm that has been convicted for violating laws or regulations in say the previous five years or like some firms offering they could in principle exclude firms in certain sectors such as tobacco gambling firearms etc but such screening may not be considered urgent as an qualification since any such information could also be weighed in the evaluation process more typical way to entrants is simply to provide for different awards or rankings for businesses of different sizes small medium large as measured by revenues or employees or different sectors there are numerous obvious reasons for giving out multiple prizes in smaller categories like this we might point out that so doing also helps resolve at least some of the philosophical challenges we raised in part i concerning intractable disputes derived from the plurality of values in democratic society imagine an ethics competition in which a jury was asked to consider two finalists one being a large international petrochemical firm that has undertaken a mission and the other being a small organic food store it is hard to imagine that they would really be using the same ethical categories or criteria for evaluating these two kinds of firms even the metaphor seems inadequate to describe the difference between the normative challenges faced by the managers of these two kinds of firms by allowing them to compete in different categories by size or sector it is more likely that they will be compared more objectively to firms of a similar type and dealing with similar challenges possibility for reducing the potential divergence of ethical categories of relevance to different achievements is to give out different awards for practices and innovations pertaining to different stakeholder groups in this way for example an organization could give out different awards for firms that excelled in the treatment respectively of their employees customers suppliers shareholders local communities or the environment more generally now as we have just seen some of the awards that we have surveyed do focus on more specific stakeholder relations like this and moreover there are numerous prizes and rankings that do not even present themselves as that focus directly on employee relations industrial relations governance environmental management customer satisfaction etc again for our purposes here we simply want to underline that comparative evaluations within relatively specific categories can a reduce the divergence of normative criteria b enable the specification of more and transparent criteria and thereby c lower the likelihood that the judging process will be seen as arbitrary or is also a question of how firms will be nominated to be considered for the prize there are three general possibilities all of which we see among the existing firms of a specific type could be automatically considered whether they want to be or for example it could be the largest n firms from a particular stock exchange or the n largest firms within a specified geographical or political region such as the admired category among the fortune this option is typically used by magazines that rank could solicit nominations at large firms could nominate themselves or be nominated by others or both this will generally lower the total number of candidates especially if the nomination process is somewhat onerous eg with multiple nominating letters or the agreement of the nominated themselves could undertake to nominate or solicit the participation of firms or similarly they could create a fairly large panel of experts or interested parties or conduct an opinion poll of some kind in order to identify candidate combination of the latter two or even of all three methods is possible the choice of method used has implications for how organizers will cope with some of the challenges we raised in part i as well as with their choice of some of the other design options we are discussing here in part ii obviously an important issue concerns how many firms an organization could reasonably expect to evaluate given its resources a nomination process must be chosen in part as a way of limiting the number of candidates the question of whether participation is voluntary will also directly affect the quantity and quality of information that the judges will have at their disposal if firms nominate themselves or agree to be nominated they can reasonably be expected to provide detailed information of a sort that they are not normally required to divulge but if they are being ranked without their prior consent judges may have to stick to publicly available data which is generally quite limited especially for firms not listed on public stock exchanges voluntary participation would also permit firms to avoid the competition if they feared that the glory of being considered the most ethical might not outweigh the risk of being targeted by critics who would like to expose them as hypocrites and in the case of firms that might actually fear they have in their such a withdrawal might also save the awarding organization from the embarrassment of giving an award to a firm just before it is exposed for to collect verify and evaluate we noted in part i a large part of the cost of conducting a prize competition in business ethics for both the organizers and the nominated firms involves the collection and evaluation of data we have also seen the ways in which a thorough collection of relevant data can go a long way to reducing the risks that emerge when journalists or the public can plausibly doubt the objectivity of the process decisions about the collection and the evaluation of the data are intimately linked if final decisions are going to be made by a panel of judges certain kinds of data say from testimonials and interviews may be appropriate whereas if winners or rankings are going to be determined via the data alone with various normatively determined weighting methods and so on then data that are directly quantifiable will be much good data an organization can gather is a function largely of the total budget and of the number of candidates or finalists the quicker a shortlist can be developed perhaps on the basis of some general and comparable information the more resources can be devoted to gaining a clearer picture of the of a smaller number of finalists the existing prize competitions and rankings that we have studied we see a broad range of often creative techniques for gathering data on firms the most rigorous analyses use multiple and overlapping sources of information the first question that arises for a organization is the we undertake to gather the information we outsource the to a research firm we do we do some combination of and obvious reasons the choice among these three options and more particularly the choice to rely heavily on outsourced research will have an impact on some of the risks involved in the entire process roughly speaking the legitimacy of the process will depend to some degree on the perceived objectivity and integrity of the research regardless of the choice made among these three options both and researchers will have to gather information from the following sorts of primary from the firms themselves typically through testimonial letters or documents or from the firms themselves through publicly available reports such as annual reports of financial and some public sources information typically from various government departments such as records of criminal allegations fines law suits reports from regulatory agencies lobby registries public or proprietary sources of information typically from organizations private research and ratings firms firms press reviews some of these data will be as and reliable as official sources of information but some of it may be questionable or spotty given the limited resources of such research nomination letters and testimonials from individuals outside the contending opinion polls of the general public or perhaps of a selected large group eg business journalists ceos chief ethics and compliance officers the memories and opinions of members of a jury if there is one who are charged with making the final comparative judgments among finalists that is jury members may have certain views about some of the firms or even the types of firms in the competition and we cannot ignore the impact these views can have on the eventual goes without saying that virtually every prize or ranking competition in business ethics will use information drawn from more than one of these sources we shall not discuss here the strengths and weaknesses of each of these sources of information or how much each one would cost and how relying on them would augment or reduce risks it seems like a comprehensive assessment of this sort is worthy of at least one whole article on its own at the risk of belaboring the obvious however we would like to add a few observations about the challenges faced by an organizing committee trying to choose among these sources of information most general piece of advice here is best illustrated by the old parable of the drunk scanning the pavement beneath a street lamp a passerby asks him what looking for responds the drunk hopefully not his car keys did you drop asks the passerby over motions the drunk in the direction of a dark area beyond the light from the streetlamp looking here because this is where the light its attempt to discover which companies are most deserving of an award the committee will sometimes have to choose between objective information that is of only limited relevance to an ethical evaluation of a firm the equivalent of the information exposed by the streetlamp or somewhat less clear or less reliable information that is nevertheless more directly pertinent like the information gathered by feeling around the pavement in the dark on hands and knees in the general area where the keys as rawls used to note in his lectures at harvard when talking about the basic inputs for ethical judgment it is better to be vaguely right than precisely wrong of course there are numerous sources of information that are both reliably objective and directly pertinent although even then sometimes such information may be available for only some of the firms in the other things equal more information from more sources is better but more information sometimes adds to controversy rather than eliminating it more information from more sources often presents evaluators with inconsistencies and even contradictions not to mention for which there are no set algorithms consider the very public debates over the of where supporters and critics put forward impressive evidence for very different conclusions about say impact on employment or and even when there is agreement on some of these data there remain deep divisions over questions like how we evaluate the overall impact of the introduction of a new store in a region if say it increases the purchasing power for poor families by but also reduces the total number of jobs by our research we have found that rankings in magazines and elsewhere tend to err somewhat on the side of the so to speak they tend to use more publicly available quantifiable data that can be found for all of the firms in their survey eg the percentage of net income given to it is unfortunate if this requires leaving out potentially useful data that is not available for all firms or is not as reliable or quantifiable such reliance on under the street at least allows them to conduct similar ranking exercises in successive years which may show progress and regress for certain firms and its very may protect the organizers from accusations of bias one of the risks of relying on such a however is that sometimes firms that are widely perceived as unscrupulous or otherwise ethically dubious might actually find themselves ranking well on the basis of the objective data and this can cast doubt on the whole ranking exercise if not actually subject it to the other end of the spectrum many prizes use multiple sources of often incomplete and even inconsistent information and rely on juries of experts to balance it intuitively such a process is less likely to anoint controversial or winners but for obvious reasons is also always open to accusations of ideological or personal bias such accusation may best be countered by a combination of transparency about the judges and their presumably respectable and noteworthy backgrounds on the one hand and a commitment to a diverse jury with members drawn from different stakeholder groups types of organizations cultural communities and points on the ideological spectrum etc on the to publicize part i we began by noting the ultimate objectives that most committees will have when deciding to organize a prize in business ethics objectives like recognition for vanguard firms and promotion of their innovative best practices as well as some good press in general for a business community which may be more used to tales of scandals very few of these objectives can be met no matter how rigorous the processes already discussed in part ii if there is not adequate publicity of winners and their is not our place here to give advice on this kind of marketing and public relations exercise but for the sake of laying out a comprehensive set of design options we can report that three modes of publicizing and celebrating winners are common among existing prizes with all three being used in some media sources with a interviews a banquet or reception with finalists sponsoring organizations media etc in the hall often to unveil the winners among the with a newspaper or magazine to produce a feature on the finalists and winners in some cases magazines themselves undertake to organize their own contests typically in the form of addition to considering which of these methods of publicizing and celebrating will have the most impact organizers can take advantage of this final stage to further legitimize their processes through principal aims in this article are to initiate an academic discussion of the epistemic and normative stakes in competitions and to help organizers of such competitions to think through some of these issues and the design options for dealing with them it goes without saying that an initial survey of these numerous topics can barely scratch the surface on the practical side deeper discussion and debate must take place among organizing committees to meet some of the challenges we have underscored in ways that are consistent with their goals values and we must not forget budgets our most general conclusion for practitioners is that a there are significant costs and risks involved in awarding prizes and the opportunity costs may well be higher than other means of achieving similar goals but b these opportunity costs are not insurmountable and a prize competition does hold significant promise as a way to celebrate publicize and diffuse ethically innovative business practices and managerial there has been virtually no academic discussion of prizes and rankings in business ethics per se it must be said that there has been considerable debate over many of the most problematic underlying issues facing competition designers there are at least two types of core problem first a tremendous amount of information about each firm would be necessary to make an informed judgment about its level of ethics social responsibility or corporate citizenship again one has only to look at the amount of resources and time that individual firms spend in order to gather information for their own social and environmental audits no organization will ever have anything close to this amount of information on all the firms even on its shortlist so it will necessarily be making comparative evaluations on the basis of very incomplete information in addition and this is the second type of fundamental problem we want to highlight here even with a vast amount of potentially relevant information about a firm there does not exist any agreed upon method for aggregating these data to arrive at something like an bottom even the major agencies and firms promoting social and environmental auditing or accounting have not dared to propose an actual aggregative methodology that parallels the ones in financial some ratings firms of various sorts as well as some rankings in magazines have developed very specific ways of weighting a relatively small number of data on firms in order to come up with cardinal scores and ordinal rankings such scoring systems might for example give a firm points for each percentage of its net profits it donates to charity or for each women or member of a it has on its board and so but such weightings will always be controversial given the of underlined by rawls as we noted earlier debates about whether or not is for show how reasonable people can quite reasonably attach different levels of importance to different levels of attention to the interests of different stakeholder groups we would not argue at this point that mechanical weighting systems must absolutely be eschewed in evaluation methodologies of a prize competition but such methodologies do generally risk producing results that are exactly wrong so to speak rather than vaguely right this is clearly an issue worthy of more detailed academic short the challenges of gathering relevant information and of these numbers to arrive at robust uncontroversial bottom are formidable in business ethics and in ethical theory more general no organization is going to definitively solve these problems nor should it have to try to this suggests that a realistic committee will to some extent have to try to maintain its legitimacy while nevertheless giving up on any illusions of objectively and uncontroversially identifying winners rather when designing its methods and processes as well as in its communications to the public and to participating firms it should keep its eyes on its ultimate objectives for the exercise typically these objectives are recognitional but more importantly educational it is trying to educate the business community at large on the best practices of ethical management and the general public on the commitments of many within the business community to do good while doing well in the course of this article we have suggested a number of ways organizers can avoid pitfalls that stand in the way of achieving this goal r d nitkin k otto p

published online in the journal of business ethics on july at hyperlink httpaddr httpaddr springer the is available at httpaddr see the appendix for a list of a number of the prizes and rankings we have been tracking in addition we should note there are many firms that collect statistics to gauge social responsibility or ethical fitness some of which are contracted by the organizations for

exemplify good corporate citizenship by making corporate social responsibility a key aspect of their daily and b the better business bureau torch award is designed to promote not only the importance of ethical business practices but the willingness and efforts made by outstanding businesses to ensure that our marketplace remains fair and honorable for all consider another possible objective an organization or corporation may decide to create and award an ethics prize as a way of enhancing its own brand or reputation indeed this may almost always be part of the motivation for creating a prize and as such it is likely to figure into how the organization thinks about certain issues we shall raise for example there is the worst ranked by the multinational monitor latest issue or

creating a perverse incentive imagine a social ranking methodology that gives points for a firm providing day care for the children of employees but not for say paying employees to perform charity work per month now imagine say a small biotech firm with relatively wealthy employees who can afford daycare that might decide to cancel its policy of paying employees to do charity work once a month in order to fund a new employee daycare this might plausibly result in a less socially responsible firm but one that would then rank higher in the competition surely the reputation of cfo magazine took a hit for having awarded andrew fastow a excellence for capital structure management in less than two years before that capital structure management would lead to one of the greatest collapses and scandals in american corporate history to its credit cfo magazine has kept the embarrassing evidence on its website hyperlink httpaddr httpaddr as rawls puts it modern democratic society is characterized not simply by a pluralism of comprehensive religious philosophical and moral doctrines but by a pluralism of incompatible yet reasonable comprehensive doctrines no one of these doctrines is affirmed by citizens generally nor should one expect that in the foreseeable future one of will ever be affirmed by all or nearly all rawls xvi our italics the most eloquent description of this fundamental incompatibility of basic values that is the fact that we must always be willing to make sacrifice some values for others in our designs of political institutions and projects is still to be found in isaiah inaugural lecture from concepts of berlin esp see eg the survey of the opinions of ceos in the us southeast region by the rutland institute for ethics hyperlink httpaddr httpaddr

citoyenne in quebec which does this quite explicitly and the ethics in action awards in british columbia which emphasize subcategories favouring particular bold there is significant variation among the prizes we studied regarding the transparency of their methodologies understandably some organizations may feel that their system is proprietary additionally other organizations contract with firms that refuse to reveal their metrics it is important to note that there are two major problems that can be encountered with the use of questionnaires first there is a social desirability bias of the main problems for investigators that utilise methods which require direct responses from research subjects concerning morality is the possibility of encountering social desirability bias when asked the question your company or your company there are few executives that would tick the crane second there is also the factor caused by the large number of questionnaires that companies have to fill out for various reasons maitland for example corporate knights magazine which is one of the more transparent players in the ranking game includes the following sources of information in their citizen public filings federal lobby registry pollution watch national pollutant release inventory shareholder association for research and education human resources and skills development canada a federal agency standard tax justice network and the us environmental protection agency on the other hand the globe and report on business magazine and the business ethics now cro magazine mainly rely on private research firms for their data jantzi research and kld research analytics commerce magazine in quebec canada publishes an annual ranking of corporations based entirely on perceptions drawn from a for sources of measurable criteria of normative relevance a committee can consider the standards that are produced by numerous organizations that propose norms for social and environmental auditing eg the global reporting initiative sa and various iso consider for example two rival dvds the the high cost of low prices or the why works and why this makes people crazy or for a more balanced assessment of the debates see fishman the presence of a tobacco company rothmans among the best corporate citizens in corporate knights ranking stirred considerable controversy hyperlink httpaddr

food production will need to double during a period when climate change will fossil fuels will dwindle and water availability will in addition if we are to protect what biodiversity we can doubling of agricultural output must take place using the same of farmland without impacting upon remaining natural to tackle this problem scientists in oxford department plant sciences are aiming to develop crop strains which be better adapted to this landscape of the near boosting rice professor jane langdale head of the department of plant sciences engaged in the project an international effort funded by bill melinda gates foundation more million people in currently depend on rice for the bulk of their calorific intake and is predicted that during the next years rice production needs increase by per cent in order to feed the growing asian whilst adapting to adverse changes in climate and water photosynthesis converts carbon dioxide and the energy from into chemical energy and takes place in cell organelles chloroplasts the chemical energy produced in these chloroplasts then used by plants to live grow and in the case of crops conventional rice varieties use a standard photosynthesis pathway as but under certain conditions such as warmer this pathway is inefficient a number of plants including maize evolved an extra photosynthesis pathway called to solve problem the c photosynthesis pathway can increase efficiency by per cent and iintroducing it into rice could provide the answer impending food the c rice project is often quoted as being order to work large changes need to be made to both the anatomy rice leaves and the chemical reactions that take place inside however there is encouraging evidence that it could be work on the glk genes suggests that they may play a role regulating whether a chloroplasts use c or c ongoing work in her laboratory seeks to put glk genes from maize naturally c crop into rice plants her work on chloroplasts began to an interest in the genetic control of development in plants than a specific aim to put c photosynthesis into other plant whilst developing new c crops had always seemed like an idea she never thought it would be years of chloroplast research later jane was ready to move into research areas it was at this point in that the rice research institute irri invited jane to a c rice workshop originally reluctant to go she was persuaded to attend julian hibberd from the university of cambridge and found getting excited by the proposed project she is now months into a year proof of concept project involved in testing the feasibility c rice a necessary step called for by a paper incurrent opinions plant biology written with julian and john sheehy from irri last using less as well as facing climate change st century agriculture will have to cope with the decline in fossil fuels the work of sherardian professor of botany liam dolan aims to produce crops grow healthily without excessive fertiliser phosphate is required by all living organisms to build components and the low availability of phosphate in environments can severely limit plant growth the soil of all africa and one third of china is deficient in this nutrient the application of artificial fertilisers all over the has so far dealt with this problem and contributed to the increase productivity seen in the green revolution of the th phosphate is extracted from mines mainly in morocco the usa the former soviet union and south africa with per cent of phosphate produced being put into fertilisers the extraction transport of phosphate for agricultural use constitutes a annual cost and carries a large carbon footprint furthermore oil phosphate reserves are finite and some predictions claim phosphate mines could be exhausted within the next work aims to develop crops which are better adapted to their own phosphate from the soil making them less dependent artificial plants can naturally extract their own phosphate from the soil root hairs structures which grow along roots research group have discovered a family of genes which control hair growth and they are working to modulate the expression of genes in crop plants their aim is to increase the number of root a plant produces in response to naturally occurring phosphate in soil they have developed transgenic wheat and rice varieties of producing longer root hairs and are now moving on to experiments to test the yield of these plants in the absence commercial unlike jane chloroplast work this has always been the for liam he jokes that his team are now finally at the stage he hoped to be at by the end of his phd explaining that this has been very large project starting from scratch and requiring the of all the necessary genes planning for st in light of the global food security crisis we will soon be facing department of plant sciences will next year be launching st century cropsresearch initiative this initiative seeks to an oxford professorship in crop science and to encourage research so that discoveries made about plant metabolism growth development can be transferred to agriculturally valuable crop however both jane and liam believe that whilst plant science has a to offer in solving the food security challenge the role governments and funding bodies is crucial a point that was at the security in the st symposium hosted by graduate students last due to the unequal distribution of global wealth the countries the most immediate problems do not have the funds to overcome jane argues that to tackle food security there must be funding and input from wealthy countries in order to bring developing nation benefits liam points out that every day the number of people die from malnutrition as from cancer reflecting bias of interest in developed countries however whilst research alone cannot solve the issue of food security in the face global politics it is says jane a very exciting time to be a penny sarchet is based at oxford department of

this call with a total budget of eur project title evolution of development in abstract different morphologies evolve in different organisms response to changing environments as land plants developmental mechanisms were either generated de novo or recruited from existing toolkits and adapted to facilitate changes form some of these changes occurred once others on occasions and others were gained and then subsequently lost in subset of lineages why have certain forms survived and others not does a fern look different from a flowering plant and why developmental biologists care by determining how many different there are to generate a particular morphology we gain an of whether a particular transition is constrained this information allows an assessment of the extent to which variation can modify developmental mechanisms and an indication of degree of developmental plasticity that is possible both within and between species this proposal aims to characterize developmental mechanisms that underpin the diverse shoot forms seen extant plant species the main goal is to compare mechanisms that operate in vegetative shoots of bryophytes ferns and angiosperms with a view to understanding the that limit morphological variation specifically we will the developmental basis of three major innovations that altered morphology of vegetative shoots during land plant evolution formation of a embryo organization of apical centres and patterning of leaves in distinct spatial along the shoot to facilitate progress we also aim to transgenic methods create mutant populations and generate transcriptomes for species at key phylogenetic nodes proposed work will generate scenarios to explain how land plant evolved and perhaps more importantly how it could change in more mabberley

consumer health requires a understanding of the biochemical signalling pathways that pathogen differentiation and infection of the the free radical nitric oxide no is small and simple yet it some of the most intricate and significant signalling functions in animals it acts in neurotransmission and regulation of pressure and is induced during the inflammatory response in no affects development can

genome identified four nitric oxide nos genes with high sequence homology and similar domain structure animal noss quantitative traced the profiles of these genes over a of development of m from germination of the fungal spore and growth of the emerging tube to differentiation of the specialized infection cell appressorium and penetration of host leaves the transcript profile one gene nos was upregulated fold at the time of maturation and penetration compared with levels seen in ungerminated spore chemical inhibitors of nos enzymes inhibited formation of appressoria signifying a role for no in development however the small signalling molecule camp allowed appressoria formation in the presence of nos inhibitors camp acts downstream of no in a signalling pathway to permit investigation of the importance of no in m grisea development a knockout mutant was generated it forms very few appressoria consequently causes radically fewer disease lesions on leaves exogenous camp rescues the

develops foundations and tools for system integration and validates results in experiments using automotive and avionics experimental platforms the proposed new integration science a major departure from the current compartmentalized systems design building on a rigorous theory will develop the foundations and methods and tools for constructivity and predictability in cps integration the brings together a large interdisciplinary group of researchers design and software engineering vu umd in science and engineering nd umd in control theory and nd umd vu and in computer engineering and networking vu the overarching goal is to make integration of cps predictable and the research partner general motors center has been committed to join the team and to and electrical architecture challenge problems evaluation metrics and development it would be hard to find a technology other than systems of large cps that is more undervalued scientifically and at the time has bigger impact on the future of engineered systems the significance of this problem has been recognized long by industry considered to be a grand challenge the proposed research program three focus areas to change the status quo theory compositionality in heterogeneous systems tools and architectures for systemintegration and research theory of compositionality will extend and deepen mathematical foundations of system integration the primary approach to target simplification to develop and deploy theories and for decoupling that prevent or decrease the formation intractable interdependences and maintain on each layer for carefully selected essential system tools and tool architectures will focus on the foundations composing tool chains as components in tools will be achieved by exploring semantic foundation design key to this effort is research in and for composing transforming and models research is essential focusing the research team on problems validating experimentally and creating and transitioning results since experimental infrastructure for system integration is expensive for university projects the research team established a that involves a key industry stakeholder general motors global this project because of its focus on foundations will provide a paradigm based on modern systems science for integrating complex because of its attention to methodologies the research will new tools for incremental system integration and design methods ensure performance and safety beyond what can be achieved by ad hoc practices these outcomes of the project are prerequisites the cost effective development and deployment of many safety security critical cps ranging from medical devices to to defense and avionics the impact of this change on teaching research is profound and will comprise both undergraduate graduate levels at the participating institutions the team complement the conventional curriculum in systems with one that admits computation as a primary concept the changes will be aggressively promoted through a process of and textbook preparation to adapt the technical material to the of the participating institutions and will be disseminated widely project will engage undergraduate students from around the finally the attention to a new education model will create a generation of engineers who will be able to master the design complex heterogeneous systems that will be the backbone of the systems theodorakopoulos publish new book on path problems in path problems in professor john s baras and alumnus a senior researcher at the polytechnique de lausanne epfl have published a new titled path problems in the book is part of morgan synthesis lectures communication networks under the editorship of professor walrand of the university of california berkeley this is an series of to page publications on topics related to the implementation and management of communication networks each is a presentation of one topic by a leading expert topics range from algorithms to hardware implementations and cover broad spectrum of issues from security to the series addresses technologies from sensor networks reconfigurable optical the monograph provides a modern view on the algebraic path which is a generalization of the shortest path problem in various instances of this abstract problem have appeared in literature and similar solutions have been independently and rediscovered the repeated appearance of a problem is evidence its relevance this book aims to help current and future add this powerful tool to their arsenal so that they can identify and use it in their own path problems in networks can be conceptually divided into two parts distillation of the extensive theory behind the algebraic path and an exposition of a broad range of applications first the path problem is presented so as to fix terminology and existence and uniqueness of solutions robustness to parameter and centralized and distributed computation algorithms then concepts are generalized to the algebraic context of semirings for creating new semirings useful for modeling new problems provided a large part of the book is then devoted to applications of the algebraic path problem ranging from mobile routing to bgp routing to social networks these applications show kind of problems can be modeled as algebraic path problems they serve as examples on how to go about modeling new this monograph will be useful to network researchers engineers graduate students it can be used either as an introduction to topic or as a quick reference to the theoretical facts and application examples the theoretical background assumed for reader is that of a graduate or advanced undergraduate student computer science or engineering some familiarity with algebra algorithms is helpful but not necessary algebra in particular used as a convenient and concise language to describe problems that essentially the monograph is available for free electronically for

new national foundation nsf networking technology and systems nets for component based routing and clique based scheduling modular design of mobile networks the grant provide in funding over three years dr vahid tabatabaee the tabatabaee was by former faculty leandros tassiulas and dr baras and received his phd in engineering in tabatabaee is a former isr assistant scientist now with broadcom corporation in san jose systematic methodologies for the design of distributed implementable routing and scheduling algorithms that enable one design provision and manage mobile wireless networks with and controllable performance are lacking the research project a new framework for modular design of scheduling routing algorithms for networks efficient routing scheduling algorithm for networks are among the most network problems the proposed research some of the assumptions of wireless network methods are used for scheduling where cliques are in the interference graph a clique based scheduler first identifies group of critical cliques whose weights are close to the maximum schedule hence scheduling turns into finding an independent set nodes network links that cover the cliques clique based policies developed to achieve optimal throughput and as basis for implementable algorithms for scheduling clique based scheduling easier and more flexible because to schedule a clique we can any link of it and when a link is scheduled all cliques that belongs to are scheduled it also provides a pathway to extend calculus results to provide deterministic performance bounds wireless for the routing a design model is used that the routing protocol into components with separate design stability agility and flexibility are better achieved through architecture these solutions are still but they have well defined interfaces for signaling control information exchange between components and layers performance provide a systematic methodology to study and quantify the and sensitivity of the network performance to its parameters performance models provide a traceability mechanism connects the network requirements to the components and design abstractions and lead to the development of an effective modular design methodology for networks clique congestion metrics provide a promising and exciting venue to and develop novel traffic engineering algorithms for wireless the research will yield new principles and fundamental for the design performance evaluation and control of wireless networks the methodologies can be used to estimate capacity region of wireless networks the project will optimization algorithms and algorithms for computations the component based design model of the project applications to other areas of networking like vehicular and infrastructure faculty honored

professor shihab shamma assistant professor timothy professor john s baras professor krishnaprasad and professor cynthia moss are part a million defense advanced research projects darpa contract for intelligent and interfaces for acoustic sensors the goal of this contract is to formulate and implement signal processing systems and technology that can control and utilize the noisy mems sensor the university of maryland faculty are part of a research group includes johns hopkins university the university of australia and signal systems corp severna park the is part of acoustic microsensor technology project acoustic mems offer exciting opportunities for a wide of applications for robust sound detection analysis and in noisy environments the most important advance these sensors is the potential for fabricating and utilizing miniature and intelligent sensor elements and arrays in particular mems make possible for the first time to conceive of applications which arrays of interacting creating in effect distributed sensory fields to achieve this potential however it essential that these sensors be coupled to signal conditioning processing circuitry that can tolerate their inherent noise environmental sensitivity without sacrificing the unique advantages compactness and the fundamental challenge that we address in this proposal one that critical to any real application of mems sensors is how to design and implement signal processing systems and technology that adapt control and utilize the noisy mems sensor more specifically we will focus our technology transition efforts developing a smart microphone suitable for outdoor surveillance on robotic vehicles this smart microphone incorporate mems sensors for acoustic sensing wind noise turbulence sensing platform vibration sensing and a analog very large scale integration adaptive these intelligent and noise robust interface capabilities will enable new class of small effective surveillance sensors sensor interfaces and noise reduction circuits will be small enough be mounted on future robots our interfaces will consume less than current systems by including silicon cochlea based classification and localization processing these sensors can acoustic surveillance the resulting smart technology will be very power efficient enabling a networked array autonomous sensors that can be integrated miniaturized robots or deployed by we envision such a sensory processing system to be fully with sophisticated capabilities beyond the passive sound reception typical microphones smart mems sensors may possess a wide range intelligent capabilities depending on the specific application they may simply extract and transmit elementary acoustic sound loudness pitch or location or learn and perform decisions and to achieve these goals we propose to develop and utilize technologies that can perform these functions robustly and at extremely low power an equally important innovation will be formulation of algorithms that are intrinsically matched to characteristic strengths and weaknesses of the technology theoretical and technological innovations are fully intertwined in proposed research program and we believe that both approaches must developed simultaneously so as to achieve truly functional smart sensory systems that exploit the potential of acoustic mems the fundamental innovative thrust of our work focuses on development of biomimetic auditory interfaces and algorithms and implementations an analog or hybrid vlsi poovendran win integrated security services professor john s baras

management the goal is to realize the vision of integrated access control authentication and architecture to support dynamic consisting of varied members with diverse interests and administrative the contract has been awarded under program on assurance and survivability dynamic coalitions section the project for the period march to march and the contract award funds are the goal will achieved by providing an integrated set of security policies services for different system platforms network infrastructures applications and by demonstrating new security currently this goal has not been attainable because the inability to represent negotiate and enforce a security policy across multiple system platforms and infrastructures the lack of secure services and particularly efficient and security policies enable management of group access rights within time constraints the absence of visual tools for security definition and the university of maryland team believes that the ability to coalitions with diverse and rapidly changing membership is an enabler for a multitude of applications in national defense and commerce to address the dynamic coalition problem our team analyze fundamental properties of and provide tools and servers security policy representation negotiation and enforcement different system platforms pki and including frequent distribution review and revocation certificates and access rights our team will also analyze properties of secure including scalable generation efficient and robust for frequent member joins and departures we will develop a

stories americas usa boeing eads europe eu europe other issues lobbying power projection rumours russia specialty aircraft articles transport latest updates preliminary design review passed to kc kc old as the click to view focus articles cover major weapons acquisition programs and program is more important to the usaf than its aerial tanker renewal in january the big question was whether there be a competition for the proposal covering aircraft and test platforms the total cost for this first alone will exceed billion but aerial tanker demands new planes to replace its whose most recent delivery was in otherwise unpredictable age or fatigue like the ones that grounded its fighters in ground its aerial tankers and with them a substantial slice of total and contracts may follow in subsequent decades in order replace all active ang reserve active as well as the heavy kc tankers that were delivered then again fiscal and demographic realities may mean the plane buy is it for the usaf either way the were huge for all in the end it was team kc vs eads north airbus both within the pentagon and in the halls of congress the and employment stakes guaranteed a huge political fight no matter side won a fight that ended up sinking and restarting the program after airbus won in february three years later won the recompete now it has to the the the development the production and its team rfp contracts key developments appendix a rfp the new appendix b the contenders and the cargo factor appendix c airbus additional the program overview a march gao report summed up the risk

average about of age with more than flight hours on each and their life is expected to end around us debating aerial tanker types mix offers coverage the to the rfp explaining many of the military issues in play as the usa contemplates its own choices then came contractor decisions and responses what would boeing propose kc the kc or both would northrop and eads elect to bringing their airbus in the end round was team kc advanced derivative vs team northrop victorious each aircraft system has its strengths and system also had risk factors as lobbying continued right down to wire boeing claimed lower kc operating costs and received a endorsement eads promised to open production of civilian jets the usa if it the airbus a mrtt was picked as the but an explosive decision brought the competition to a usaf articles took pains to emphasize that the department has through a rigorous review process for and has validated that rfp accurately reflects the requirements as laid out by warfighter the rfp includes specific factors for assessing capability contribution of each offeror along a set of performance that did not stop the contract protests of course and revelations that the usaf had not even followed its own destroyed the the clock ran out on the bush tenure and secretary defense gates decided to give his new employers in the administration an opportunity to chart their own course on this the competition was canceled a rfp was released february but the decision took until february based won that competition and the way they it was simple they underbid on a contract by hundred million dollars below cost in exchange they avoided a dent their prestige kept their production line open opened the door more kc exports ensured a lucrative stream of future maintenance revenue and prevented airbus from gaining a industrial foothold in the development usaf research and development the latest selected acquisition report estimates a development costs of billion which would actually be billion over the emd original target cost of fortunately for the usaf they structured the contract so they pay more than billion and the overall bid cost to the government for development plus production remains below how it up to billion the contract split for amounts over billion is so the government pays million more billion and boeing pays costs above billion are all

correctly seen toxic the result is grave difficulty in budget planning as programs are sacrificed or compromised in order to pay for in fairness to boeing worth going back to the original bids reports right after the february award had eads bidding billion for the emd phase while boeing had bid billion for the emd phase alone that means the usaf knew of about million beyond its target costs from the outset for an aircraft had not been fielded or tested yet and involved more development than offering that means added risk of future increases but swiftness of these cost revisions strongly

compared to the costs associated with a procurement strategy our product is better congressmen murtha and abercrombie are correct the only way to tankers to the warfighter quickly is through a dual strategy northrop grumman will support the the crunch of course is that more aircraft per year at about million each adds billion per year to actual spending another billion from or billion from the

reports that boeing is considering a refusal to bid as its response to the revised that response would leave the field open to grumman in formal sense but the political weight of that kind of protest would force the pentagon to think long and hard before signing contract under those circumstances until boeing makes a firm of course its bid team must continue working full speed aug new draft the

original evaluation approach the announced approach instead of a violation of the under those terms boeing is likely to lose again which may trigger protest upon the release of the revised rfp the planned line for moving forward is as aug dod officials will take a week to discuss elements of draft with and boeing expect a lot of back forth over the terms of the rfp including efforts by members

clear winner at more payload more and more patients than the at billion plus the dollars associated with the buy are huge and the profits reaped from the sale will available for reinvestment by the

how first of all get the right capability we especially wanted make sure that request for a proposal we put out there for a product that we wanted not for a product that ensured competition but for a product we wanted and we worked a lot that over the period thinking about it not only from an air perspective but from a joint perspective as well and i mean feel pretty good about where it came out it was that transparent a development of an rfp as one could ever look always like a competition but having to have competition for something i want is not of interest and know when down to handfuls of always working that balance more competition better than less competition but to have to go to a competition something you want then sends you off into an environment want to be in when we did the mobility capability study one of the we came to as we looked at alternatives in that space was that the nation looked at a tanker that if the price was for doors and floors that the agility that that would create terms of being able to have additional palette additional personnel capability pick up some medical capability additional flexibility in lift that know we do a but in any operation the capability to do palettes and people through more varied types of airplanes was worth a fair amount it building a tanker for but if you could get it for a investment it made a lot of sense to do it by the right now sending lots of palettes to places around the lots of palettes to the theater in particular moving lots people back and forth some of on commercial carriers of on some of hopping on it was very clear not in the first seven days of the conflict the first limited engagement because at that time tankers are their tanker mean principally tankers to be in a sustaining operation over time agility that being able to make them a cargo long as are trying to optimize the airplane as a cargo agility made a lot of sense inherently and analytically pallets on a c is extremely inefficient mean for large cargo not for consider in light of the lexington november fate of huge tanker program could hinge on cargo role however that krieg is still performing the balancing act implementation of his

was simpler and more straightforward get at a majority share of the tanker the usaf stated its opposition to a proposal many times worked hard to avoid that outcome they might have been convinced pay that price if they believe that the alternative would be a that remains stalled for a long time events showed them moving that conclusion albeit slowly and fitfully but then the round came out with a clear winner take all the round rfp certainly clarifies the nature of the round featured mandatory requirements and requirements that could affect evaluations round reverses ratio with go to war on day requirements that must be met qualify and trade space requirements that earn extra the resulting rfp is best described as a competition using bids worthy of note that prices entirely fixed for good reason imagine for that the us dollar devalued sharply over the life imported materials became more expensive or inflation skyrocketed labor rates changed accordingly forcing the manufacturers to those losses would be unfair and could induce serious problems for the company provision provides a for adjusting prices if key inputs fluctuate in order to create adjusted payment price with this safety valve acknowledged bids as submitted will form the those bids are just the starting point total adjusted price reflects bid price as adjusted through main filters the same model used in round to evaluate the contenders fuel efficiency military the ifara model will use updated scenarios to cover the expected of contingencies and there are several ways to have adjusted a larger plane that could cover a given scenario with planes for instance might get its tap lowered a smaller might gain under another scenario where range basing and suit it better those adjustments will be summed and fuel burn will use average flight hours per year rather than round as is the actual average flown by the kc fleet date this may seem to disadvantage the kc slightly but another key variable that makes the effect far less clear fuel will also use the mission profiles and mission percentages laid out the ifara model again contenders will have their bid price accordingly depending on their estimated fuel burn costs a year for military construction the usaf picked relevant kc bases which are not necessarily the future homes since separate decision aircraft that would require changes or to ramps taxiways runways hangars at those air bases would their bid price changed accordingly in their tap actual aircraft the submitted types will be used at these locations in order to the if more than difference in the taps the government buys airplane which is exactly what happened if there had or less difference the usaf would have been directed to look at optional trade space requirements and their accompanying adjusting the tap accordingly and then buy the each trade space item is worth a certain number of points and either met or not met the one exception is fuel offload which between points as different levels of capability are total extra weight is therefore there are total space points which includes requirements worth points each worth points worth point worth points and points the result would be a new adjusted price and again bid because ifara also ties into fuel burn and additional range and offload capacity do not factor in except through ifara the ifara looked set to be the hinge on which this competition will turn addition all qualified bid teams will have access to the ifara which means one could expect arguments about some of the once the contending teams have crunched their performance through models and gone over the criteria instead boeing decided to more less nullify ifara with a bid price that rendered it on another likely lobbying front the rfp took no with respect to the ongoing trade subsidies dispute the world trade organization this refusal is explicitly stated was fiercely defended and maintain the rfp does include the clause it states that any financial or other assessed by the wto are entirely the responsibility cannot be passed on to the usaf in any b the contenders and the cargo factor air kc cargo usaf click to view during the round competition a was against in a new wrinkle air mobility command brought into the rfp draft process and the usaf said the air force also intends to take full advantage of the capabilities inherent in the platform and make it an integral of the defense transportation both contending aircraft offer substantial improvements over extra capacity for cargo or people in addition to tanker the can carry up to standard l cargo pallets or about medical litters just under of american aerial currently carry cargo loads but that number is likely to increase existing aerial tanker fleet is being handled gently given its age the consequences of structural issues once those issues are however the frequency of current c flights involving people standard pallets rather than heavy cargo will make more flights an attractive despite the fuel a mrtt thales airtanker a mrtt click to view according to the kc official round pdf the derivative can carry up to passengers or medical litters or up to standard l cargo pallets or combination of the above in addition to its full fuel load at pounds capacity it also carries more fuel than the is a particular advantage in the pacific sector with its expanses on the other hand its advanced arbs refueling boom did not actually transfer fuel another aircraft in the air until march competition delays allowed airbus to improve this gap and an a conducted refueling in on the flip side the kc is a larger aircraft than the requires a slightly longer runway at full load takes up footprint on tarmacs and costs more to operate on basis in response team kc stresses costs and on a basis such as deploying a full fighter squadron personnel and equipment or deploying an army combat team transport aircraft with tanker accompaniment they argue that if tanker aircraft with more fuel and cargo space mean fewer required the cost figures may look more equal once the mission tankers are supporting is complete there had also been speculation that airbus might be prepared to offer a very discounted price in order to close the buying price gap between cheaper and the some reports even pegged kc offer as the rfps included more exacting data as each team made its case to usaf as well as final pricing for example fleet effectiveness fev one of the key evaluation criteria designed to communicate aerial refueling performance the kc fleet is the baseline with an fev of calculated over mission scenarios specified by the usaf and using prescribed ramp space and resources air mobility sector paul meyer says the fev submitted with its kc round bid was there had been some talk at northrop grumman of using the freighter version instead as the base aircraft which would be departure from bought to date a switch would add new risk and certification issues as well as fuel efficiency penalties exchange for much better cargo performance aircraft pounds of weight to the base design and fuel capacity by us gallons in exchange for boosting weight capacity by pounds to the type first flew late and began service with uae eithad airways in so far the f has only been suggested as a improvement or variant option after the contract is kc kc pub kc kc round click to view team kc advanced in round used a fuselage freighter wing landing gear cargo door and floor and flaps and flight deck derived in turn from the a boom with remote viewing would expand the effective refueling airspace and offload more fuel engines would be pratt whitney with pounds of thrust the advanced refueling boom had a and had been tested successfully in live refueling night operations on the other hand was a technical risk factor that had undergone almost years redesign and been a persistent problem for the italian tanker that was a potential risk and round optimization had penalized boeing due to the additional risk and certification their kc newgen now the is a sharp contrast as decided not to discuss their features a stance it maintained even after the award this made assessments of round offering inexact and approximate earlier round comments boeing indicated a more standard but pictures and videos appear show lengthened wings and wingtip winglets in order to deal previous flutter issues and add cruise efficiency what is known that boeing is keeping the pw engines the firm still says using a new boom design but the structure is now based the larger kc boom in order to meet the fuel offload target at the same time refueling pods replaced by the same cobham products found on the a mrtt the clear change involved replacement of the derived deck with one from the new dreamliner that includes flight display as their relative capacities demonstrate the kc is a aircraft than the one positive consequence is that it can off from slightly shorter runways the usaf requires the ability take off from an foot runway but would prefer feet as makes more runways available the size can also mean difference between say or aircraft that can fit on the tarmac a forward base boeing touts the kc as cheaper to and maintain than the kc on a basis and its base is cheaper to buy on the civilian based planes can carry up to passengers vs or medical litters ngc patients claim or up to standard l cargo pallets or combination of the above in addition to its full fuel load that is confirmed at pounds slightly above the the claims that its strengthened floors allow the kc to carry a weight of cargo to the a however it would be interesting to validated statistics compared to the boeing could have the in round which is feet longer but their determined that the extra capacity justify the extra and operating expenses that turned out to be a mistake but proceeded to win round with a freighter northrop grumman calculated a round fleet effectiveness value of for the rival kc in round vs for airbus boeing did not release its kc and kc kc refuels click to view for round boeing was openly contemplating a kc depending on the criteria weightings a kc would offer more offloaded fuel than the at nautical with the ability to carry up to passengers vs kc patients vs kc or up to standard l pallets vs kc or some combination of the above addition to its full fuel these statistics are impressive but boeing would have faced hurdles if it wished to offer a one is the cost given the way the rfp is structured has almost certainly run the ifara model to make sure but on the of it the renewed rfp made a kc offering unlikely the on cost and lower value placed on extra points for the additional cargo transport and fuel capabilities made the look like a losing game the nd issue was timeliness unlike kc and a mrtt any kc would have to be designed tested and certified from scratch to add to that timeliness boeing already has a backlog of commercial orders for the that issue leaves boeing with choices that include some combination adding time and risk by investing or partnering to expand production rate convincing commercial customers to accept delays facing constraints on their delivery rate to the kc conversion and in the end those hurdles convinced boeing to offer the kc again with modifications that made it different from the flying for japan and c airbus lost round a mrtt raaf conversion raaf a click to view before its win the mrtt had been ordered by saudi arabia and the united arab emirates as well as unusual
