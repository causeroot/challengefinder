Title: |
    The Arimaa Challenge
Post Date: |
    April 27th, 2012
Deadline: |
    January, 2013
    Note: Deadline for initial Tournament Submission
Award: |
    $17,000
Description: |
    The first person, company or organization that develops a program which can defeat the top human Arimaa players in an official Arimaa challenge match before the year 2020 will win the Arimaa challenge prize. The official challenge match will be between the current best program and three selected human players. 
Rules: |
    Challenge Details: The Arimaa challenge match will consist of 9 games using the 2/6/100/0/8/6 time control. Each of the three players will play a three game series against the program. The program must demonstrate that it can win at least two of the three games against each of the human players to win the challenge. The program can select which color to play in the first game and the remaining games will be played with alternating color. All games are played according to the Arimaa Match Rules. The games will be played over the Internet in the Arimaa gameroom and will be viewable by the public while they are in progress. The best program will be running on the same computer system as that used in the computer championship games. It will be run under the control of the match coordinator with guidance from the match director. The director may send a representative to be present with the human player during the games. The director may also use a webcam to monitor the human player during the games. A representative from the best program may also be present with the human player. The human player may use an aid such as a physical game board or a computer program so that pieces can be moved to assist in planning a move. No aid may be used which suggests a move or provides any information about the move aside from the position score defined in the Arimaa match rules. The human player must be isolated from discussions of the game while the game is in session. Between games the human players may study the past games. The best program may not be manually altered during or between the challenge games. Also it cannot be manually altered between the computer championship games and the start of the challenge match. If requested the program can be allowed to run in between the games so that it can study the past games and modify itself as long as this is an automated function.
    
    Challenge Schedule: No more than one game will be played per day by any one player. The three players will alternate so that one player has not played two or more games than another. The program team must notify the tournament director what color they wish to play in the first game before start of the match. The selected players must also submit their schedule to the tournament director before the start of the match. The exact schedule specifying the dates times and the player for each game will be determined and posted shortly before the match begins.
    
    Hardware and OS: The hardware and OS that will be used in the Arimaa challenge will be the same as that used in the computer championship. The hardware will typically be a standard general purpose computer that can be purchased within $1000 USD. The OS used for the Arimaa challenge will be a version of the Linux OS.
    
    Selection of the best program: The two programs which finished first and second in the 2012 World Computer Championship will compete in a preliminary for the right to play in the Arimaa challenge match. The two programs will be made available online for humans to play against for a duration of at least two weeks and not more than four weeks. This is referred to as the screening period. Any human player that wants to play against the programs must play both programs equally in terms of number of times and color. A human player must not play more than two times against either program and no more than one time with the same color. Thus, if a human player plays program A as gold, the player must then play program B as gold. The program which has a better record after the screening period will go on to play in the challenge match. In case of a tie the program which won the computer championship will go on to play in the challenge match. The games will be played using the 2/6/100/0/8/6 time control.
    
    The human players that will be playing in the challenge match must not play against the programs during this time. Also developers of the two programs may not play the programs during this time. The match director may disqualify the games of any player if it appears that a game was intentionally lost in order to distort the standings.
    
    Selection of the human players: Omar and Aamir Syed will choose three human players that will play in the challenge match against the best program. The players will be chosen from among the top rated Arimaa players. A first and second backup player will also be chosen so that if any of the main players is not able to play any of the games, the backup players can substitute. The name of the human players and backup players will be submitted to the match director before the start of the computer championship. The names of these players will be announced publicly after the computer championship tournament is completed.
    
    Intent of the challenge: The main intent of the Arimaa challenge is to promote research in AI, which can help to advance the field and potentially have applications in other areas. Some areas of AI that would be involved depending on the approach taken include pattern recognition, machine learning, neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, and expert systems. It is hoped that in the processes of achieving the Arimaa challenge some new techniques are developed in one or more of these areas that can also be applied to other problems. The Arimaa challenge is designed to be met if significant progress is made in software and not from the advances in hardware, which are almost guaranteed. As such the challenge will define the hardware and OS to be used and participants need only to develop the software.
    
    Advancing the state of the art: As mentioned above the intent of the Arimaa challenge is to help advance research in areas of AI. Thus, it is recommended that the participants (especially those with programs in the computer tournament) submit articles to the ICGA technical journal describing their research and results. If a program wins the Arimaa challenge, it must be described in a paper submitted to the ICGA technical journal after winning the challenge in order to receive any prize.
    
    Technical Problems: Technical failures on Arimaa.com during challenge match games will be remediated as follows:
    
        Once a player has started the next game of the player's series, the results of previous games in the player's series can't be altered, no matter what issue is discovered.
        If it is determined during a game that either bot or human player has suffered a disadvantage, the game will be immediately halted, made unrated, and resumed from the point at which the disadvantage first occurred. The game must be halted regardless of whether the disadvantaged player is winning or losing.
        If it is determined after a game is over, but before the next game of the player's series, that either bot or human player has suffered a disadvantage, the game result will be invalidated, the game will be made unrated, and the game will be replayed from the point at which the disadvantage first occurred. The game must be replayed whether the disadvantaged player won or lost.
        Disadvantages that warrant a game being halted and/or replayed include, but are not limited to:
            Extraneous processes running on the bot's server
            The game server failing to receive a move sent by a bot or human player
            Either bot or human player not receiving a move sent by the game server
            A bot being restarted mid-move by the tournament server
            A bot being misconfigured by the tournament coordinator 
        The tournament director decides whether technical failures not on this list warrant halting and/or replaying games.
        When restarting games from a specific position, the tournament coordinator will attempt to restore the clock state (reserve times and game time) as closely as possible to the state at the time the issue occurred. 
    
    Notes:
    
        The match coordinator will carry out the match in compliance with the stated rules and does not make any decisions that will effect the course of the match. In special situations the match coordinator will follow the decision of the match director.
        The role of the match director will be to oversee that the Arimaa challenge match is being conducted according to the stated rules and to serve as the arbitrator in case of disputes. Should a dispute arise about the outcome of a particular game, the director will review the logs produced during the game and decide if the game should be replayed.
        The director may require any player to have a web-cam turned on for monitoring during the games. Also the director may send a representative to be present with any player during the games.
        All decisions made by the director shall be considered final and binding by all parties.
        Omar and Aamir Syed reserve the rights to modify the challenge details in the future to resolve any logistical problems that may arise.

    Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture
Post Date: |

Deadline: |

Award: |
    $1,000,000
Description: |
    Mathematicians have always been fascinated by the problem of describing all solutions in whole numbers x,y,z to algebraic equations like x^2 + y^2 = z^2. Euclid gave the complete solution for that equation, but for more complicated equations this becomes extremely difficult. Indeed, in 1970 Yu. V. Matiyasevich showed that Hilbert's tenth problem is unsolvable, i.e., there is no general method for determining when such equations have a solution in whole numbers. But in special cases one can hope to say something. When the solutions are the points of an abelian variety, the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture asserts that the size of the group of rational points is related to the behavior of an associated zeta function ζ(s) near the point s=1. In particular this amazing conjecture asserts that if ζ(1) is equal to 0, then there are an infinite number of rational points (solutions), and conversely, if ζ(1) is not equal to 0, then there is only a finite number of such points.
Rules: |
    The Clay Mathematics Institute (CMI) of Cambridge, Massachusetts has named seven "Millennium Prize Problems." The Scientific Advisory Board of CMI (SAB) selected these problems, focusing on important classic questions that have resisted solution over the years. The Board of Directors of CMI designated a $7 million prize fund for the solution to these problems, with $1 million allocated to each. The Directors of CMI, and no other persons or body, have the authority to authorize payment from this fund or to modify or interpret these stipulations. The Board of Directors of CMI makes all mathematical decisions for CMI, upon the recommendation of its SAB.
    
    The SAB of CMI will consider a proposed solution to a Millennium Prize Problem if it is a complete mathematical solution to one of the problems. (In the case that someone discovers a mathematical counterexample, rather than a proof, the question will be considered separately as described below.) A proposed solution to one of the Millennium Prize Problems may not be submitted directly to CMI for consideration.
    
    Before consideration, a proposed solution must be published in a refereed mathematics publication of worldwide repute (or such other form as the SAB shall determine qualifies), and it must also have general acceptance in the mathematics community two years after. Following this two-year waiting period, the SAB will decide whether a solution merits detailed consideration. In the affirmative case, the SAB will constitute a special advisory committee, which will include (a) at least one SAB member and (b) at least two non-SAB members who are experts in the area of the problem. The SAB will seek advice to determine potential non-SAB members who are internationally-recognized mathematical experts in the area of the problem. As part of this procedure, each component of a proposed solution under consideration shall be verified by one or more members of this special advisory committee.
    
    The special advisory committee will report within a reasonable time to the SAB. Based on this report and possible further investigation, the SAB will make a recommendation to the Directors. The SAB may recommend the award of a prize to one person. The SAB may recommend that a particular prize be divided among multiple solvers of a problem or their heirs. The SAB will pay special attention to the question of whether a prize solution depends crucially on insights published prior to the solution under consideration. The SAB may (but need not) recommend recognition of such prior work in the prize citation, and it may (but need not) recommend the inclusion of the author of prior work in the award.
    
    If the SAB cannot come to a clear decision about the correctness of a solution to a problem, its attribution, or the appropriateness of an award, the SAB may recommend that no prize be awarded for a particular problem. If new information comes to light, the SAB may (but will not necessarily) reconsider a negative decision to recommend a prize for a proposed solution, but only after an additional two-year waiting period following the time that the new information comes to light. The SAB has the sole authority to make recommendations to the Directors of the CMI concerning the appropriateness of any award and the validity of any claim to the CMI Millennium Prize.
    
    In the case of the P versus NP problem and the Navier-Stokes problem, the SAB will consider the award of the Millennium Prize for deciding the question in either direction. In the case of the other problems if a counterexample is proposed, the SAB will consider this counterexample after publication and the same two-year waiting period as for a proposed solution will apply. If, in the opinion of the SAB, the counterexample effectively resolves the problem then the SAB may recommend the award of the Prize. If the counterexample shows that the original problem survives after reformulation or elimination of some special case, then the SAB may recommend that a small prize be awarded to the author. The money for this prize will not be taken from the Millennium Prize Problem fund, but from other CMI funds.
    
    Any person who is not a disqualified person (as that term is defined in section 4946 of the Internal Revenue Code) in connection with the Institute, or a then serving member of the SAB, may receive the Millennium Prize.
    
    All decision-making procedures concerning the CMI Millennium Prize Problems are private. This includes the deliberations or recommendations of any person or persons CMI has used to obtain advice on this question. No records of these deliberations or related correspondence may be made public without the prior approval of the Directors, the SAB, and all other living persons involved, unless fifty years time have elapsed after the event in question.
    
    Notwithstanding the wording of the problem descriptions, the SAB will not consider recommending the award of a prize to any individual who has not, in the judgement of SAB, made a major personal contribution to the understanding of the field of the problem in their published solution; nor will it investigate in detail solutions that do not represent a major advance in the field. Conversely, the SAB may consider recommending the award of the prize to an individual who has published work that, in the judgement of the SAB, fully resolves the questions raised by one of the Millennium Prize Problems even if it does not exactly meet the wording in the official problem description.

    $1,000,000
Description: |
    In the twentieth century mathematicians discovered powerful ways to investigate the shapes of complicated objects. The basic idea is to ask to what extent we can approximate the shape of a given object by gluing together simple geometric building blocks of increasing dimension. This technique turned out to be so useful that it got generalized in many different ways, eventually leading to powerful tools that enabled mathematicians to make great progress in cataloging the variety of objects they encountered in their investigations. Unfortunately, the geometric origins of the procedure became obscured in this generalization. In some sense it was necessary to add pieces that did not have any geometric interpretation. The Hodge conjecture asserts that for particularly nice types of spaces called projective algebraic varieties, the pieces called Hodge cycles are actually (rational linear) combinations of geometric pieces called algebraic cycles.

Description: |
    Waves follow our boat as we meander across the lake, and turbulent air currents follow our flight in a modern jet. Mathematicians and physicists believe that an explanation for and the prediction of both the breeze and the turbulence can be found through an understanding of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations. Although these equations were written down in the 19th Century, our understanding of them remains minimal. The challenge is to make substantial progress toward a mathematical theory which will unlock the secrets hidden in the Navier-Stokes equations.

Description: |
    Suppose that you are organizing housing accommodations for a group of four hundred university students. Space is limited and only one hundred of the students will receive places in the dormitory. To complicate matters, the Dean has provided you with a list of pairs of incompatible students, and requested that no pair from this list appear in your final choice. This is an example of what computer scientists call an NP-problem, since it is easy to check if a given choice of one hundred students proposed by a coworker is satisfactory (i.e., no pair taken from your coworker's list also appears on the list from the Dean's office), however the task of generating such a list from scratch seems to be so hard as to be completely impractical. Indeed, the total number of ways of choosing one hundred students from the four hundred applicants is greater than the number of atoms in the known universe! Thus no future civilization could ever hope to build a supercomputer capable of solving the problem by brute force; that is, by checking every possible combination of 100 students. However, this apparent difficulty may only reflect the lack of ingenuity of your programmer. In fact, one of the outstanding problems in computer science is determining whether questions exist whose answer can be quickly checked, but which require an impossibly long time to solve by any direct procedure. Problems like the one listed above certainly seem to be of this kind, but so far no one has managed to prove that any of them really are so hard as they appear, i.e., that there really is no feasible way to generate an answer with the help of a computer. Stephen Cook and Leonid Levin formulated the P (i.e., easy to find) versus NP (i.e., easy to check) problem independently in 1971.

The Board of Directors of CMI makes all mathematical decisions for CMI, upon the recommendation of its SAB.
    
    The SAB of CMI will consider a proposed solution to a Millennium Prize Problem if it is a complete mathematical solution to one of the problems. (In the case that someone discovers a mathematical counterexample, rather than a proof, the question will be considered separately as described below.) A proposed solution to one of the Millennium Prize Problems may not be submitted directly to CMI for consideration.
    
    Before consideration, a proposed solution must be published in a refereed mathematics publication of worldwide repute (or such other form as the SAB shall determine qualifies), and it must also have general acceptance in the mathematics community two years after. Following this two-year waiting period, the SAB will decide whether a solution merits detailed consideration. In the affirmative case, the SAB will constitute a special advisory committee, which will include (a) at least one SAB member and (b) at least two non-SAB members who are experts in the area of the problem. The SAB will seek advice to determine potential non-SAB members who are internationally-recognized mathematical experts in the area of the problem. As part of this procedure, each component of a proposed solution under consideration shall be verified by one or more members of this special advisory committee.
    
    The special advisory committee will report within a reasonable time to the SAB. Based on this report and possible further investigation, the SAB will make a recommendation to the Directors. The SAB may recommend the award of a prize to one person. The SAB may recommend that a particular prize be divided among multiple solvers of a problem or their heirs. The SAB will pay special attention to the question of whether a prize solution depends crucially on insights published prior to the solution under consideration. The SAB may (but need not) recommend recognition of such prior work in the prize citation, and it may (but need not) recommend the inclusion of the author of prior work in the award.
    
    If the SAB cannot come to a clear decision about the correctness of a solution to a problem, its attribution, or the appropriateness of an award, the SAB may recommend that no prize be awarded for a particular problem. If new information comes to light, the SAB may (but will not necessarily) reconsider a negative decision to recommend a prize for a proposed solution, but only after an additional two-year waiting period following the time that the new information comes to light. The SAB has the sole authority to make recommendations to the Directors of the CMI concerning the appropriateness of any award and the validity of any claim to the CMI Millennium Prize.
    
    In the case of the P versus NP problem and the Navier-Stokes problem, the SAB will consider the award of the Millennium Prize for deciding the question in either direction. In the case of the other problems if a counterexample is proposed, the SAB will consider this counterexample after publication and the same two-year waiting period as for a proposed solution will apply. If, in the opinion of the SAB, the counterexample effectively resolves the problem then the SAB may recommend the award of the Prize. If the counterexample shows that the original problem survives after reformulation or elimination of some special case, then the SAB may recommend that a small prize be awarded to the author. The money for this prize will not be taken from the Millennium Prize Problem fund, but from other CMI funds.
    
    Any person who is not a disqualified person (as that term is defined in section 4946 of the Internal Revenue Code) in connection with the Institute, or a then serving member of the SAB, may receive the Millennium Prize.
    
    All decision-making procedures concerning the CMI Millennium Prize Problems are private. This includes the deliberations or recommendations of any person or persons CMI has used to obtain advice on this question. No records of these deliberations or related correspondence may be made public without the prior approval of the Directors, the SAB, and all other living persons involved, unless fifty years time have elapsed after the event in question.
    
    Notwithstanding the wording of the problem descriptions, the SAB will not consider recommending the award of a prize to any individual who has not, in the judgement of SAB, made a major personal contribution to the understanding of the field of the problem in their published solution; nor will it investigate in detail solutions that do not represent a major advance in the field. Conversely, the SAB may consider recommending the award of the prize to an individual who has published work that, in the judgement of the SAB, fully resolves the questions raised by one of the Millennium Prize Problems even if it does not exactly meet the wording in the official problem description.

Description: |
    Some numbers have the special property that they cannot be expressed as the product of two smaller numbers, e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, etc. Such numbers are called prime numbers, and they play an important role, both in pure mathematics and its applications. The distribution of such prime numbers among all natural numbers does not follow any regular pattern, however the German mathematician G.F.B. Riemann (1826 - 1866) observed that the frequency of prime numbers is very closely related to the behavior of an elaborate function
    
        ζ(s) = 1 + (1/2)^s + (1/3)^s + (1/4)^s + ...
    
    called the Riemann Zeta function. The Riemann hypothesis asserts that all interesting solutions of the equation
    
        ζ(s) = 0
    
    lie on a certain vertical straight line. This has been checked for the first 1,500,000,000 solutions. A proof that it is true for every interesting solution would shed light on many of the mysteries surrounding the distribution of prime numbers.

    Yang-Mills and Mass Gap

Award: |
    $1,000,000
Description: |
    The laws of quantum physics stand to the world of elementary particles in the way that Newton's laws of classical mechanics stand to the macroscopic world. Almost half a century ago, Yang and Mills introduced a remarkable new framework to describe elementary particles using structures that also occur in geometry. Quantum Yang-Mills theory is now the foundation of most of elementary particle theory, and its predictions have been tested at many experimental laboratories, but its mathematical foundation is still unclear. The successful use of Yang-Mills theory to describe the strong interactions of elementary particles depends on a subtle quantum mechanical property called the "mass gap:" the quantum particles have positive masses, even though the classical waves travel at the speed of light. This property has been discovered by physicists from experiment and confirmed by computer simulations, but it still has not been understood from a theoretical point of view. Progress in establishing the existence of the Yang-Mills theory and a mass gap and will require the introduction of fundamental new ideas both in physics and in mathematics.

Title: |
    The Huntter Prize
Post Date: |
    August 6th, 2006
Deadline: |
    None
Award: |
    Variable (see Description)
Description: |
    The Hutter Prize is a cash prize funded by Marcus Hutter which rewards data compression improvements on a specific 100 MB English text file. Specifically, the prize awards 500 euros for each one percent improvement (with 50,000 euros total funding) in the compressed size of the file enwik8, which is the smaller of two files used in the Large Text Compression Benchmark; enwik8 is the first 100,000,000 characters of a specific version of English Wikipedia.
    
    The goal of the Hutter Prize is to encourage research in artificial intelligence (AI). The organizers believe that text compression and AI are equivalent problems. Hutter proved that the optimal behavior of a goal seeking agent in an unknown but computable environment is to guess at each step that the environment is probably controlled by one of the shortest programs consistent with all interaction so far. Unfortunately, there is no general solution because Kolmogorov complexity is not computable. Hutter proved that in the restricted case (called AIXItl) where the environment is restricted to time t and space l, that a solution can be computed in time O(t2l), which is still intractable.
    
    The organizers further believe that compressing natural language text is a hard AI problem, equivalent to passing the Turing test. Thus, progress toward one goal represents progress toward the other. They argue that predicting which characters are most likely to occur next in a text sequence requires vast real-world knowledge. A text compressor must solve the same problem in order to assign the shortest codes to the most likely text sequences.
Rules: |
    Rules:
    The contest is open ended. It is open to everyone. To enter, a competitor must submit a compression program and a decompressor that decompresses to the file enwik8.[2] It is also possible to submit a compressed file instead of the compression program. The total size of the compressed file and decompressor (as a Win32 or Linux executable) must not be larger than 99% of the previous prize winning entry. For each one percent improvement, the competitor wins 500 euros. The decompression program must also meet execution time and memory constraints, currently 10 hours on a 2 GHz Pentium 4 with 1 GB memory. These constraints may be relaxed in the future.
    
    Submissions must be published in order to allow independent verification. There is a 30 day waiting period for public comment before awarding a prize. The rules do not require the release of source code, unless such release is required by the code's license (as in the case of PAQ, which is licensed under GPL).
    
    Relaxations:
        In lieu of a self-extracting archive, a decompressor program decomp8.exe plus a compressed file archive8.bhm may be published, where decomp8.exe produces data8 from archive8.bhm. In this case, the total size is S := length(decomp8.exe)+length(archive8.bhm).
        In lieu of archive8, a compressor comp8.exe may be published, together with the size of archive8 (and possible options used to create it), which creates archive8 from enwik8.
        Resource restrictions for the (de)compressor are the same as for the self-extracting archive.
        The used filenames (except enwik8) are just for illustration.
        If your contribution violates some of the rules, you may still be eligible for the Large Compression Benchmark (see below).
    
    Participation:
    Anyone may participate at this contest by emailing the following information to matmahoney@yahoo.com:
    
        Name of program(s), version, and used options.
        Size of compressed enwik8, i.e. of archive8.exe or decomp8.exe+archive8.bhm.
        Approximate (de)compression time and memory used.
        Description of the test machine (processor, memory, operating system).
        Links where files can be downloaded.
    
    Any additional information, even if not complete, especially on the inner workings of the (de)compressor, the source code, etc, is highly appreciated.
    
    Award:
    The prize is awarded as follows:
    
        Award = Z×(L-S)/L, where
        S = new record (size of archive8.exe or decomp8.exe+archive8.bhm+opt),
        L = previous record for S,
        Z = amount in prize fund (currently 50'000€)
        Update: L := S.
        Minimum award is 3% of Z.
        Contributions are dealt with in the order of their submission.
        The contribution is subject to public comments for a period of at least 30 days before the prize is awarded.
    
    More Information:
        Compressors/decompressors do not have to be general purpose. They may be tuned specifically to this benchmark and are allowed to reject or fail on any input other than enwik8/archive8.bhm.
        Only the version and combination of options submitted is eligible for the prize.
        If an author breaks his own record within 30 days, the older submission is regarded as withdrawn.
        If a submission fails to meet the criteria for the prize, the entrant will be informed, and the submission henceforth be ignored. In particular a miss of the 3% criterion will not diminish the prize (L remains unchanged).
        If your compressor beats the current record, but violates some of the constraints regarding operating system, used dll's, used programming language, etc, Matt Mahoney may be willing to assist you in satisfying them. For instance if you send portable C code he can compile it under Windows for you.
        You can run some of the previous records on your system, and by comparing your runtime with the displayed runtime, you can estimate whether your algorithm will meet the time constraint on our machine.
        Members of the prize committee are not eligible for prize money. If a committee member publishes a (de)compressor that would have otherwise won prize money, then L is updated as in the normal case, but no money is paid.
        The above formula currently amounts to 1€ for every 330 byte improvement, with a minimum improvement of 494'449 bytes.
        If a decompressor has multiple authors, then a submission must include instructions for dividing the prize money. All authors must agree on this distribution before any money can be awarded.
        There will be a waiting period of at least 30 days after submission to allow for public comment and verification. Comments should be made to the Hutter Prize Newsgroup or by email to members of the Prize committee.
        The programs and/or data files must be available on the Internet for free download and testing.
        The (virtual) prize fund (Z) is constant. It is not decreased after awarding a prize. It may increase if additional sponsors contribute to it. (Please contact Marcus Hutter if you wish to contribute).
        The prize will be paid if the solution reflects the spirit of the contest. In particular decompressors (secretely) receiving any kind of "outside" information are forbidden. Also in order to verify your claim we need to be able to run your executable on our machines. Payment of the prize cannot be legally enforced. Marcus Hutter will make the final decision whether to recognize a record, award a prize, and the amount.
        Rules may change at any time without notice to meet the goals of fairness, accuracy, maximizing public participation, and recognizing existing practice.
        These rules are intensifications of Matt Mahoney's Large Compression Benchmark rules.

    3rd prize: $2,500
Description: |
     The Census Bureau invites you to participate in a prize competition.
    
        Create the best statistical model predicting census mail return rates at block group level geographies based on their demographic characteristics.
        Use information from the new Census Planning Database, a file of selected variables from the 2010 Census and 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) estimates.
    
    Census Bureau planners will use the winning model to develop appropriate strategies for respondent outreach and cooperation for timely and efficient data collection.
Rules: |
    
        One account per participant
    
        You cannot sign up to Kaggle from multiple accounts and therefore you cannot submit from multiple accounts.
        No private sharing outside teams
    
        Privately sharing code or data outside of teams is not permitted. It's OK to share code or data if made available to all players, such as on the forums.
        Team Mergers
    
        Team mergers are allowed but moderated.
        The Kaggle team will review any team merger request. Requests are generally rejected if the aggregate number of entries made by the merging teams exceeds the number of submissions permissable at the date of the merger request.
        Mergers are disallowed within 7 days of the competition deadline.
        Team Limits
    
        There is no maximum team size.
        Submission Limits
    
        You can submit a maximum of 2 entries per day.
    
        You can select up to 5 final submissions for judging.
    
    Rules additions (see https://www.kaggle.com/forums/t/2691/public-forum-for-private-allstate-competition):
    
        The Track10 map data and related return rate data are not eligible. No 2010 census return rate data if any kind is allowed.
        No outside data from after 2010 is allowed (would be using the future to predict the past).
        To prevent anyone from benefitting from disallowed data and trying to obscure that fact, final models (all code) must be posted publicly within 2 days of the end of the contest. Other contestants will then have 1 week to dispute the result, if anyone believes the posted code violates these rules.

Description: |
    The Qualcomm Tricorder X PRIZE is a $10 million global competition to stimulate innovation and integration of precision diagnostic technologies, making reliable health diagnoses available directly to "health consumers" in their homes.
    
    The dire need for improvements in health and healthcare in the U.S. has captured the attention of government, industry, and private citizens for years. But a viable solution has yet evaded one of the most technologically advanced, educated and prosperous nations on the globe. Integrated diagnostic technology, once available on a consumer mobile device that is easy to use, will allow individuals to incorporate health knowledge and decision-making into their daily lives.
    
    Advances in fields such as artificial intelligence, wireless sensing, imaging diagnostics, lab-on-a-chip, and molecular biology will enable better choices in when, where, and how individuals receive care, thus making healthcare more convenient, affordable, and accessible. The winner will be the team whose technology most accurately diagnoses a set of diseases independent of a healthcare professional or facility, and that provides the best consumer user experience with their device.
Rules: |
    As envisioned for this competition, the device will be a tool capable of capturing key health metrics and diagnosing a set of 15 diseases. Metrics for health could include such elements as blood pressure, respiratory rate, and temperature. Ultimately, this tool will collect large volumes of data from ongoing measurement of health states through a combination of wireless sensors, imaging technologies, and portable, non-invasive laboratory replacements.
    
    Given that each team will take its own approach to design and functionality, the device's physical appearance and functionality may vary immensely from team to team. Indeed, the only stated limit on form is that the mass of its components together must be no greater than five pounds. But because an important part of the qualifying round will be evaluating consumer experience in using it, the limitations set by this competition will force teams to make choices. Teams will have to consider tradeoffs amongst weight, functionality, power requirements, battery life, screen resolution, AI engine location, diagnosis capability, end consumer cost, and so on.
    
    Beyond the weight requirement, there is no limit as to how many discrete components constitute a viable solution. For example, teams may use sensors that are attached to a phone-like control unit, fastened individually to the consumer, or kept apart and reserved for occasional use or home monitoring. Similarly, teams may create a tool that has a large screen, a small screen, or perhaps even no screen (audio only). Systems must include a way for consumers to store and share their information, which must be accessible remotely via the Internet. Additionally, teams are expected to follow guidelines and protocols that help ensure that consumer safety is held in the highest regard. This includes avoiding harm from electrical energy, thermal energy, chemical exposures, needles, lancets, and infection
