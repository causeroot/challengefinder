http://abbeyrd.best.vwh.net/petebest.htm best of the pete best talks about his time with the beatles in a session in by gary thanks very much gary for this great i was thrilled to note from a local paper that pete best was at the king lynn arts centre on october this was not to be pete best band in concert but the former beatle alone on stage about his time with the beatles with an opportunity for the audience ask questions i hurried to book a ticket at the reasonable price and turned up bright and early at the historic yet cosy the audience was a cross section of ages and styles young types rubbing shoulders with original beatles fans and thirty the night began with an introduction from brother roag a from a local band pete had chosen and then pete took the stage to applause he looked very healthy and young slim with longish grey swept back of course and a the first half of the show was a lecture backed up slides many previously unseen and music extracts all familiar to covering two year stint with the beatles throughout session pete was witty and upbeat although i suspect he was a nervous he began by describing the forming of his first group blackjacks with his friend ken brown through whom he met john and george then known as the quarrymen the opening of the casbah in his cellar was well detailed and there were several of the original art which john and stuart sutcliffe had created for walls and ceiling amazingly the artwork survives to this day and was centrepiece of the reopening a short time ago pete said painted stars alone had been valued at each and his family waiting for the roof to fall in to grab pete recalled packed nights at the casbah club and his admiration the quarrymen cum beatles as their appearances continued he was of their lack of a permanent drummer and was not surprised when mccartney took an interest in him and his drum kit when the parted he auditioned and was immediately accepted as the group had pressing engagement to play clubs in hamburg germany a cramped in a van led to the group posing as students to gain admittance to country we learned about the competition between the liverpool to destroy club owners bruno koschmeider rickety stage it was with one just as cheap and the delights of viewing the ladies in the herbertstrasse best ever the infamous story of the burning condom used to boost lighting in groups windowless room was outlined in amusing detail as was pete subsequent deportation for this arson offence the that was building around the group was captured in of the welcome home gigs in liverpool especially the boosting receptions at the casbah and litherland town hall the leather outfits worn by the group and the hard sound initially liverpool fans to believe they were german being billed as fabulous beatles direct from hamburg several of the mysteries about the bert recording sessions were illuminated by eyewitness account i amused by the story of bert asking george if he knew the shadows frightened city and george confidently playing cry for a which bert accepted and recorded pete was proud of his efforts these recordings with the only downside being the tiny one off the group received the arrival of brian epstein led to an attempt smarten the groups act and pete displayed one of instructions to the group ordering them not to eat drink smoke swear on attempts to obtain a record deal seemed to bear fruition they were offered a session with decca on january laughingly recalled the bizarre occasion with the beatles celebrating new year until before turning up late and at decca for this important audition brian was furious you tell because his tie was undone and the group did themselves favours by giving a lacklustre performance pete though remains of some of the tracks with like dreamers do being his before emi beckoned there were more attempts by brian to broaden horizon the disastrous concert at aldershot attended by people was fondly recalled as were the frequent occasions when beatles backed big names like gene vincent and davy jones shots of the group looking uneasy in smart suits from spring fascinating as you help but look for ringo in the line ringo had cropped up earlier as pete mentioned their friendship drumming styles he got a big laugh from the audience by pretending forget the name of the beatles subsequent drummer frustratingly only briefly dwelt on his own singing spot during the appearances with the group but was questioned about this later fresh insight into love me do was forthcoming as pete revealed the original country style sound was inspired by the sadness the death of stuart sutcliffe the emi audition version was played pete to bear this pete dramatically ended the first half of the show with an account his dismissal from the group this was emphasised by letters disbelief from fans at the time which were displayed without his brother roag reappeared to announce that the question and session would follow shortly and encouraged us to get our audience pete sat on a stool very close to the front of the stage and questions pete took all questions and gave responses throughout i have not attempted to include every asked as i only noted down his approximate responses to memorable q you used to sing with the early beatles tell us about a it was originally bob idea who was the dj at the if you were in a group he reckoned you had to sing and drummers sang i never enjoyed singing the picture of me stage that i showed earlier was from a fan club night at the cavern also had to twist and sing joey peppermint twist that while paul took the drums it was embarrassing i wait to back behind the q how did you feel about anthology were you interviewed for the a i was approached about the use of the tracks which i appear and they also asked to use my image and likeness for the television was then all placed in the hands of the lawyers and i had no q did you ever follow their interest in eastern a i got there before them i was born in q who was the real leader of the beatles john or a i can only give my personal opinion based on my time in the band a leader was ever needed it was john he was the stronger q were you ever told the reasons for your a no but look at the theories i accept the theory as when we came back from germany other groups copied my using the loud bass drum also bert kaempfert was quite happy with drumming when we recorded in germany as for ringo being a drummer well he was replaced on love me do as well he hairstyle all rubbish it was never even discussed jealousy was aware of the pete best fans but there were plenty of paul fans as long as the group got the attention i was happy personality i part in all the crazy stunts and drinking i was a beatle a around the cavern was that it was because i turned down brian advances but i believe that unreliable i missed four shows over two years so if that makes me at the end of the day two people still alive know the reason we all read about it in the newspapers next year or we may never q did you ever think of asking for compensation or a a a few years later i had to bring a libel case as ringo said playboy magazine that i used to take pills to make me ill so i have to play the lawyers advised me to sue for loss of earnings well for the period up to christmas eventually the case settled out of court but the settlement was not q did you have any contact with beatles a on two occasions i appeared on the same bill as them with my band lee curtis and the all stars it was a stand off situation as came offstage and they were going on as they grew to the we all know the walls went up and they were hard to approach i bothered what was the q did you ever want to ring them up and say you a laughs many q do you think you will ever meet them a possible now back in show business what with the tours shows one day our paths might q is it true john sent a message years later saying he wanted to do with your a hunter davies spoke to john and that was the message that came john had said we were cowards when we sacked q what gave you the idea for these a in america the pete best band would play a concert and afterwards would be besieged with questions about my time with the group gave me the idea to do the informal sort of lecture q in your opinion who were the best of the liverpool a kingsize taylor and the dominoes they were the musicians group all wanted to q do you still see neil a about twice a year its very much a hello how you doing kinda q what did you think of the film a i enjoyed it but it was wrongly portrayed by the media it really the love story between stuart and astrid with us on q if you could have a one to one who would it be a john after an hour he took his leave but promised to return to autographs a bit later on true to his word he came back and autographs for everyone who wanted them many fans including me brought treasured items which he took great care to sign he posed for photographs a true in conclusion a memorable evening with pete revealing himself to be happy relaxed and all round pleasant guy it was obvious that retains happy memories of his days as a beatle a certain amount pride and undiminished affection for john lennon the first half professional well structured and informative the second half informal and truthful with pete clearly relishing the interplay and willing to answer absolutely anything

quick bread without eggs so i got nervous and one it came out fine the recipe may look odd but it turns nice i think the general idea of this cake especially without egg is for a honey spicey cakey brownie chewy and dense like brownie very yummy i iced mine with a simple confectioners sugar icing although its sweet enought without it also ommitted the candied fruit and added rasisins and almonds also think this cake would be nice with nothing rasins almond put too much icing if you use icing it will be too see full review dec an excellent recipe the dough out a bit dry like streusel by adding

connecticut league of art students hartford enrolling sometime between and in he working nights in order to paint in the daytime the following year transferred to the school of the art society of landscapes and seascapes of the early use the heavy impasto light palette and atmospheric mistiness of american impressionists ernest lawson and john henry twachtman his move to new york in where he encountered the work matisse and the work of picasso avery began simplify forms into broad areas of color although art became increasingly abstract he never abandoned subject matter painting figure groups still lifes landscapes seascapes his mature style developed by the characterized by a reduction of elements to their essential elimination of detail and surface patterns of flattened shapes with arbitrary color in the manner of early in career when social realism american scene painting were the prevailing artistic styles tendencies in his work were viewed by many as radical in the s a period dominated by expressionism he was overlooked by critics because of his adherence recognizable subject matter nevertheless his work with its on color was important to many younger artists particularly mark rothko adolph gottlieb barnett newman frankenthaler and other color field from patterson sims whitney museum of american art works from the permanent avery elemental or simplistic by don gray permission granted for inclusion in the artchive see of mr art essays httpaddr milton avery whose paintings are at the whitney museum december th is a sensitive colorist and designer of patterns in the tradition of matisse particularly infrequently reminding of braque and picasso without intensity it is doubtful however whether avery in terms content is saying enough with his color beyond revealing sophistication of his tastes in dealing with beauty on an while there is a certain mood in much of the work that might described as withdrawal loneliness or alienation the artist seems to have been able to summon the creative and aesthetic force concentration necessary to make of this wistful mood a profound on his condition or that of modern man thus avery seems essentially very skillful decorator in his use of color and pattern equivalent of robert exquisite sensibilities in both these there is a certain dignity in some of the figure particularly in the family groups or figures in interiors seated girl with dog studious sketcher for example most of faces and figures are in silhouette of course a area amidst other areas of color and one begins to ask how could can artists so long be satisfied with such simplistic solutions only to the human head but to the world as a whole the discoveries of major artists looking hauntingly over our shoulders the walls of museums are critical reminders of artistic intellectual richness and complexity apparently beyond the grasp of superficial easily satisfied great art has always striven for the essential whether it be form compositional construction or truth of content feeling meaning eliminating the in sense richly developed figures are as simple elemental as the less detailed figures of piero della the detailed physical accuracy and complexity of surface of rembrandt as simple and as a more broadly in our time the simplistic has mistakenly been substituted for simple for the essential less has been more for some time now attempted purity through elimination artists have abandoned world taking it away from the rest of us because of even fanaticism closely related to the puritanism a strongly reactionary position in opposition to excesses and horrors of the th century thou shalt not enjoy even recognize the existence of the world cry prophets mondrian to the present few artists who love the things of worldfew rembrandts or michelangelosare possible in such sterile avery go this far he gives us color and elegant expanse shape relating to nature but he denies us the telling detail humanizes the universal statement and strangely in doing so he both universality and the the simplistic evolving from the effective simplifications of gogh gauguin and others reflects a desire for the primitive basic solid dependable statement as alternative to complexity uncertainty and confusion in the process of living in increasingly difficult this is not to say that avery in a painting like mother and create an extremely effective note in the vermilion face shape of the baby in a picture otherwise composed relative neutrals and whites and in an unusual painting for artist seated blonde the large white figure in profile the foreground is drawn with much more sensitivity and to the knobby irregular contours of the human landscapes like his figures are generally decorations of the picture surface in terms of flat often shapes of attractive color but their basically decorative nature revealed if one thinks of an american painter with a similar desire directly stated pinkham art while having less color and a more complexly surface also has greater depth of emotional and expressiveness looking at ryder we feel in touch with the deepest elemental aspects of human creativity and the mystery of human destiny and the universe the depth of ryder as artist and human being allows us to sense the profound meaning in underlying our often in mundane matters of routine milton avery offers us little of this depth and significance closest he comes to creating symbols expressive of the forces of are works like the white wave with its spout of white silhouetting against a charcoal black sea and sky or sea a thin serrated line of white waves like shark diagonally across the top of the picture the sea and most of canvas black below but the images are lacking in elemental force aesthetic and life winslow studies of pounding sea and rock have more and expressive power as symbols of the struggle of life confrontation of opposites avery appears not to have the strength creativity personality or physical energy to bring off major while there certainly are exceptions late work into the early sixties he died in seems to lose intensity it had to slacken becoming more broadly simplistic fewer larger and less developed shapes suggesting the work of rothkosuch works as dunes and sea ii moon path tangerine and wine dark sea and a seagull painting or two however hills the sea with its dark green silhouettes of trees and even darker create a bold effective pattern against a narrow strip of sky large curving pink hill and light green sea sand and sky has a stark simplicity of two sand and sea and a clipped rectangle sky that approaches elementaland the minimalin composition sea moon and is interesting in its sprinkling of a moon and five essentially five point stars in a thinly roughly brushed sky and two layers of curving teardrop wave shapes against darker sea it is expressiveand iritatingbecause it is attractive and should be more profound in content and technique comparison with van more famous version of the night sky looking harmlessly is an effective statement of color design the artist stands facing the viewer sketching on the left of the canvas his bathroom complete with sink and mirror a blue vertical shape at right there is more devotion to the of facial features bright ears and the most telling in the picture an irregular line defining the jaw like a gash from ear to ear the painting is a wonderful harmony of whites and ochres with a subtle red generally as exhibited at the whitney a very strange personality indeed there is something manic about something dramatic belligerent even bizarre a kind of burlesque assertiveness an oddness of personality and execution seems most closely related to the of james in some of the he employs a kind of for flesh which seems the perfect color to express his strange personality as if he lived in a kind of land a where knights are commonplacesomewhere under stone down a hole through a hidden tunnel to where frogs newts salamanders dwellthe world of the what may be the strangest aspect of all is the contrast between explicitly stated eccentric frazzled personality and the placid body of his work were his paintings in general a vehicle assuage inner quirks and tensions a process not uncommon in if so did he go to such extremes to ease his own doubts peculiarities that he overcompensated creating an art that is lacking in creative power and specificity surely with the electric personality exhibited in his avery should been able to produce work of greater also the abstracted featureless figures in his other contrast oddly with his interest in the details of his own perhaps avery was unable to share his feelings with others only alone with his image in a mirror was he deprived as an artist of generative force of emotional connectedness with people and the in the creation of an art of strength and in the end one must take avery on his own terms or not take him all while his work is pleasing and attractive for the previously mentioned for this viewer it is too repetitive aims low is satisfied with too little and can hardly begin to fill the in the

http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Freeman_TheDescentofMan.html darwin about advanced the descent of descent vol descent vol darwin wrote in preface to the second edition of fiery ordeal through which book has he had avoided the logical outcome of the theory of evolution bringing man into the scheme for twelve and in fact it had by that time been so much accepted that clamour of the opposition was not strident he had also been in by place in nature the book in its edition contains two parts the descent of man itself and in relation to sex the word occurs for the first time any of works on page of the first volume of the edition that is to say before its appearance in the sixth edition the origin of species in the following year the last chapter is sexual selection in relation to man and it ends with the peroration about lowly origin the wording of which slightly in the first edition from that which is usually quoted in letter dated march emma darwin vol ii pp darwin mentions the help that his daughter henrietta emma had given in reading the manuscript and correcting the style and calls her very dear coadjutor and the first edition is in two volumes and occurs in two issues which not be distinguished by their title pages inserted advertisements bindings they have however important textual differences the issue can be recognized by the errata on the verso of the title leaf volume ii seventeen errata for volume i and eight for volume ii verso of the title leaf of volume ii of the second issue has a list nine other works by darwin and no errata the verso of the half leaf of volume ii of the first issue bears the note but is blank in the second the first issue has a note on a tipped in pp in volume ii which refers to serious and which affects pages in volume i and pages and in volume ii in the second issue this leaf is absent and the pages have been entirely reset the easiest way to distinguish the issues of volume i alone is to look at the first word on page is in the first issue and in the second issues have sixteen pages of inserted advertisements for popular works in volume i and sixteen pages of standard in volume ii all dated january the first issue of was published on february and the second of copies march both cost s and were in standard bindings the of the first issue are invariably in my experience dark green black whilst those of the second may be the same or dark the above descriptions refer to ordinary trade copies copy of volume i of the first issue now at cambridge differs in points and is in my experience unique firstly it is dated the title page secondly the wording on the title page differs from that of the trade edition and thirdly the spine gilding of case differs these points are summarized under no it is that wallace received his complimentary copy late in and complimentaries may have gone out at the same time so that copies like own may exist the presentation copy to boyd dawkins however is dated february in the first edition which is not printed from english stereos volume i is on the first issue text and volume ii on the second volume ii sixteen errata for volume i the compositor having p as being wrong and none for volume ii passage about the serious error is retained except for that part refers to pages and of volume ii i have seen a copy of i which is dated february so that it is probable that the volumes were not issued together there is a second american issue volume i which follows the text of the english there were two further issues of the two volume english edition april and in december of the seventh and eighth thousands changes were made in the texts of each and darwin remarks in preface to the second edition the successive reprints of first edition of this work i was able to introduce important the second edition of the tenth thousand is in one volume three parts instead of the two of the first sexual selection relation to man being separated off as the third part it extensively revised and contains a note on the brains of man and by t h huxley at pp and a five line errata slip this the subsequent four printings are octavos in twelves whilst that becomes an octavo in eights all are in standard bindings eleventh thousand of has the errata corrected as well as textual changes the twelfth thousand of has added at the end a supplemental note which is reprinted from nature of p this is the final definitive text and subsequent volume issues until the turn of the century are from stereos of in there was an entirely new printing in two volumes the edition uniform with the similar edition of the origin of printed in the same year this had two later issues and the stereos repaginated were then used for the one volume issues of edwardian period although not nearly so much in demand as the of species the work has appeared in a number of library especially in america and has been almost continuously in either in full or abridged it has also appeared in combination with the origin of species there is a brussels facsimile of seventh thousand in and a new york one of the second edition but no facsimile of the first issue of the first edition has appeared the limited editions club of new york issued a quarto in which like their origin of species was produced the griffin press adelaide unfortunately it omits the parts selection in relation to sex and is therefore useless as a it was translated into danish dutch french german italian russian and swedish in lifetime and into ten further since these include two in yiddish one from

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar this page wikipedia en copyright wikipedia from wikipedia the free jump to navigation not to be confused with calender or for other uses see calendar for the calendar for this year see common year starting on a page from the hindu calendar a calendar is a system of organizing days for social commercial or administrative purposes this is done by giving names periods of time typically days weeks months years a date is the designation of a single specific within such a system periods in a calendar such as years and are usually though not necessarily synchronized with the cycle of sun or the moon many civilizations and societies have a calendar usually derived from other calendars on which they their systems suited to their particular a calendar is also a physical device often this is the common usage of the word other similar types of calendars can computerized systems which can be set to remind the user of events and a calendar can also mean a list of planned events such as a the english word calendar is derived from the latin word which was the latin name of the first day of every calendar solar o days used by solar o calendar lunar lunisolar calendar other calendar arithmetic and astronomical complete and incomplete calendars in gregorian islamic hindu fiscal gregorian calendar with easter physical calendar calendars in see list of further external calendar a full calendar system has a different calendar date for every thus the week cycle is by itself not a full calendar neither is a system to name the days within a year without a for identifying the the simplest calendar system just counts time periods from a date this applies for the julian day or unix time the only possible variation is using a different reference date particular one less distant in the past to make the numbers computations in these systems are just a matter of addition other calendars have one or multiple larger units of calendars that contain one level of week and weekday this system without year the week number on increasing is not very year and ordinal date within the year eg the iso ordinal date calendars with two levels of year month and day most systems including gregorian calendar and its very similar predecessor julian calendar the islamic calendar and the year week and weekday eg the iso week cycles can be synchronized with periodic a lunar calendar is synchronized to the motion of the lunar phases an example is the islamic a solar calendar is based on perceived seasonal synchronized to the apparent motion of the sun an example is persian a calendar is based on a combination of both and lunar reckonings examples are the traditional calendar china the hindu calendar in india or the hebrew there are some calendars that appear to be synchronized to motion of venus such as some of the ancient calendars synchronization to venus appears to occur primarily civilizations near the the week cycle is an example of one that is not synchronized any external phenomenon although it may have been derived lunar phases beginning anew every very commonly a calendar includes more than one type of cycle or both cyclic and acyclic many calendars incorporate simpler calendars as elements for the rules of the hebrew calendar depend on the week cycle very simple calendar so the week is one of the cycles of the calendar it is also common to operate two calendars usually providing unrelated cycles and the result may also considered a more complex calendar for example the calendar has no inherent dependence on the week but western society the two are used together and calendar indicate both the gregorian date and the day of the week cycle is shared by various calendar systems although significance of special days such as friday saturday and systems of leap days usually do not affect the week cycle week cycle was not even interrupted when or dates skipped when the julian calendar was replaced by the gregorian by various solar main article solar days used by solar solar calendars assign a date to each solar day a day may of the period between sunrise and sunset with a period of night or it may be a period between successive such as two sunsets the length of the interval between two successive events may be allowed to vary slightly during the year it may be averaged into a mean solar day other types of may also use a solar calendar main article calendar there have been a number of proposals for reform of the calendar as the world calendar international fixed holocene calendar and recently the calendar the united nations considered adopting such a calendar for a while in the s but these proposals have lost of their lunar main article lunar not all calendars use the solar year as a unit a lunar calendar one in which days are numbered within each lunar phase because the length of the lunar month is not an even fraction of length of the tropical year a purely lunar calendar quickly against the seasons which vary much near the equator does however stay constant with respect to other phenomena tides an example is the islamic calendar marshack in a controversial reading believed that marks on bone baton c bc represented a lunar calendar other bones may also represent lunar calendars similarly rappenglueck believes that marks on a year old cave represent a lunar lunisolar a lunisolar calendar is a lunar calendar that compensates adding an extra month as needed to realign the months with the an example is the hebrew calendar which uses a year calendar nearly all calendar systems group consecutive days into and also into in a solar calendar a approximates tropical year that is the time it takes a complete cycle of seasons traditionally used to facilitate planning of agricultural activities in a lunar calendar month approximates the cycle of the moon phase consecutive days may grouped into other periods such as the because the number of days in the tropical year is not a whole a solar calendar must have a different number of days in years this may be handled for example by adding an extra day leap years the same applies to months in a lunar calendar also the number of months in a year in a lunisolar calendar this generally known as intercalation even if a calendar is solar not lunar the year cannot be divided entirely into months that vary in cultures may define other units of time such as the week for purpose of scheduling regular activities that do not easily with months or years many cultures use different baselines for starting years for example the year in japan is on the reign of the current emperor was year of emperor see decade century other calendar arithmetic and astronomical calendar of the qahal an astronomical calendar is based on ongoing observation examples the religious islamic calendar and the old religious jewish calendar the time of the second temple such a calendar is also referred as an calendar the advantage of such a calendar that it is perfectly and perpetually accurate the disadvantage is working out when a particular date would occur is an arithmetic calendar is one that is based on a strict set of an example is the current jewish calendar such a calendar is referred to as a calendar the advantage of such a is the ease of calculating when a particular date occurs disadvantage is imperfect accuracy furthermore even if the is very accurate its accuracy diminishes slowly over time owing changes in rotation this limits the lifetime of an arithmetic calendar to a few thousand years after then the would need to be modified from observations made since the invention the complete and incomplete calendars may be either complete or incomplete complete provide a way of naming each consecutive day while calendars do not the early roman calendar which had no way designating the days of the winter months other than to lump together as winter is an example of an incomplete calendar the gregorian calendar is an example of a complete the primary practical use of a calendar is to identify days to informed about to agree on a future event and to record an that has happened days may be significant for civil religious social reasons for example a calendar provides a way to which days are religious or civil holidays which days the beginning and end of business accounting periods and which have legal significance such as the day taxes are due or a expires also a calendar may by identifying a day provide useful information about the day such as its calendars are also used to help people manage their personal time and activities particularly when individuals have numerous school and family commitments people frequently use multiple and may keep both a business and family calendar to prevent them from overcommitting their calendars are also used as part of a complete timekeeping date and time of day together specify a moment in time in modern world written calendars are no longer an essential part of systems as the advent of accurate clocks has made it possible record time independently of astronomical calendars in gregorian calendars in widespread use today include the gregorian which is the de facto international standard and is used everywhere in the world for civil purposes due to the obvious connotations of western and even some christians sometimes replace traditional era notations ad and bc anno and before christ with ce and bce common era and common even where there is a commonly used calendar such as gregorian calendar alternative calendars may also be used such as fiscal calendar or the astronomical year islamic the islamic calendar muslim calendar or hijri is a lunar calendar consisting of lunar months in a year of days it is used to date events in most of the muslim concurrently with the gregorian calendar and used by everywhere to determine the proper day on which to celebrate holy days and festivals the first year was the year during which emigration of the prophet muhammad from mecca to medina known as hijra occurred each numbered year is designated either h for hijra ah for the latin anno hegirae in the year of the being purely lunar calendar it is not synchronized with the seasons with annual drift of or days the seasonal relation is approximately each islamic hindu the lunisolar hindu calendars are some of the most calendars of the world the names of the twelve months are the same all parts of india because they are named in sanskrit though spelling and pronunciation vary slightly and the first month of year varies from one region to another depending upon past the standardized indian national calendar based on saka with ce as the start of the calendar is a lunar hindu calendar by the government together with gregorian calendar however it is used by the general public which widely uses the vikrami lunar vikram samvat with bce as the start of the calendar religious activities and festivals vikram samvat is also the calendar in nepal a lunar month may have or days all calendars have about days and they insert an additional th by repeating a month twice in that year every few years synchronize

duck canyon the canyon kiddies are a group of kids in the looney tunes and melodies series of theatrical shorts they appeared in very few the first being the mighty hunters the canyon kiddies became very popular characters but did appear in the film cecil cecil turtle is an animated cartoon character the warner bros looney tunes and merrie melodies series of though he made only three theatrical appearances cecil is in that he is one of the very few characters who was able to bugs bunny and the only one to do so three times in a row and the own animator tex avery introduced cecil in the tortoise beats hare released on march even from opening titles avery lets on that bugs bunny is about meet his match bugs wanders onto the screen munching his carrot and begins reading the title card mispronouncing most of the credits such as for rather than the correct when he finally gets to title itself he becomes outraged tears apart the title card rushes to cecil house he then bets the little turtle ten dollars equal to today that he can beat in a race cecil accepts bet and the race begins days later bugs races away at top speed just before finishing shout of get on your mark get set go cecil quickly for anyway goes to a public telephone and calls up chester turtle talking to chester about the bet he tells him to call the cousins and tell them to be ready when he comes to their and to give him the chester calls the relatives all of look and sound like cecil some have deeper voices some have voices and relays the message as bugs runs relentlessly toward finish line cecil and the other turtles take turns showing up at the right moment to baffle the bunny in the end bugs is convinced has won only to see cecil or one of his kin across the demanding the money bugs suggests that he has been tricked and nine turtles approach and reply a possibility voice mel blanc supplies drowsy drawl which is like version of later characterization of tortoise beats hare follows one of the many folk variants of aesop fable the tortoise and the hare in which faster beast is deceived by placed along course more directly it is parody of the disney silly symphony the tortoise and the hare left warner bros before he could produce any new cartoons cecil however he introduced a similar character in droopy droopy would even take some of his tricks from predecessor such as using his relatives to help outsmart a bob clampett took scenario and altered it for his tortoise wins by a hare released on february the is an appropriate pun on bugs again challenges cecil to a after viewing footage from their previous encounter two years which seems to depict cecil as having won fairly instead of cheating bugs with his bugs then goes to tree disguised as an old man a parody of bill old character from fibber mcgee and molly to ask the turtle secret cecil not in the least bit fooled by the disguise clean friend clean and then reveals streamlined shell lets him win and produces a set of for his the turtle ends the conversation the comment oh and another thing rabbits very either just before slamming the door in the enraged face getting the hint that the story is a humbug bugs the device and prepares for the race meanwhile the bunny learns of the upcoming and places all its bets on bugs fact we even think that the toitle will finish do we duh no boss no the race begins and bugs still outpaces reptilian rival however in his new the mistake him for the turtle cecil reinforces this misconception dressing in a gray rabbit suit and munching on some carrots the mobsters thus make the shelled run nightmare ultimately giving the race to cecil in an aside to audience as the rabbits cheer him cecil remarks i told you very when bugs removes the chassis and reveals that the rabbit the rabbit gangsters remark in style ehhh now he tells us upon realizing their mistake and suicide by shooting themselves with a single bullet that through the sides of all of their apparently soft heads the final is often cut when shown on basic cable television but can be uncut on the looney tunes golden collection volume cecil and bugs would have one final match up in friz cartoon rabbit transit released on may the title is play of rapid transit unlike tortoise wins by a hare cartoon presumes that bugs and cecil have never met before now relaxing in a steam bath bugs reads about the original fable and he did reading the credits of tortoise beats hare becomes incensed the idea of a turtle outrunning a rabbit cecil also in the bath claims that he could outrun bugs prompting bugs to challenge to a race again as in tortoise beats hare although at least bugs receives some this time bugs and cecil agree to cheating cecil however quickly reveals that his shell is rocket propelled allowing him to go a surprising between fast and slow bugs does his best to steal dismantle destroy the device but all to little effect in the end however does manage to top the turtle and crosses the finish line nevertheless it is cecil who has the last laugh when he rooks rabbit into confessing to doing a zone bugs is taken away by two police officers to enjoy victory behind bars cecil closes out the cartoon by saying famous line i aumstinker the warners directors retired cecil after his third showdown with nevertheless cecil made occasional cameos in later projects only notable looney tunes short cameo came in devil hare which was directed by robert mckimson sr and pitted against the tasmanian devil who made his debut cecil later made a cameo in an episode of the sylvester and mysteries as well as a brief appearance in the film jam he also appeared in the dvd looney tunes check his voice now provided by joe alaskey in addition appears some issues of the looney tunes comic more recently cecil appeared in the looney tunes show customer service voiced by jim rash he is seen as customer service representative at the company he ends up taking off the cable service from bugs bunny ends up angering him more when he demands that the cable restores his cable this leads to bugs bunny to quote of course realize this means war when cecil goes out to work daffy tells to be back by or be fired cecil finds bugs bunny as a female worker at coffee hut and bugs ends up doing comeuppance cecil as he tries to get back to work bugs even disguises himself an elevator operator to delay cecil when cecil makes it to his bugs bunny disguises himself in a full costume disguised as a being and tells him that he must restore bugs cable after ruse is done and daffy duck fires him bugs bunny thanks cecil for restoring cable service to him this is the first time that bugs able to win against charlie charlie dog charlie the dog or charles the dog is animated cartoon fictional character in the warner looney tunes series of cartoons bob clampett minted the that charlie dog would later inherit in his cartoon short pooch first released on december a homeless hound pulls all the stops to get adopted by bachelor porky pig mel would provide the gruff and accent which became standard however as he did for so many other looney tunes chuck jones took hound and transformed him something new jones first used the dog in little orphan october which saw rover renamed charlie film was a success and jones would create two more charlie pig cartoons in awful orphan january and often orphan jones also starred charlie without porky in couple of shorts dog gone south august which yankee charlie searching for a fine gentleman of the united states and a hound for trouble april which charlie to italy where he searches for a master who in these cartoons charlie dog is defined by one desire to himself a master to this end charlie is willing to pull out all stops from pulling the big soulful eyes routine to boasting of pedigree fifty percent collie fifty percent setter setter fifty percent boxer fifty percent doberman fifty percent it is there it is there it is mostly all labrador retriever when reminded by others he is not a labrador retriever his response would be if me a labrador retrieve it for you in reality he just a mutt who rarely realizes that his aggressive obnoxiousness is sabotaging his appeal to any charlie makes a brief cameo appearance via animation often an orphan in the robert short tales jones shelved the charlie dog series of films in s along with other characters he had introduced such as three bears and hubie and bertie he was turning his efforts new characters such as le pew and wile e coyote the road runner however recent warner bros merchandising and and films such as episodes of tiny toon adventures the space jam in the crowd scenes here performed by welker and adventure in italy brought charlie back out of the frisky puppy character that jones paired with claude in several shorts bears a close physical resemblance to charlie dog made a cameo appearance in the looney tunes episode father he is seen at a pet store where he attacked by henery hawk who was looking for a charles m charles m wolf or as his wife calls him charlie is a wolf who appeared in red riding hoodwinked wolf his name is only given in the second feature and apparently animator chuck jones whose real name was charles jones in his first appearance his design resembled a modified of sylvester but in his later appearance his design was simplified to make it look claude claude cat a pun on the homophone clawed cat had his in several other cat characters used by chuck jones from to these cats were mostly similar in appearance and temperament black fur and anxious personalities for example in the the the first speaking role jones his unnamed cat against the mouse hubie and jones redesigned the neurotic feline for the film wreckers perhaps to distinguish him from friz puss the short is another hubie and bertie only this time the antagonist they antagonize is claude drawn as would appear in all future cartoons yellow with a red shock of

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraken this page wikipedia en copyright wikipedia from wikipedia the free jump to navigation for other uses see kraken caption colossal octopus by pierre denys de the colossal octopus pen and wash drawing by pierre de montfort from the descriptions of sailors reportedly attacked by such a creature off the coast mythology grouping legendary sea country habitat greenland kraken pron are sea monsters of giant proportions said to dwell off the coasts norway and the legend may actually have originated from sightings of giant squid that are variously estimated to grow to ft in length including the tentacles creatures normally live at great depths but have been sighted at surface and have reportedly attacked the sheer size and fearsome appearance attributed to the kraken made it a common monster in various fictional appearance and see external the th century old icelandic saga saga of two massive called hafgufa sea mist lyngbakr the hafgufa is believed to be reference to the now i will tell you that there are two one is the hafgufa another lyngbakr whales the biggest of everything in the world but the hafgufa is greatest monster occurring in the water it is its nature that swallows both men and ships and whales and everything that it reach it is submerged both by day and night together and when strikes up its head and nose above the surface then it stays least until the turn of the tide now that sound we sailed we sailed between its jaws and its nose and lower jaw were rocks that appeared to you in the ocean while the lyngbakr was island we saw sinking down however ogmundur floki has sent creatures to you by means of his secret arts for to cause the of you and all your men he thought that more men should have the same way as those that had already drowned and he expected the hafgufa would have swallowed us all today i sailed through mouth because i knew that it had recently after returning from greenland the anonymous author of the norwegian scientific work konungs circa described in detail the physical characteristics and behavior of these beasts the narrator proposed there must only be in existence stemming from the observation that the beasts have been sighted in the same parts of the greenland sea and that seemed incapable of reproduction as there was no increase in there is a fish that is still unmentioned which it is advisable to speak about on account of its size because it seem to most people incredible there are only a very few who speak upon it clearly because it is seldom near land nor where it may be seen by fishermen and i suppose there are not of this sort of fish in the sea most often in our tongue we call hafgufa nor can i conclusively speak about its length in because the times he has shown before men he has appeared more land than like a fish neither have i heard that one had been or found dead and it seems to me as though there must be no than two in the oceans and i deem that each is unable to itself for i believe that they are always the same ones then neither would it do for other fish if the hafgufa were of such number as other whales on account of their vastness and how subsistence that they need it is said to be the nature of fish that when one shall desire to eat then it stretches up neck with a great belching and following this belching comes much food so that all kinds of fish that are near to hand will to present location then will gather together both small large believing they shall obtain there food and good eating this great fish lets its mouth stand open the while and the gap no less wide than that of a great sound or fjord and nor may fish avoid running together there in their great numbers but soon as its stomach and mouth is full then it locks together jaws and has the fish all caught and enclosed that before came there looking for carolus linnaeus classified the kraken as a designating the scientific name microcosmus marinus in the edition of his systema naturae a taxonomic of living organisms the creature was excluded from editions later work fauna calls the creature singulare monstrum a unique monster says of it habitare fertur in

historie natural history of norway pontoppidan made several claims kraken including the notion that the creature was sometimes for an island and that the real danger to sailors was not creature itself but rather the whirlpool left in its however pontoppidan also described the destructive potential of giant beast it is said that if the arms were to lay of the largest they would pull it down to according to pontoppidan fishermen often took the risk of trying to fish over kraken since catch was so plentiful hence the saying you must have on pontoppidan also proposed that a specimen of monster perhaps a young and careless one was washed ashore and at alstahaug in by description of the kraken had been translated into swedish author jacob wallenberg described the kraken in the min son galejan my son on the kraken also called the which is not that huge heads and tails counted he is no larger than our is ie less than km he stays at the sea floor surrounded by innumerable small fishes who serve as his food are fed by him in return for his meal if i remember what e pontoppidan writes lasts no longer than three months another three are then needed to digest it his excrements in the following an army of lesser fish and for this fishermen plumb after his resting place gradually ascends to the surface and when he is at ten to twelve the boats had better move out of his vicinity as he will thereafter burst up like a floating island spurting water from dreadful nostrils and making ring waves around him which can many miles could one doubt that this is the leviathan pierre de poulpe colossal attacks a ship in the french malacologist pierre de recognized the existence of two kinds of giant octopus in naturelle et des mollusques an description of mollusks montfort claimed that the first type kraken octopus had been described by norwegian sailors and whalers as well as ancient writers such as pliny the elder much larger second type the colossal octopus was reported have attacked a sailing vessel from off the coast montfort later dared more sensational claims he proposed that british warships including the captured french ship of the ville de paris which had mysteriously disappeared one night must have been attacked and sunk by giant octopuses the however of a survivor from the ville de ships had been lost in a hurricane off the coast of in september resulting in a disgraceful revelation appearance and since the late th century kraken have been depicted in a number ways primarily as large creatures and it has been alleged that kraken might have been based observations of the giant squid in the descriptions however the creatures were more than and generally possessed traits that associated with large whales rather than with giant squid traits

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telepathy this page wikipedia en copyright wikipedia from wikipedia the free jump to navigation for other uses see telepathy this article is about the paranormal phenomenon for the act see caption an experiment in sensory deprivation aiming to demonstrate coined by frederic w h myers definition the transference of thoughts or feelings between two or subjects through signature one subject said to gain information from another that shielded from their traditional senses by distance time or see also anomalous ganzfeld telepathy from the ancient greek tyle tele meaning distant pathe or patheia meaning feeling perception affliction experience is the transmission information from one person to another without using any of our sensory channels or physical interaction the term was coined in by the classical scholar frederic w h myers a founder the society for psychical research and has remained popular than the earlier scientific consensus does not view telepathy as a real phenomenon studies seeking to detect understand and utilize telepathy have done but according to the prevailing view among scientists lacks replicable results from telepathy is a common theme in modern fiction and science fiction many superheroes and supervillains having telepathic origins of the case in skepticism and in popular see external origins of the according to roger luckhurst the origin of the concept telepathy not telepathy itself in the western civilization can tracked to the late th century in his view science did frequently concern itself with the mind prior to this as physical sciences made significant advances scientific concepts applied to mental phenomena eg animal magnetism with the that this would help understand paranormal phenomena the concept of telepathy emerged in this historical the notion of telepathy is not dissimilar to two concepts delusions of thought psychological symbiosis this similarity might explain how people have come up with the idea of telepathy is a symptom of psychosis particularly schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder psychiatric who experience this symptom falsely believe that some of their are not their own and that others eg other people aliens or fallen angels or conspiring intelligence agencies are thoughts into their minds thought some patients feel as thoughts are being taken out of their minds or deleted along with other symptoms of psychosis delusions of insertion may be reduced by antipsychotic psychological symbiosis on the other hand is a less well concept it is an idea found in the writings of early such as melanie klein it entails the belief that in the psychological experience of the child during earliest infancy child is unable to tell the difference between his or her own mind one hand and his or her experience of the on the hand this state of mind is called psychological symbiosis development it ends but purportedly aspects of it can still detected in the psychological functioning of the adult putatively experience of either thought or unconscious of psychological symbiosis may have led to the invention of as a notion and the belief that telepathy exists psychiatrists clinical psychologists believe and empirical findings support the that people with schizotypal personality disorder are likely to believe in case a famous experiment in telepathy was recorded by the american upton sinclair in his book mental radio which test of psychic abilities of mary craig kimbrough second wife she attempted to duplicate pictures which were by her husband sinclair claimed mary successfully duplicated them with partial successes and failures however experiments were not conducted in a controlled scientific another example is the experiments carried out by the author sherman with the explorer hubert wilkins who carried out their experiments in telepathy for five and a half months starting in this took place when sherman was in new york and wilkins in the arctic the experiment consisted of sherman and wilkins the end of each day to relax and visualise a mental image or impression of the events or thoughts they had experienced in the and then to record those images and thoughts on paper in a diary results at the end when comparing diary to wilkins was per cent were found to be a typical example on february on that day both sherman and wilkins had that cold weather had delayed their jobs they both had witnessed skin had peeled off their finger they both recorded they had drunk alcohol with friends and witnessed boxes of cigars brought and both recorded that they had experienced to rule out any kind of fraud each night sherman had sent impressions to gardner murphy a psychologist at university murphy had studied the results and that some could be explained by coincidence but that exceptions were unexplainable one such example took place armistice day wilkins had attended a formal ball for army with the locals in canada as his plane was forced to land due bad weather wilkins recorded that he was worried about a that he had to wear as the waistcoat was short in size on same night sherman recorded in his diary you in company with men military people appear to be in evening dress wilkins was very impressed by the results and wrote when we finally were able to compare notes what did we find amazing number of impressions recorded by sherman of happenings and personal experiences reactions and thoughts of too many of them were approximately correct and synchronized with very day of the occurences to have been the full results of the experiments were published in in a book sherman and wilkins titled thoughts through space in the book sherman and wilkins had written that they believed they demonstrated that it was possible to send and receive impressions from the mind of one person to in main articles parapsychology and ganzfeld within the field of parapsychology telepathy is considered to be form of perception esp or anomalous in which information is transferred through psi it is categorized similarly to precognition clairvoyance various experiments have been used to for telepathic abilities among the most well known are the use zener cards and the ganzfeld zener zener cards are cards marked with five distinctive symbols when them one individual is designated the sender and another the sender must select a random card and visualize symbol on it while the receiver must attempt to determine that using psi statistically the receiver has a chance of guessing the correct symbol so in order to demonstrate telepathy must repeatedly score a success rate that is significantly higher if not conducted properly this method can be to sensory leakage and card when using the ganzfeld experiment to test for telepathy individual is designated the receiver and is placed inside a environment where they are deprived of sensory input and is designated the sender and is placed in a separate location receiver is then required to receive information from the sender exact nature of the information may vary between a physical model of telepathy whether described as radiational or other terms assumes that transference is effected by means of vibratory current linking one brain to another crookes proposed a brain wave theory in which he claimed might occur due to high frequency vibrations of the ether had stated that there may be parts of the human brain that may capable of sending and receiving electrical rays wavelengths william fletcher barrett and william henry myers however pointed out problems in a physical for telepathy and instead advocated psychical in the early th century there were two other prominent concepts telepathy the spiritualist position which claimed telepathy the result of external spirits and a view claiming between two or more subconscious minds the mind view was advocated by psychical researcher thomson jay who wrote that the mind is a duality and actually consists of minds the objective mind conscious and the subjective the psychical researcher john arthur hill wrote regarding telepathy physical theory of telepathy has been worked out there are known and no receiving stations yet discovered our skulls george n m tyrrell also claimed that physical basis for telepathy was untenable as ideas can not transmitted from one mind to another by any physical means being first translated into a code h h price suggested that telepathy was incompatible with any explanation as a physical theory of telepathy would reveal detectable on physical instruments but none have ever some parapsychologists still proposed that telepathy may have physical explanation the italian neurologist ferdinando in the s had claimed that telepathic communication occurred due a type of electromagnetic radiation however neurophysiologist william grey walter in his book the living wrote that electrical are too weak to telepathy hans berger also held this view but extended the by proposing that telepathy occurs when electrical energy in brain is transformed into which can diffused to any distance passing through obstacles in michael persinger proposed that extremely elf electromagnetic waves may be able to carry and clairvoyant information johnjoe mcfadden written the em field outside the head is far too weak and it is unlikley that any other brain could detect it and still more that the other brain could decode the em field information that encoded by your gerald feinberg suggested that telepathy may exist due to as undiscovered elementary particles which he called in recent years the parapsychologist charles tart has accepted existence of telepathy but claims that it is nonphysical in nature can not be fitted into any physical parapsychology describes several different forms of including latent telepathy and precognitive latent telepathy formerly known as deferred telepathy described as being the transfer of information through psi with observable between transmission and retrocognitive precognitive and intuitive telepathy is described being the transfer of information through psi about the past or present state of an mind to emotive telepathy also known as remote influence emotional transfer is the process of transferring sensations through altered superconscious telepathy involves tapping into the to access the collective wisdom of the human species skepticism and in the physicists john taylor and eduardo balanovski that the only scientifically feasible explanation for telepathy be electromagnetism em involving em fields in a series experiments the em levels were many orders of magnitude lower calculated and no paranormal effects were observed both taylor balanovski wrote their results were a strong argument against validity of the although not a recognized scientific discipline people who certain types of paranormal phenomena such as telepathy refer the field as parapsychology parapsychologists claim that instances of telepathy are real skeptics say instances of apparent telepathy are explained as the result of and that telepathy does exist as a paranormal parapsychologists and skeptics agree that virtually all of instances of more popular psychic phenomena such as can be attributed to techniques such as reading magicians such as rowland and derren brown have demonstrated techniques and similar to those of popular psychics without paranormal means have identified described and developed psychological techniques cold reading and hot a technique which shows statistically significant evidence of on every occasion has yet to be discovered this lack of reproducibility has led skeptics to argue that there is no scientific evidence for the existence of telepathy at skeptics also point to historical cases in which flaws in design and occasional cases of fraud were research in anomalistic psychology has discovered that in cases telepathy can be explained by a covariation bias in experiment schienle et al believers and skeptics asked to judge the covariation between transmitted symbols and corresponding feedback given by a receiver according to the the believers overestimated the number of successful whilst the skeptics made accurate hit judgments the from another telepathy experiment involving undergraduate students rudski were explained by hindsight confirmation in popular telepathy is commonly used in fiction with a number superheroes and supervillains as well as figures in science fiction novels etc use telepathy notable telepaths include the jedi in star wars the mechanics telepathy in fiction vary widely some fictional telepaths are to receiving only thoughts that are deliberately sent by telepaths or even to receiving thoughts from a specific other for example in robert a novel time for stars certain pairs of twins are able to send telepathic messages each other in a e van science fiction novel the mutant hero jommy cross can read the minds of ordinary humans telepaths can read the thoughts only of those they touch such vulcans in the star trek media franchise star trek consultant and writer bormanis has revealed that within the star trek universe works via the psionic field to bormanis a psionic field is the medium through which thoughts and feelings are communicated through space humanoids can tap into this field through a kind of sense located in the brain in the same manner that human eyes can portions of the electromagnetic field telepaths can portions of the psionic field in the book eragon eragon communicate through his mind with almost anyone including his saphira but it is possible to block people from mind with barrier in the harry potter series by j k telepathy is a magical skill known as legilimency in john wyndham novel the chrysalids the main character narrator david strorm is one of a group of nine telepaths anthony power of five series twins jamie scott tyler were born with telepathic powers that enable them to minds and ultimately control them they always know thoughts which earns them money doing tricks at a circus reno nevada some writers view telepathy as the evolutionary destiny of humanity tony novel just a couple of days telepathy across the entire human species as a result of the pied piper which inadvertently eliminates symbolic capacity in instance telepathy is seen as a latent ability that emerges only the distractions of language are some fictional telepaths possess mind control abilities which include pushing thoughts feelings or hallucinatory visions into mind of another person causing pain paralysis or altering or erasing memories or completely taking over mind and body similar to spiritual of this type of telepath include professor xavier jean grey emma frost and numerous other characters in marvel universe along with matt parkman from the series the radio crimefighter the shadow had the power to cloud minds which he used to mask his presence from the film scanners concerns around people born with this kind telepathy as well as those with telekinetic the urdu novel devta is based on the character of farhad taimur

classification and external a case of tuberous sclerosis showing facial angiofibromas characteristic butterfly icd icd omim diseasesdb medlineplus emedicine mesh tuberous sclerosis or tuberous sclerosis complex tsc is a genetic disease that causes tumors grow in the brain and on other vital organs such as kidneys heart eyes lungs and skin combination of symptoms may include seizures delay behavioral problems skin abnormalities lung and disease tsc is caused by a mutation of either of two tsc and tsc which code for the proteins hamartin tuberin respectively these proteins act as tumor suppressors agents that regulate cell proliferation the name composed of the latin tuber swelling and the greek hard refers to the pathological finding of thick firm and gyri called tubers in the brains of patients these tubers were first described by bourneville the cortical manifestations may sometimes still be known by eponym signs and central nervous external signs and see also list of dental abnormalities associated with the physical manifestations of tuberous sclerosis are due to formation of hamartia malformed tissue such as the benign growths such as facial angiofibroma subependymal nodules and very rarely cancerous the effect of these on the brain leads to neurological symptoms such seizures mental retardation developmental delay and problems symptoms also include trouble in school and central nervous tuberous sclerosis in about of people with tsc have learning difficulties from mild to significant and studies have reported between and of affected individuals meet the criteria for autism with an even higher proportion features of a broader pervasive developmental disorder study reported behavior in of people tsc other conditions such as adhd aggression outbursts and ocd can also occur lower iq is associated with brain involvement on three types of brain tumours may be associated with giant cell astrocytoma grows and blocks the csf flow leading dilatation of ventricles causing headache and cortical tubers after which the disease is nodules form in the walls of classic intracranial manifestations of tuberous sclerosis nodules and the tubers are typically triangular in configuration with the pointed towards the ventricles and are thought to represent foci abnormal neuronal migration the t signal abnormalities may subside adulthood but will still be visible on histopathological analysis magnetic resonance imaging tsc patients can exhibit other consistent with abnormal neuron migration radial white matter hyperintense on heterotopic gray subependymal nodules are composed of abnormal swollen glial cells bizarre multinucleated cells which are indeterminate for glial neuronal origin there is no interposed neural tissue these have a tendency to calcify as the patient ages a nodule that enhances and enlarges over time should be considered suspicious transformation into a subependymal giant cell astrocytoma sega typically develops in the region of the foramen of monro which case it is at risk of developing an a variable degree of ventricular enlargement either obstructive by a subependymal nodule in the region of the foramen of monro idiopathic in computed tomography showing multiple angiomyolipomas of the kidney in patient with lung lymphangioleiomyomatosis on ct suspected between and of tsc patients have benign tumors once

larger cm is at risk for a potentially catastrophic hemorrhage spontaneously or with minimal trauma amls are found in about in people without tsc however those are usually solitary whereas in they are commonly multiple and approximately of people with tsc will have renal cysts few problems however may also have autosomal polycystic kidney very rare problems include renal cell carcinoma oncocytomas benign adenomatous patients with tsc can develop progressive replacement of the parenchyma with multiple cysts this process is identical to disease called lymphangioleiomyomatosis recent analysis has shown that the proliferative bronchiolar smooth muscle tuberous lam is monoclonal metastasis from coexisting renal angiomyolipoma there have been cases of lam recurring following lung rhabdomyomas are benign tumors of striated muscle a rhabdomyoma can be discovered using echocardiography approximately of people with tsc however the incidence in newborn may be as high as and in adults as low as these grow during the second half of pregnancy and regress after birth will disappear entirely alternatively the tumor size remains as the heart grows which has much the same problems due to rhabdomyomas include obstruction arrhythmia and murmur such complications occur almost exclusively pregnancy or within the first prenatal ultrasound performed by an obstetric specializing in cardiology can detect a rhabdomyoma after this rare tumour is a strong indicator of tsc in the child if there is a family history of some form of dermatological sign will be present in of with tsc most cause no problems but are helpful in diagnosis cases may cause disfigurement necessitating treatment the most skin abnormalities facial angiofibromas adenoma sebaceum a rash of reddish or bumps which appear on the nose and cheeks in a distribution they consist of blood vessels and fibrous this socially embarrassing rash starts to appear during and can be removed using dermabrasion or laser periungual fibromas also known as tumors these small fleshy tumors that grow around and under the toenails fingernails and may need to be surgically removed if they or cause bleeding these are very rare in childhood but common middle age they are generally more common on toes than on develop at years and are more common in women than in they can be induced by hypomelanic macules ash leaf spots white or patches of skin that may appear anywhere on the body and are by a lack of melanin these are usually the only visible of tsc at birth in individuals a ultraviolet light may be required to see forehead plaques raised discolored areas on the shagreen patches areas of thick leathery skin that are like an orange and usually found on the lower or nape of the neck they can also be scattered across the trunk thighs the frequency of these lesions rises with other skin features are not unique to individuals with including molluscum fibrosum or skin tags which typically across the back of the neck and shoulders au lait or flat brown marks and poliosis a tuft or patch of white hair the scalp or retinal lesions called astrocytic hamartomas or phakomas appear as a greyish or lesion in the back of the on the ophthalmic examination astrocytic hamartomas can calcify they are in the differential diagnosis of a calcified globe mass on ct lesions associated with tsc angiofibromas of the papilledema related to individuals with tuberous sclerosis may experience none or all of clinical signs discussed above the following table shows prevalence of some of the clinical signs in individuals diagnosed tuberous the frequency of clinical signs in children with tuberous grouped by tuberous sclerosis is inherited in an autosomal dominant tuberous sclerosis is a genetic disorder with an dominant pattern of inheritance and penetrance variable two thirds of tsc cases result from sporadic mutations not inheritance but their offspring may inherit it them current genetic tests have difficulty locating the mutation approximately of individuals diagnosed with the disease so far has been mapped to two genetic loci tsc and tsc encodes for the protein hamartin is located chromosome q and was discovered in tsc for the protein tuberin is located on chromosome and was discovered in tsc is contiguous with pkd gene involved in one form of polycystic kidney disease gross deletions affecting both genes may account for the individuals with tsc who also develop pkd in childhood has been associated with a more severe form of tsc the difference is subtle and cannot be used to identify the clinically estimates of the proportion of tsc caused by tsc from to tsc and tsc are both tumor suppressor genes that according to two hit hypothesis that is a random mutation must occur before a tumor can develop this why despite its percent penetrance tsc has symbol entrez hugo omim refseq uniprot other locus chr symbol entrez hugo omim refseq uniprot other locus chr icon this section requires expansion may hamartin and tuberin function as a complex which is involved in control of cell growth and cell division the complex appears interact with rheb gtpase thus sequestering it activating mtor signalling part of the growth insulin signalling pathway thus mutations at the tsc tsc loci result in a loss of control of cell growth and cell and therefore a predisposition to forming tumors tsc affects from different germ layers cutaneous and visceral lesions may including adenoma sebaceum cardiac rhabdomyomas and angiomyolipomas the central nervous system cns lesions seen in disorder include hamartomas of the cortex hamartomas of ventricular walls and subependymal giant cell tumors which develop in the vicinity of the foramina of molecular genetic studies have defined at least two loci for tsc tsc the abnormality is localized on chromosome q but the of the gene protein called hamartin remains unclear no mutations occur in in tsc the gene abnormalities are chromosome this gene encodes tuberin a protein the specific function of protein is unknown in tsc all types of mutations have been new mutations occur frequently few differences have yet been in the clinical phenotypes of patients with mutation of one gene or there are no pathognomonic clinical signs for sclerosis many signs are present in individuals who are although rarely or who have another

against the diagnostic criteria produce a level of diagnostic definite either two major features or one major feature plus minor probable one major plus one minor suspect either one major feature or two or more minor due to the wide variety of mutations leading to tsc there are simple genetic tests available to identify new cases nor there any biochemical markers for the gene however once a person has been clinically diagnosed the mutation can usually be found the search is and has failure rate which is thought to be due to mosaicism if successful this information can be used to affected family members including prenatal diagnosis as update preimplantation diagnosis is not drug therapy for some of the manifestations of tsc is currently in developmental stage for example a study found treatment with rapamycin rescued learning and memory deficits in mouse model of tuberous sclerosis community tsc is distributed computing project to find drugs to needed the patients usually have relapse symptoms in the clinical course unless any vital function is life expectancy is good majority of patients will require medications to control symptoms eg to seizures in everolimus was approved for the treatment subependymal giant cell other drugs used the prognosis for individuals with tsc depends on the severity symptoms which range from mild skin abnormalities to varying of learning disabilities and epilepsy to severe mental uncontrollable seizures and kidney failure those individuals mild symptoms generally do well and live long productive lives individuals with the more severe form may have serious however with appropriate medical care most individuals with disorder can look forward to normal life a study of tsc patients in egypt found that earlier age seizures commencement months is associated with poor outcome and poor intellectual capabilities infantile spasms severely epileptogenic eeg patterns are related to the poor outcome poor intellectual capabilities and autistic behavior tubers numbers is associated with poor seizure outcome and behavior left sided tuber burden is associated with poor while frontal location is more encountered in asd so close follow for the mental development and early control of seizures recommended in a trial to reduce the risk factors of poor outcome early diagnosis of autism will allow for earlier treatment and potential for better outcome for children with leading causes of death include renal disease brain lymphangiomyomatosis of the lung and status epilepticus bronchopneumonia in those with severe mental cardiac failure due to rhabdomyomas is a risk in the fetus or but is rarely a problem subsequently kidney complications such angiomyolipoma aml and cysts are common and more frequent in than males and in tsc than renal cell carcinoma is lymphangioleiomyomatosis lam is only a risk for females amls in the brain the subependymal nodules degenerate to subependymal giant cell astrocytomas these block the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid around the brain to detection of the disease should prompt one for genetic counselling is also important to know that even though the disease does not have cure symptoms can be treated symptomatically hence regarding different organ manifestations of tuberous sclerosis tuberous sclerosis occurs in all races and ethnic groups and in genders the prevalence is estimated to be and cases per a study estimated total prevalence between about and cases per with more half of these cases undetected these estimates significantly higher than those produced by older studies tuberous sclerosis was regarded as an extremely rare disease reason is that the invention of ct and ultrasound have enabled the diagnosis of many cases prior this the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis was largely restricted severely affected individuals with triad of learning seizures and facial angiofibroma the total population figures have steadily increased from in to to in to in to the present of in whilst still regarded as a rare disease is common when compared to many other genetic main article timeline of tuberous tuberous sclerosis first came to medical attention when described the distinctive facial rash and a more case was presented by von recklinghausen who heart and brain tumours in a newborn that had only briefly however bourneville is credited with having characterized the disease coining the name tuberous sclerosis earning the eponym disease the vogt established a diagnostic triad of epilepsy and adenoma sebaceum an obsolete term for symptoms were periodically added to the clinical picture the as presently understood was first fully described by gomez the invention of medical ultrasound ct and mri allowed physicians to examine the internal organs of live patients greatly improved diagnostic two genetic loci associated with tuberous sclerosis tsc tsc were discovered in and respectively this enabled the use of genetic testing as a diagnostic tool proteins associated with tsc and tsc harmartin and tuberin as a complex in the mtor signalling pathway that controls growth and cell division the importance of this pathway in therapy

basketball team based in salt city utah they are a part of the northwest division in western conference in the national basketball the franchise began in as the new orleans jazz in orleans louisiana the team moved to utah in the jazz were one of the most successful teams in the league in early years although they took years before they made a appearance in they would not miss the playoffs again during the late s john stockton and karl arose as the franchise players for the team and formed one of the famed point forward duos in nba history led coach jerry sloan who took over for frank layden in became one of the powerhouse teams of the s culminating in two finals appearances in and where they lost both to the chicago bulls led by michael jordan both stockton malone moved on in after missing the playoffs for consecutive seasons the jazz returned to prominence under the leadership of point guard deron williams however partway the season the jazz began a restructuring after the of jerry sloan and trade of deron williams the team has made playoffs since then under coach tyrone corbin the jazz are only team in the major professional north american sports located in the state of utah however utah is home to real lake a team in major league franchise early years in new moving to the frank layden stockton and o arrival of jerry o working towards o final years of stockton and the deron williams o busy present the tyrone corbin season arenas and current international retired basketball hall of franchise individual franchise head official fan external franchise early years in new in the jazz franchise began in new orleans as the team to enter the nba the first major move was to trade star player pete maravich who had played collegiately at from the atlanta hawks for two draft picks picks and one pick over the next years although he was considered one of the most players in the league and won the scoring championship in points per game the best record while in new orleans in the season maravich struggled with knee from that season venue issues were a continual problem for the team while in orleans in the first season they played in the university fieldhouse where the basketball court was raised high that the association made the team put a net around court so that players fall off of the court and into stands later they played games in the superdome but things were no better due to high demand for stadium onerous lease terms and constant knee they also faced the prospect of spending a whole month on the road year due to mardi gras festivities years founding owner sam battisone claimed that there was no plan in case the jazz ever made the playoffs however the manager at the time bill curl said that the always submitted a list of potential playoff dates to the management but these letters were never after what turned out to be their final season in the new orleans were dealt a further humiliation when the los angeles selected magic johnson with the first overall pick in nba draft the pick would have been the had they traded it to acquire gail goodrich two years earlier also jazz had given up the rights to moses malone in order to one of the three picks used for the goodrich trade combination of johnson and malone blossoming into hall of famers ineffective few years in new orleans this transaction one of the most lopsided in nba moving to despite being barely competitive the jazz drew well during their five years however by the franchise was sinking barry mendelson the executive vice president for most of early years said one factor in the financial trouble was an amusement tax highest in the nation at the time the team attract much local corporate important factor in those local battisone concluded that the franchise could not be viable in orleans and decided to move elsewhere after scouting several homes he decided to move to salt lake city even though it was smaller market however salt lake city had proven it could support pro basketball team when it played host to the american utah stars from to the stars been extremely popular in the city and had even won an aba title their first season after moving from los angeles however finances inexplicably collapsed in their last two seasons and were shut down by the league games into the season missing payroll although salt lake city was not known for its culture the team decided to keep the name as well as the original colors of green purple and gold the colors of mardi some were offended by the jazz keeping the franchise name after from new orleans citing it as a metaphor for the theft of jazz its cultural the frank layden the attendance declined slightly after the move from orleans to utah due to a late approval for the move june poor marketing in the salt lake city area the management made the first of several moves in forward adrian dantley to utah in exchange spencer haywood dantley averaged points per game during season allowing the team to waive pete maravich early the year the team struggled to a mark but was rewarded with nd overall pick in the nba draft which they used to darrell griffith of louisville another piece of the during the nba season they struggled financially as well as the court despite having perennial dantley a point game scorer in griffith as well as emerging point guard green the jazz were still unable to get above finishing tom nissalke departed as coach after they started the season and general manager frank layden replaced coaching an improvement initially as the jazz the rest of that season to finish the nba draft saw the jazz pick dominique wilkins jazz would have preferred to take either james worthy terry cummings but those players went to the lakers clippers respectively utah had been confident that the lakers take wilkins and that would have given them a shot at either of other top forwards they favored cummings over worthy because had shown he could play both small and power continued financial problems combined with wilkins making it clear did not want to play in utah resulted in the jazz sending wilkins atlanta in return for john drew and freeman williams this even considering the circumstances turned out to be one of the lopsided deals in nba history wilkins would go on to a hall of career while drew and williams would only play a combined four with the for the season dantley missed of games due to which deprived the team of its lead scorer for much of the newcomer john drew also missed time playing in only games the ended up being led by darrell griffith ppg rickey green ppg and danny schayes a rookie mark eaton manned the post the team finished still out the playoffs but an improvement over recent during the nba draft the jazz used their pick no overall to choose thurl bailey and later took bobby hansen the third round th opened as a season of uncertainty the team was losing and management was crafting stunts such as playing games in las to help the team become more profitable the team was to be moving due to cash shorts which were exacerbated the fact they were playing in the smallest market fortunes on the court improved with a healthy adrian jeff wilkins and rookie thurl bailey at the positions mark eaton rich kelley jointly manning the and rickey green with darrell griffith at the guards john drew providing points per night off the bench they

during the stay he arrived in france at a time of new fashions in art subject for his paintings was peasant life showing more of alignment with the established french barbizon school and artist millet than with newer artists manet and though his interest in depicting natural light parallels that of early impressionists there is no evidence of direct influence he was already a painter in america and had evolved a personal style which was much closer to manet monet unfortunately homer was very private about his life and his methods even denying his first biographer any information or commentary but his stance was clearly one independence of style and a devotion to american subjects as fellow artist eugene benson wrote homer believed that artists never look at pictures but should stutter in a language of throughout the s homer continued painting mostly rural or scenes of farm life children playing and young adults including country school and the morning bell in homer quit working as a

and sold more readily improving his financial condition they varied from highly detailed blackboard to impressionistic schooner at sunset some watercolors were as preparatory sketches for oil paintings as for breezing up some as finished works in themselves thereafter he seldom without paper brushes and water based as a result of disappointments with women or from some other turmoil homer

http://home.iprimus.com.au/korob/Orwell.html preface to animal farm mirror site free george orwell george orwell was the pseudonym of english author arthur blair born in in bengal where his father worked for opium department of the government of india his first book was down and out in paris and london dealing with his of poverty and homelessness in those two cities which researched by living as an indigent for some months for the publisher he produced the road to wigan pier which controversial for including trenchant criticism of intelligentsia alongside a larger attack on the flaws capitalism as exemplified in the wretched lives led by the poor orwell also wrote six fictional novels including animal and the as well as number of essay collections and an account of his involvement in spanish civil war homage to catalonia he died in after long battle with the essay below was written as a preface to the first edition of farm but was not included in the published book and only discovered the original typescript some years later it is now favourite citation for critics of our supposedly free press as illustration of how the media can work to suppress uncomfortable without this necessitating some vast conspiracy it is ironic the particular example of orwell referred to in essay was the refusal of the and liberal press of the time publish criticism of the soviet union not a major feature of media orthodoxy in later years indeed the subsequent popularity animal farm and had much to do with their usefulness in the ussr and international communism more usually of course attacks were simply on anyone or otherwise the was anxious to even now orwell is better known for two books apparently intended as critiques of socialism than for many works he wrote espousing socialism using works to generalised attacks on the left is problematic even for the two championed thus while animal farm is very clearly a deserved on the soviet union its greatest criticism of the russian leaders that they sold out socialist principle to accommodate themselves capitalist countries the creatures outside looked from pig to and from man to pig and from pig to man again but already it impossible to say which was which meanwhile is less attack on the left than a satiric extrapolation drawn from the of james the managerial revolution which predicted replacement of ideology with a new ruling class technocrats and social scientists this sixty year old idea is favoured by intellectuals of the fukuyama ilk difference being that they seem to some useful orwell chestnut tree o orwell orwell first maros orwell political orwell remembering students for an orwellian essays at project pynchon on while the prevailing orthodoxy of the dystopian society orwell in is termed english socialism this only goes to show that undoubtedly viewed the possibility of a socialist system perverted into oppressive militarist totalitarianism as more than the same happening in a capitalist state in the latter case least socialism would still be an alternative in any event orwell as a gadfly of socialism requires serious distortion of political viewpoint and the intention behind his writing his life orwell remained a confirmed socialist and worked exclusively for socialist journals indeed his often bitter of the british left might be seen to stem from his commitment to its essential positions orwell despised attacks on the right for the benefit of a satirising this preaching to the choir in as the duckspeak mindless ideologues rather what more important task was there for socialist intellectual than to warn fellow socialists where they going on the other hand given his thoroughly justified hatred stalinism it is possible that orwell would have made had he the same ideological journey burnham did from leftist to cold his distrust of the soviet union was forged in the spanish civil where he witnessed the betrayal of the left by in the years after the second world war argued that if such was the choice it would be better to be part the american empire than under the thumb of russia probably true an englishman a guatemalan might and despite a life emphasizing the importance of extending to our enemies considerations and freedoms we consider indispensable for orwell then spent much of his last years drawing up and lists of those of his fellow writers he considered to be soviet one might wish to cut a dying man some slack over such behaviour but even so for a long term champion of freedom humanity to act thus suggests that the danger of sliding into ways of thought as he termed them must be real robert the freedom of the this book was first thought of so far as the central idea goes but was not written down until about the end of by the when it came to be written it was obvious that there would be difficulty in getting it published in spite of the present shortage which ensures that anything describable as a book and in the event it was refused by four publishers only of these had any ideological motive two had been books for years and the other had no noticeable colour one publisher actually started by accepting the book but making the preliminary arrangements he decided to consult the of information who appear to have warned him or at any rate advised him against publishing it here is an extract from his i mentioned the reaction i had had from an important official in ministry of information with regard to animal farm i must that this expression of opinion has given me seriously to think i can see now that it might be regarded as something which it highly to publish at the present time if the fable addressed generally to dictators and dictatorships at large publication would be all right but the fable does follow as i now so completely the progress of the russian soviets and their dictators that it can apply only to russia to the exclusion of other dictatorships another thing it would be less offensive the predominant caste in the fable were not pigs it is not clear whether this suggested modification is mr own idea originated with the ministry of information but it seems to the official ring about it note i think the choice pigs as the ruling caste will no doubt give offence to many and particularly to anyone who is a bit touchy as undoubtedly russians this kind of thing is not a good symptom obviously it is not that a government department should have any power of except security censorship which no one objects to in war time books which are not officially sponsored but the chief danger freedom of thought and speech at this moment is not the interference of the moi or any official body if publishers and exert themselves to keep certain topics out of print it is not they are frightened of prosecution but because they are frightened public opinion in this country intellectual cowardice is the enemy a writer or journalist has to face and that fact does not to me to have had the discussion it any fairminded person with journalistic experience will admit during this war official censorship has not been particularly we have not been subjected to the kind of totalitarian that it might have been reasonable to expect the press has justified grievances but on the whole the government has behaved and has been surprisingly tolerant of minority opinions the fact about literary censorship in england is that it is voluntary unpopular ideas can be silenced and inconvenient facts dark without the need for any official ban anyone who has lived in a foreign country will know of instances of sensational items news things which on their own merits would get the big headlines being kept right out of the british press not because the intervened but because of a general tacit agreement that to mention that particular fact so far as the daily newspapers this is easy to understand the british press is extremely and most of it is owned by wealthy men who have every motive to dishonest on certain important topics but the same kind of censorship also operates in books and periodicals as well as in films and radio at any given moment there is an orthodoxy a body ideas which it is assumed that all people will without question it is not exactly forbidden to say this that or other but it is to say it just as in it was to mention trousers in the presence of a lady who challenges the prevailing orthodoxy finds himself silenced surprising effectiveness a genuinely unfashionable opinion is never given a fair hearing either in the popular press or in highbrow at this moment what is demanded by the prevailing orthodoxy is uncritical admiration of soviet russia knows this everyone acts on it any serious criticism of the soviet disclosure of facts which the soviet government would prefer to hidden is next door to unprintable and this conspiracy flatter our ally takes place curiously enough against a background genuine intellectual tolerance for though you are not allowed criticize the soviet government at least you are reasonably free criticize our own hardly anyone will print an attack on stalin but is quite safe to attack churchill at any rate in books periodicals and throughout five years of war during two or three which we were fighting for national survival countless pamphlets and articles advocating a compromise peace have published without interference more they have been published exciting much disapproval so long as the prestige of the ussr is involved the principle of free speech has been reasonably well there are other forbidden topics and i shall mention some of presently but the prevailing attitude towards the ussr is much most serious symptom it is as it were spontaneous and is not due the action of any pressure the servility with which the greater part of the english have swallowed and repeated russian propaganda from onwards be quite astounding if it were not that they have behaved similarly several earlier occasions on one controversial issue after another russian viewpoint has been accepted without examination and publicized with complete disregard to historical truth or decency to name only one instance the bbc celebrated the anniversary of the red army without mentioning trotsky this was as accurate as commemorating the battle of trafalgar without nelson but it evoked no protest from the english intelligentsia the internal struggles in the various occupied countries the press has in almost all cases sided with the faction favoured by russians and libelled the opposing faction sometimes material evidence in order to do so a particularly glaring case that of colonel mihailovich the jugoslav chetnik leader the who had their own jugoslav in marshal tito accused of collaborating with the germans this accusation was promptly up by the british press supporters were given no of answering it and facts contradicting it were simply kept out print in july of the germans offered a reward of crowns for the capture of tito and a similar reward for the capture mihailovich the british press the reward for tito but one paper mentioned in small print the reward for mihailovich the charges of collaborating with the germans continued very things happened during the spanish civil war then too the on the republican side which the russians were determined to crush recklessly libelled in the english leftwing press and any statement their defence even in letter form was refused publication at not only is serious criticism of the ussr considered reprehensible even the fact of the existence of such criticism is kept secret in cases for example shortly before his death trotsky had written biography of stalin one may assume that it was not an unbiased book but obviously it was saleable an american publisher arranged to issue it and the book was in print i believe the copies had been sent out when the ussr entered the war the book immediately withdrawn not a word about this has ever appeared in british press though clearly the existence of such a book and suppression was a news item worth a few it is important to distinguish between the kind of censorship that english literary intelligentsia voluntarily impose upon themselves the censorship that can sometimes be enforced by pressure notoriously certain topics cannot be discussed because of the case is the patent medicine racket the catholic church has considerable influence in the press and silence criticism of itself to some extent a scandal involving catholic priest is almost never given publicity whereas an priest who gets into trouble eg the rector of stiffkey is news it is very rare for anything of an tendency appear on the stage or in a film any actor can tell you that a play film which attacks or makes fun of the catholic church is liable to boycotted in the press and will probably be a failure but this kind thing is harmless or at least it is understandable any organization will look after its own interests as best it can overt propaganda is not a thing to object to one would no more the daily worker to publicize unfavourable facts about the ussr one would expect the catholic herald to denounce the pope but every thinking person knows the daily worker and the catholic for what they are what is disquieting is that where the ussr and policies are concerned one cannot expect intelligent criticism or in many cases plain honesty from liberal writers and journalists are under no direct pressure to falsify their opinions stalin sacrosanct and certain aspects of his policy must not be discussed this rule has been almost universally observed since but it had operated to a greater extent than is sometimes for ten years earlier than that throughout that time criticism of soviet from the left could only obtain a hearing difficulty there was a huge output of literature nearly all of it was from the conservative angle and dishonest out of date and actuated by sordid motives on the side there was an equally huge and almost equally dishonest stream propaganda and what amounted to a boycott on anyone tried to discuss questions in a manner could indeed publish books but to do so was to sure of being ignored or misrepresented by nearly the whole of highbrow press both publicly and privately you were warned that it what you said might possibly be true but it and into the hands this or that interest this attitude was usually defended on the ground that international situation and the urgent need for an alliance demanded it but it was clear that this was rationalization the english intelligentsia or a great part of it developed a nationalistic loyalty towards the ussr and in their they felt that to cast any doubt on the wisdom of stalin was a kind blasphemy events in russia and events elsewhere were to be judged different standards the endless executions in the purges of were applauded by opponents of capital punishment and it considered equally proper to publicize famines when they happened india and to conceal them when they happened in the ukraine and this was true before the war the intellectual atmosphere is no better but now to come back to this book of mine the reaction towards it most english intellectuals will be quite simple to been naturally those reviewers who understand the art denigration will not attack it on political grounds but on ones they will say that it is a dull silly book and a waste of paper this may well be true but it is obviously not whole of the story one does not say that a book not to been merely because it is a bad book after all acres rubbish are printed daily and no one bothers the intelligentsia or most of them will object to this book because traduces their leader and as they see it does harm to the cause progress if it did the opposite they would have nothing to say it even if its literary faults were ten times as glaring as they the success of for instance the left book club over a period of or five years shows how willing they are to tolerate both and slipshod writing provided that it tells them what they want the issue involved here is quite a simple one is every however unpopular however foolish even entitled to a hearing it in that form and nearly any english intellectual will feel that ought to say but give it a concrete shape and ask an attack on stalin is that entitled to a and the more often than not will be in that case the current happens to be challenged and so the principle of free speech now when one demands liberty of speech and of the press one is demanding absolute liberty there always must be or at any rate always will be some degree of censorship so long as societies endure but freedom as rosa luxembourg said is the other the same principle is contained in the famous of voltaire detest what you say i will defend to the death right to say if the intellectual liberty which without a doubt been one of the distinguishing marks of western civilization anything at all it means that everyone shall have the right to say to print what he believes to be the truth provided only that it not harm the rest of the community in some quite unmistakable way capitalist democracy and the western versions of socialism have recently taken that principle for granted our government as i already pointed out still makes some show of respecting it ordinary people in the street partly perhaps because they are sufficiently interested in ideas to be intolerant about them vaguely hold that suppose got a right to their it is only or at any rate it is chiefly the literary scientific intelligentsia the very people who ought to be guardians of liberty who are beginning to despise it in theory well as in one of the peculiar phenomena of our time is the renegade liberal and above the familiar marxist claim that is illusion there is now a widespread tendency to argue that one can defend democracy by totalitarian methods if one loves democracy argument runs one must crush its enemies by no matter what means who are its enemies it always appears that they are not only those attack it openly and consciously but those who it by spreading mistaken doctrines in other words defending involves destroying all independence of thought this argument used for instance to justify the russian purges the most russophile hardly believed that all of the victims were guilty of the things they were accused of but by holding heretical opinions harmed the and therefore it was quite right only to massacre them but to discredit them by false accusations same argument was used to justify the quite conscious lying that on in the leftwing press about the trotskyists and other minorities in the spanish civil war and it was used again as a for yelping against habeas corpus when mosley was released in these people see that if you encourage totalitarian methods time may come when they will be used against you instead of for make a habit of imprisoning fascists without trial and perhaps process stop at fascists soon after the suppressed daily had been reinstated i was lecturing to a college in london the audience were and intellectuals the same sort of audience that one used to meet at book club branches the lecture had touched on the freedom of press and at the end to my astonishment several questioners stood and asked me did i not think that the lifting of the ban on the worker was a great mistake when asked why they said that it was paper of doubtful loyalty and ought not to be tolerated in war time found myself defending the daily worker which has gone out of its to libel me more than once but where had these people learned essentially totalitarian outlook pretty certainly they had learned from the communists themselves tolerance and decency are deeply in england but they are not indestructible and they have to be alive partly by conscious effort the result of preaching doctrines is to weaken the instinct by means of which free peoples what is or is not dangerous the case of mosley illustrates this it was perfectly right to intern mosley whether or not he committed any technical crime we were fighting for our lives and not allow a possible quisling to go free to keep him shut up trial in was an outrage the general failure to see this was bad symptom though it is true that the agitation against release was partly factitious and partly a rationalization of discontents but how much of the present slide towards fascist ways thought is traceable to the of the past ten years the unscrupulousness it has it is important to realize that the current russomania is only symptom of the general weakening of the western liberal tradition the moi chipped in and definitely vetoed the publication of this the bulk of the english intelligentsia would have seen disquieting in this uncritical loyalty to the ussr happens to be current orthodoxy and where the supposed interests of the ussr involved they are willing to tolerate not only censorship but deliberate falsification of history to name one instance at the of john reed the author of ten days that shook the world account of the early days of the russian revolution copyright of the book passed into the hands of the british party to whom i believe reed had bequeathed it some years later british communists having destroyed the original edition of the as completely as they could issued a garbled version from which had eliminated mentions of trotsky and also omitted the written by lenin if a radical intelligentsia had still existed britain this act of forgery would have been exposed and denounced every literary paper in the country as it was there was little or protest to many english intellectuals it seemed quite a natural to do and this tolerance or of plain dishonesty means much than that admiration for russia happens to be fashionable at moment quite possibly that particular fashion will not last for all know by the time this book is published my view of the soviet may be the one but what use would that be itself to exchange one orthodoxy for another is not necessarily advance the enemy is the gramophone mind whether or not one with the record that is being played at the i am well acquainted with all the arguments against freedom of and speech the arguments which claim that it cannot exist and arguments which claim that it ought not to i answer simply that convince me and that our civilization over a period of hundred years has been founded on the opposite notice for quite decade past i have believed that the existing russian is mainly evil thing and i claim the right to say so in spite of fact that we are allies with the ussr in a war which i want to see if i had to choose a text to justify myself i should choose the from by the known rules of ancient the word ancient emphasizes the fact that intellectual freedom is tradition without which our characteristic western could only doubtfully exist from that tradition many of intellectuals are visibly turning away they have accepted principle that a book should be published or suppressed praised damned not on its merits but according to political expediency others who do not actually hold this view assent to it from cowardice an example of this is the failure of the numerous and english pacifists to raise their voices against the prevalent of russian militarism according to those pacifists all violence evil and they have urged us at every stage of the war to give in or least to make a compromise peace but how many of them have suggested that war is also evil when it is waged by the red apparently the russians have a right to defend themselves whereas us to do so is a deadly sin one can only explain this in one way that is by a cowardly desire to keep in with the bulk the intelligentsia whose patriotism is directed towards the rather than towards britain i know that the english have plenty of reason for their timidity and dishonesty indeed i by heart the arguments by which they justify themselves but at let us have no more nonsense about defending liberty against if liberty means anything at all it means the right to tell people they do not want to hear the common people still vaguely subscribe that doctrine and act on it in our country it is not the same in countries it was not so in republican france top of page and is not so in the usa today ie it is the liberals who liberty and the intellectuals who want to do dirt on the intellect is to draw attention to that fact that i have written this and just for the sake of completeness this was preface the ukrainian edition of the preface to the ukrainian i have been asked to write a preface to the ukrainian translation animal farm i am aware that i write for readers about whom i nothing but also that they too have probably never had the opportunity to know anything about in this preface they will most likely expect me to say something of animal farm originated but first i would like to say something myself and the experiences by which i arrived at my political i was born in india in my father was an official in the administration there and my family was one of those families of soldiers clergymen government teachers lawyers doctors etc i was educated at eton the costly and snobbish of the english public schools but i had only in there by means of a scholarship otherwise my father could not afforded to send me to a school of this shortly after i left school i quite twenty years old then went to burma and joined the indian imperial police this was an police a sort of gendarmerie very similar to the spanish guardia or the garde mobile in france i stayed five years in the service did not suit me and made me hate imperialism although at that nationalist feelings in burma were not very marked and between the english and the burmese were not particularly when on leave in england in i resigned from the service decided to become a writer at first without any especial success i lived in paris and wrote short stories and novels that would print i have since destroyed them in the following years lived mostly from hand to mouth and went hungry on several it was only from onwards that i was able to live on what i from my writing in the meantime i sometimes lived for months on amongst the poor and elements who inhabit the worst of the poorer quarters or take to the streets begging and at that time i associated with them through lack of money but their way of life interested me very much for its own sake i many months more systematically this time studying the conditions the miners in the north of england up to i did not on the look upon myself as a socialist in fact i had as yet no defined political views i became more out of with the way the poorer section of the industrial workers oppressed and neglected than out of any theoretical admiration for planned in i got married in almost the same week the civil war broke in spain my wife and i both wanted to go to spain and fight for spanish government we were ready in six months as soon as i finished the book i was writing in spain i spent almost six months the aragon front until at huesca a fascist sniper shot me through in the early stages of the war foreigners were on the whole unaware the inner struggles between the various political parties the government through a series of accidents i joined not international brigade like the majority of foreigners but the militia ie the spanish so in the middle of when the communists gained control partial control of the spanish government and began to hunt down trotskyists we both found ourselves amongst the victims we were lucky to get out of spain alive and not even to have been once many of our friends were shot and others spent a long time prison or simply these in spain went on at the same time as the great in the ussr and were a sort of supplement to them in spain as well in russia the nature of the accusations namely conspiracy with fascists was the same and as far as spain was concerned i had reason to believe that the accusations were false to experience this was a valuable object lesson it taught me how easily propaganda can control the opinion of enlightened people in my wife and i both saw innocent people being thrown into prison because they were suspected of unorthodoxy yet on our return england we found numerous sensible and believing the most fantastic accounts of conspiracy treachery sabotage which the press reported from the moscow and so i understood more clearly than ever the negative influence the soviet myth upon the western socialist and here i must pause to describe my attitude to the soviet i have never visited russia and my knowledge of it consists only what can be learned by reading books and newspapers even if i had power i would not wish to interfere in soviet domestic affairs would not condemn stalin and his associates merely for their and undemocratic methods it is quite possible that even with the intentions they could not have acted otherwise under the prevailing but on the other hand it was of the utmost importance to me that in western europe should see the soviet regime for what it really since i had seen little evidence that the ussr was towards anything that one could truly call socialism on the i was struck by clear signs of its transformation into a society in which the rulers have no more reason to give up their than any other ruling class moreover the workers and in a country like england cannot understand that the ussr of today altogether different from what it was in it is partly that do not want to understand ie they want to believe that somewhere really socialist country does actually exist and partly that accustomed to comparative freedom and moderation in public totalitarianism is completely incomprehensible to yet one must remember that england is not completely democratic it also a capitalist country with great class privileges and even after a war that has tended to equalise everybody with differences in wealth but nevertheless it is a country in which have lived together for several hundred years without major in which the laws are relatively just and official news and can almost invariably be believed and last but not least in which hold and to voice minority views does not involve any mortal danger such an atmosphere the man in the street has no real understanding things like concentration camps mass deportations arrests trial press censorship etc everything he reads about a country the ussr is automatically translated into english terms and he innocently accepts the lies of totalitarian propaganda up to even later the majority of english people were incapable of the true nature of the nazi regime in germany and now with the regime they are still to a large extent under the same sort this has caused great harm to the socialist movement in england had serious consequences for english foreign policy indeed in opinion nothing has contributed so much to the corruption of original idea of socialism as the belief that russia is a country and that every act of its rulers must be excused if and so for the past ten years i have been convinced that destruction of the soviet myth was essential if we wanted a revival the socialist on my return from spain i thought of exposing the soviet myth in story that could be easily understood by almost anyone and which be easily translated into other languages however the actual of the story did not come to me for some time until one day i was living in a small village i saw a little boy perhaps ten years driving a huge along a narrow path whipping it whenever tried to turn it struck me that if only such animals became aware their strength we should have no power over them and that men animals in much the same way as the rich exploit the i proceeded to analyse theory from the point of to them it was clear that the concept of a class struggle humans was pure illusion since whenever it was necessary to animals all humans united against them the true struggle is animals and humans from this point of departure it was not to elaborate the story i did not write it out till for i always engaged on other work which gave me no time and in the end included some events for example the teheran conference which taking place while i was writing thus the main outlines of the were in my mind over a period of six years before it was i do not wish to comment on the work if it does not speak for it is a failure but i should like to emphasise two points first although the various episodes are taken from the actual history of russian revolution they are dealt with schematically and chronological order is changed this was necessary for the symmetry the story the second point has been missed by most critics because i did not emphasise it sufficiently a number of readers finish the book with the impression that it ends in the reconciliation of the pigs and the humans that was not my on the contrary i meant it to end on a loud note of discord for wrote it immediately after the teheran conference which thought had established the best possible relations between the and the west i personally did not believe that such good would last long and as events have shown i far i know what more i need add if anyone is interested in details i should add that i am a widower with a son almost three old that by profession i am a writer and that since the beginning the war i have worked mainly as a the periodical to which i contribute most regularly is tribune sociopolitical weekly which represents generally speaking the wing of the labour party the following of my books might most the ordinary reader should any reader of this translation find of them burmese days a story about burma homage to arising from my experiences in the spanish civil war and essays essays mainly about contemporary popular english literature instructive more from the sociological than from the literary point these are not public but something quite opposite exclusive and expensive residential secondary scattered far apart until recently they admitted almost no one the sons of rich aristocratic families it was the dream of riche bankers of the nineteenth century to push their sons into public school at such schools the greatest stress is laid on which forms so to speak a lordly tough and gentlemanly among these schools eton is particularly famous wellington reported to have said that the victory of waterloo was decided the playing fields of eton it is not so very long ago that overwhelming majority of the people who in one way or another england came from the public school top of note by ukrainian edition one would mean an edition in the language not an edition published in penguin included an explanatory appendix to their recent edition included the preface as follows taken from o the ukrainian translation of animal farm was intended for living in the camps for displaced persons in germany under british american administration after world war ii these as indicated in letter from the man who organised the translation and ihor szewczenko igor shevchenko were people who supported october revolution and who were determined to defend what had been but who had turned against the bonapartism stalin and the russian nationalistic exploitation of the people they were simple people peasants and workers but all of whom read eagerly for these people he orwell to write a special introduction the english original has lost and the version reproduced here is a recasting back into of the ukrainian version orwell insisted that he receive no for this edition nor for other

being interesting things i hate about you patriot and moving his career to his own fascinating frequency the ledger eschewed the predictable romantic hero leading roles that could have followed his splashy sexy vanity cover anointing him as the latest stud du jour it reads like terrific career move an initial sacrifice but ultimately a step toward serious movie stardom but watching ledger skillfully into the skin of a depressive young man in ball or embody a brash sexy rake in casanova i the actor having any kind of choice he was just too sensitive interesting too intelligent an actor to not make any part uniquely own and exciting watching his psychopathic perfectly hideous in the trailer for christopher upcoming batman the dark knight gives me chills not only for the dual thrill seeing two of greatest chameleonlike talents bale and ledger who were also terrific in todd dylan meditation not there pitted against one another for maniacal edgier take on the legendary ability to create a joker jack appears to be unquestionable and this was clearly yet important transformative moment in the but discussing career in the past tense something having a tough time wrapping my mind around he was one of my working actors an actor been advocating and arguing for someone special and different since his earlier roles and an actor now find myself cherishing like many of you i was absolutely and depressed to learn of his death i can barely grasp the as i write this right now he was only years old he was in middle of terry newest picture an admirable task in spite of how great

sample reprint in pdf format order a reprint this article the wall street the digital june out the spend two weeks using device to see if it to the hype in search of the comma stock more in personal technology find new walter s mossberg and katherine one of the most important trends in personal technology over the few years has been the evolution of the humble cellphone into a handheld computer a device able to replicate many of the key of a laptop but most of these smart phones have had lousy confusing user interfaces and clumsy music video and photo and their designers have struggled to balance screen size usability and battery now apple inc whose digital products are hailed for design and innovation is jumping into this market with iphone which goes on sale in a few days after months of the frenzied hype and speculation we have ever seen for a single product even though the minimum price is a hefty are already lining up outside apple stores to be among the first snag one when they go on sale friday we have been testing the iphone for two weeks in multiple scenarios in cities across the country our verdict is that some flaws and feature omissions the iphone is on balance beautiful and breakthrough handheld computer its software sets a new bar for the industry and its interface which dispenses with a stylus and most works well though it sometimes adds steps to common the apple phone combines intelligent voice calling and a ipod with a beautiful new interface for music and video playback offers the best web browser we have seen on a smart phone and email software and it synchronizes easily and well with both and macintosh computers using itunes it has the largest and screen of any smart seen and the most internal memory by far yet it is one of thinnest smart phones available and offers impressive battery better than its key competitors the phone is thinner than many smart it feels solid and comfortable in the hand and the way it photos videos and web pages on its gorgeous screen makes other phones look the most controversial feature the omission of a keyboard in favor of a virtual keyboard on the screen turned out our tests to be a nonissue despite our deep initial skepticism five days of use walt who did most of the testing for this was able to type on it as quickly and accurately as he could on palm treo he has used for years this was partly because of software that corrects typing errors on the but the iphone has a major drawback the cellphone network it uses only works with formerly cingular come in models that verizon or sprint and use the digital cards called sim that would allow it to run on network so the phone can a poor choice unless you are in areas where coverage is good does work overseas but only via an roaming in addition even when you have great coverage the iphone run on fastest cellular data network instead it uses a network called edge which is far slower than the fastest networks verizon or sprint that power many other smart phones and the iphone model cannot be upgraded to use the faster the iphone compensates by being one of the few smart phones that also use wireless networks when you have access to iphone flies on the web not only that but the iphone switches from edge to known networks when it finds them and up a list of new networks it encounters as you move walt able to log onto paid networks at starbucks and airports even used a free network at fenway park in boston to pictures taken during a red sox on iphone jobs answers iphone question of the day apart from talking what do you use cellphone for the all things d digital daily iphone review mossberg columns videos and more at the all things web but this capability fully make up for the lack of a cellular data capability because it is impractical to keep joining dropping networks while taking a long walk or in a cab through a is offering special monthly calling plans for the iphone all which include unlimited internet and email usage they range from to depending on the number of voice minutes included in unusual twist iphone buyers choose their plans and their phones in the store instead they will do so when they connect the iphone to the itunes despite its simple interface with just four rows of colorful icons a black background the iphone has too many features and functions detail completely in this space but a rundown of the features with pros and cons based on our hardware the iphone is simply beautiful it is thinner than the samsung blackjack yet almost its entire surface is covered by a vivid display no physical keyboard just a button that takes you to the home screen the phone is about as long the treo the blackberry or the blackjack but wider than the blackjack or treo and heavier than the blackberry the display is made of a sturdy glass not plastic and while it pick up smudges it acquire a single scratch even though it tossed into pocket or briefcase or purse without protective case or holster no scratches appeared on the rest of body there are only three buttons along the edges on the top that puts the phone to sleep and wakes it up and on the left a volume control and a mute one downside some accessories for ipods may not work properly on iphone the headphone jack which supports both stereo music and calls is deeply recessed so you may need an adapter for headphones and while the iphone uses the standard ipod port on bottom edge it recognize all car adapters for playing only for charging apple is considering a software update to fix interface to go through long lists of emails or songs you just flick with your finger to select items you to enlarge photos you pinch them by placing two fingers on corners and dragging them in or out to zoom in on portions of pages you with your fingers you cannot use a stylus any of this in the web browser and photo program if you turn phone from a vertical to a horizontal position the image on the turns as well and resizes itself to in general we found this interface called to effective practical and fun but no overall search on iphone except web searching and no quick way to move to the top bottom of pages except in the web the only aid is alphabetical scale on the right in tiny also no way to cut copy or paste and the lack of dedicated hardware buttons for functions like email and contacts means extra taps are needed to start using also if you are playing music while doing something else the lack hardware playback buttons forces you to return to the ipod program stop the music or change a keyboard the virtual keys are large and get larger as you touch software tries to guess what typing and fix errors overall works but the system seem as clever as the on the blackberry and you have to switch to a different keyboard to insert a period or comma which is web browsing the iphone is the first smart phone tested with real web browser a version of safari displays entire web pages in their real layouts and allows you zoom in quickly by either tapping or pinching with your multiple pages can be open at the same time and you can conduct or yahoo searches from a search email the iphone can connect with most popular consumer services including yahoo gmail aol earthlink and others it also handle corporate email using exchange system if it department cooperates by enabling a setting on the blackberry email services be used on an iphone but yahoo supplies free push email to iphone users in test this worked unlike most phone email software the shows a preview of message so you have to open it and if there is a attached it shows the photo automatically without requiring you click on a link to see it it can also receive and open microsoft and excel documents and adobe pdf files but it allow you edit or save these memory the base model comes with four gigabytes of memory the model has eight gigabytes far more than on any smart phone but much less than on ipods also slot for cards our test model held a dozen videos including a movie over photos over emails including some attachments and still had room battery life like the ipod but unlike most cellphones the lacks a removable battery so you carry a spare but its life is excellent in our tests it got seven hours and minutes continuous talk time while the was on and email was being fetched in the background close to claim of maximum of eight hours and far exceeds the talk time claims of smart phones which usually top out at five and a half the interface features cover flow technology for flipping album for continuous music playback again with on and email fetched we got over hours shy of claim of up to but still huge for video playback under the same conditions we just under claim of seven hours enough to watch movies and for web browsing and other functions including sending and receiving emails viewing google and youtube videos we got over nine hours well above claim up to six in real life of course you will do a mix of these things so the gauge might be that in our test the iphone generally all day with a typical mix of phone calls the phone interface is clean and simple but takes taps to reach than on many other smart phones because there are dedicated hardware phone buttons you also cannot just start typing name or number but must scroll through a list of favorites your recent call list or your entire contact list you can also use virtual one great phone feature is called visual voice mail it shows you names or at least the phone numbers of people who have left voicemail so you can quickly listen to those you want also easy to turn the speakerphone on and off or to establish voice call quality was good but not great in some places in weak coverage areas there was some muffling or garbling but calls were perfectly audible the iphone can use bluetooth headsets and it comes with wired earbuds that include iphone with google google maps on the a downside no easy way to transfer phone numbers via directly from an existing phone the iphone is meant to sync with address book and calendar on a contacts and calendars these are pretty straightforward and work the calendar lacks a week view though a list view helps fill that contacts can be gathered into groups but the groups be used email distribution syncing the iphone syncs with both macs and windows pcs using which handles not only the transfer of music and video but photos contacts calendar items and browser bookmarks in our this worked well even on a windows vista machine using the version of outlook as the source for contacts and ipod the ipod handles music and video perfectly and has the features of a regular ipod but the interface is entirely new famed scroll wheel is gone and instead finger taps and flicking you through your collection and virtual controls appear on the also a version of the cover flow interface which allows to select music by flipping through album other features there are widgets or small programs for weather stock prices and google maps which includes route but no navigation another widget allows you to stream from youtube and yet another serves as a notepad a program that displays individual pictures or the only software apple is allowing will be that must be accessed through the web browser the says these can be made to look just like programs but the we tried missing features the iphone is missing some features common on competitors no instant messaging only standard messaging while its camera took excellent pictures our tests it record video its otherwise excellent web fully utilize some web sites because it yet flash technology although the phone contains a complete you use your songs as ringtones there any games nor there any way to directly access

in morocco they met in paris in when christo commissioned to paint a portrait of mother since time they have collaborated on an impressive oeuvre of artistic the wrapping of the reichstag in the summer of once again the christos in the spotlight of the international art world a stage position they have held several times before in during installation of the umbrellas in with pont neuf wrapped paris in with the installation the running fence sonoma and marin counties california so on back to their first collaborations in on the docks of cologne link to wrapped reichstag berlin christo and photo wolfgang yet it would be incorrect to associate christo and with these particular high points the previously installations took years of planning the considerable activity precede the installation of a piece is as much a part of a work as the actual installation it took years before reichstag could be wrapped seven years to organize the umbrellas years to plan the pont neuf wrapped and three years for the islands in biscayne bay numerous books and videos have the remarkable succession of zoning board hearings public parliamentary debates public and private meetings legal releases contract negotiations press conferences tests collages exhibitions as well as the enormous effort and required for the actual link to over the river project for arkansas river collage photo wolfgang this is why each particular progression of activities is referred to as a project and the dates for each piece start with inception of the project idea and end with the of piece currently the christos are engaged in two projects the project for central park new york city in progress and the river project for the arkansas river colorado in individual aspects of the art may be linked to any number artistic precursors yet in its totality their work is truly their oeuvre has been approached critically via its resonance constructivism nouveau happenings conceptual art land and the tradition of draped figures in art especially those of and rodin yet any single point of entry must be left behind if one to fully appreciate the unparalleled link to valley photo harry of the many perspectives from which one can investigate the art it is the use of fabric as an agent for transformation revelation that is perhaps most crucial the wrapping or surrounding familiar objects the curtaining off of familiar views intervention of fabric where one least expects it undermines comfortable residence with the accustomed and creates a sense dislocation this substitution of a more ambivalent than presence for the predictable is one of the key elements of their yet the wrapping draping surrounding or veiling action of the does not dissolve the known rather it recontextualizes it within variety of corresponding associations as the curtain surges in wind as the wrapping billows over a form the surface serves as a mediator between our preexisting concerning a particular condition and inferences of shifting visually the wrapping of an object reveals its essential forms as swell beneath the fabric volumes and shapes lost when seen with usually coexistant forest of details become paramount when sheathed in the pont neuf link to the pont neuf photo wolfgang volz spacergif wrapped photo ak existing cultural contextualizations associated with an object and milieu may serve as springboards for revisional analysis when object is veiled the wrapping of the reichstag raised political and historical issues including the failed earlier at a parliamentary system of government by a unified german with the dismantling of the wall and the reunification of germany wrapped reichstag serves as a sort of tabula rasa against which questions may be posed not just by the german people or the community but indeed by the entire the final realization of a project by christo and is the installation of a particular piece a project is not until the installation is removed and the site is returned to normal state yet that formerly inviolate condition has been altered by the installation and the lingering resonance it behind while the fabrics ropes cables poles and whatever materials used in an installation will be recycled and the returned to its status the uncertainties questions raised by the efforts remain dispersed among those who have been engaged by the project this process reevaluation continues long after the project is supposedly this creation of permanent states of reconsideration instigated work which is temporary by design is perhaps the by peter stanford christo

http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page3/story?page=10bqs/hamilton by miki special to page beverly hills for a man born in a bathysphere an underwater with reduced gravity laird hamilton certainly has an idyllic he has a beautiful wife former pro beach volleyball star reece they have a lovely daughter reece viola and the surfer dude tall tan and tough as gabrielle reece laird gabrielle reece and laird daughter learned the arm from surfer and not all hamilton the son of legendary surfer hamilton is considered the best and most innovative big wave rider the some of his greatness along with the feats of his watermen is nicely presented in a new feature documentary riding giants the film which hamilton also produced hits in select cities this if you love surfing or just want to know more about the sport be to hang ten on this wave this film will take you where you want to there are thrills spills and an intimate look at the athletes essentially risk their lives every time they paddle in burning questions hamilton who was born in san francisco grew up in hawaii talks about the film his passion for surfing his way of how daunting was it for you to be involved on both ends of camera as a producer and laird hamilton it was a huge honor to get this film made first of actually it was an honor to pay homage to the hawaiians original pioneers of big wave riding and then just march our along i wish i could have only paid my respect to all the people i respect but that would too many how long did it take to pull this documentary been trying to build the film for about four or five years then met stacy peralta and him having been a surfer i thought we were step closer to getting it made that was a prerequisite having someone who knew about surfing from personal experience once got him and the studio said ok to him directing that whole started why did you want to do this kind of i just want people to know our story i want people to know about history in most other sports you know all the history for you to be more attached to the sport the legend of so and so the greats of all these sports with surfing people are attracted it and they like it and the clothes are cool and the locations desirable but they really know much about because of the beach boys and beach blanket bingo a lot of might think that surfing culture originated from california real riding with riding giants laird hamilton hopes to dispel the people have of everybody only knows what they know about where it came from is the sports of hawaiians but polynesians who were the navigators our planet has ever known they navigated by stars sailed around the world an ancient sport we know how years we know more than hundreds years old that in itself it something the sport of kings the ability to ride a wave people around the ocean the essence the ocean in its majesty and if you can actually have the skill to master that was it kind of that be a surfer with your being one and you being born in that water i believe in things being in a way i feel like i fortunate that i was raised in the right place had the right kind background and childhood i had the right circumstances to create and what i am almost like how it was for the big waves to a good wave you need all of these pieces you need the wind from right angle with the swell and the tide and all these variables to together been fortunate enough to be the recipient of has there been any point in your career where riding a something went wrong and you thought you going to make well tahiti a scene in the that wave in tahiti was one those moments that i questioned the success of that ride during right in the apex of it i was seriously questioning whether it and i had this voice telling me to jump off i was having internal battle as to what to do had some heavy situations when was young too because of growing up in hawaii around the ocean i a lot of really powerful things on me when i was young that had a greater impact then when you get older they seem as any encounters with sharks or other dangerous sea seen big sharks yeah been lost at sea trapped waterfalls had some great stuff my mom was surprised i it to so the fact that a huge leap right there the whole nine lives thing there were a few times i taken out but still here i promised turn from my sinful can you kind of put into words what like to ride that big all the way a very difficult question like describing a color words if never seen any colors and you go hey describe a sensation like if the fastest ever been or flying or some situation where the moment is so intense it so much focus that you see anything else almost like twilight zone where time stops for a moment and in a place there is no beginning and no end probably one of the truest of living in the moment that we have on this earthly plane before what was the best advice your dad ever gave you about riding hamilton enjoying a big wave in riding well my dad said never do a sport where all the best guys in the are people describe you as an old school surfer the between the old school and the new i think sometimes people have a tendency to be very they think only one discipline in the surf when they refer me as old school i think because not flashy surfer guy not riding the little tiny board and riding the small waves i did when i was this is the part of the sport big wave there are men and there are kids for me big wave riding is for men there are young guys doing it but at the end of the day got to do it for a few years to be a mature big wave rider it time i just do a lot of traditional stuff i ride long paddle i surf in contests because i never liked whole judgmental thing i just never have fit into a box had a bunch of speaking of old school what do you think about the fox series i laughed when i saw it it is so way off course things like show that make all of us look really unflattering and perpetuates surfer dude mentality thing why i made riding giants show north shore is absolutely your own kid has to have incredible athletic genes so is she surfer or a beach volleyball you know what tell you not little league parents gaby i i think it would be an unbelievable sadness or disappointment make your kids do something you want to do that you want for you the children just going to provide opportunity and exposure windsurfing snowboarding film

http://writ.news.findlaw.com/dean/20020607.html legal are you a legal visit our professional law firm learn about the find a findlaw forms print this powers in times of terrorism result in a constitutional by john w friday jun at present the president has opted to exercise only a few of emergency powers under the national emergencies act at this time is only utilizing provisions relating to the will the president choose to use additional powers it depends on future because we know what shape this undeclared war terrorism will take we know what powers this president or successor might need to cope with the problems of an american president should he need them possesses awesome those powers potentially include what political scientists described as the powers of a constitutional dictatorship president has ever had to go that far although they have come now however it is not difficult to conceive of scenarios terrorist groups on our destruction and refusing to abide any known rules of war could employ weapons of mass destruction in a manner that could threaten our existence as nation what happens democracy in crisis will it transform into another form of democracy works best in times of peace when there is compromise and deliberation in forming governing rules and policies when confronted with a major crisis particularly that is like terrorism of an unfamiliar nature the nation will to the president for initiative and resolute leadership if our existence and way of life are threatened americans will want president to do whatever is the history of democratic governments from the ancient republics greece and rome to the modern states that have replaced totalitarian governments show that governing by committees legislative bodies never works in times of crisis fortunately founders were aware of this when they designed our alexander hamilton explained in federalist no that the nature of the chief executive is his energy which is a element in the definition of good government it is essential to protection of the community against foreign attacks it is no essential to the steady administration of the laws to the of property against those irregular and combinations sometimes interrupt the ordinary course of justice to the security liberty against the enterprises and assaults of ambition of and of while our constitution contains no express provision for emergency crisis situations such a provision is not necessary the supreme court made clear in ex parte milligan following the civil that the government within the constitution has all the granted to it which are necessary to preserve its existence or as commentator has added is the first law of past presidents principally abraham lincoln woodrow wilson franklin roosevelt by exercising their powers in time of have expanded their authority as necessary to meet emergencies faced they have in essence made the law in times of crisis always in the manner lincoln launched the civil war unilaterally without action following the secession of seven southern states only did he obtain congressional approval his critics called him dictator but he got the job done that had to be wilson asked for and received near dictatorial powers from when attacks by germany against american ships and submarines the nation into world war i he had to raise and equip a large army fight on foreign soil to do so he demanded and received new power and when franklin roosevelt was inaugurated in the depression had reached its depths the new president promised and during his first days congress gave him what he needed enable him to use federal powers to rout the depression and every sector of the economy as well as state and local from economic later following the attack on pearl harbor which forced united states into world war ii exertion of his powers would far exceed anything wilson or lincoln had done the strength of his personality roosevelt lead the nation from day of infamy through battles in europe africa asia and the to total while fdr continued to ask congress for what he needed he gave them choice as to whether they would accede for example in demanding congress repeal provisions in the price control act ceilings on certain food products he told the congress in the the congress should fail to act and act adequately i shall accept responsibility and i will act and he reminded the congress president has the power to take measures necessary to avert disaster which would interfere with winning of the been blessed with strong presidents in times of national they were men who demonstrated a capacity for leadership and men acted undemocratically but only to preserve our been fortunate for the distinction between a dictator and a strong president is remarkably thin if as writ columnist michael dorf has noted there few checks on our commander in constitutional dictatorships what happens to democracies rossiter looked at the phenomenon of constitutional dictatorships the aftermath of world war ii for he was concerned that more than fewer periods of crisis lay ahead in dictatorship he examines the experiences of crisis governments from the ancient constitutional state of rome to four modern germany france great britain and the united states focusing four major crises in the united states the civil war the two wars and the great professor albert sturm a student of work has also of constitutional dictatorships in a essay emergencies and presidency in the journal of politics for example sturm found these temporary concentrations of power in an executive for emergencies which have been employed by vigorous democracies ancient times are necessary for the preservation of the system in the face of temporary crisis typically such lasts only as long as the crisis sturm notes and it is sanctioned the existing constitutional constitutional dictatorship could it happen of course the very concept of a dictatorship is offensive inimical to our political thinking as citizens of a democracy rossiter acknowledges that no american government has ever been a constitutional dictatorship as that concept is understood by of government rather he uses the term in the american context convenient hyperbole an exaggeration meant to underscore how and how extensive have been the powers american presidents necessarily arrogated to themselves in nevertheless rossiter and other students of dictatorships do not rule out the idea that one could ever exist america indeed they raised questions in the aftermath of world war that are still relevant today as we find ourselves in an war and the first stages of emergency recall that fdr took the nation from a limited national emergency september to an unlimited emergency by may then to total war by december anyone who does not believe war on terrorism will escalate as well is in rossiter does not address the question of whether americans tolerate the undemocratic ways of a constitutional instead he is interested in the question of whether we could the alternative he asks that is if we could afford not to resort undemocratic methods when such methods are essential to preservation of the state to raise the question suggests the terrorism could indeed result in a constitutional constitutional dictatorship is a dangerous thing rossiter such governments are the result of necessity of the sheer of survival the greatest danger with such a form of government its related institutions and laws is that they can remain after crisis has these are not decisions that should be made by the president congress each time the crisis escalates rather we should think them carefully in advance in order to make prudent decisions one need only look at the haste and thoughtlessness with which we adopted the potentially dangerous usa patriot act most of republicans and democrats alike had earlier rejected to understand legislating in the aftershock of terrorism should be avoided our present emergency laws and regulations are a hodgepodge patchwork quilt they respond to precedents from past great crises that is wise but unfortunately these precedents do not contemplate protracted war on terrorism or an enemy unlike any we have congress has the power to determine whether it wants the equivalent of a constitutional dictator in the white house the way to be certain that we make that decision during a crisis to revise and codify our emergency laws now before fear and anger the aftermath of a possible attack might cause us to make decisions and too easily trade liberty for security in numerous as i write this column president bush has announced that he address the nation about his plans for restructuring the government fighting the war on terrorism

most important are not placed first or highlighted but each subject is gradually and sequentially so that an intent student is sure understand and note that each book has an abstract and a table of contents through these first to get an overall picture to gather read at least one chapter a week but to give yourself time reflect do not read more than one chapter a day always read footnotes they

and age if in the home or the office you need to write letter send an email create a marketing presentation or do spreadsheet most people turn to microsoft office as newer versions office have come out over the years we have seen tighter between the different applications making it quicker far easier simpler to transfer that spreadsheet you did with excel into microsoft word about six years ago domination of microsoft office so as there were several competing office software suites like lotus smartsuite that offered a real plus over microsoft why microsoft applied itself to catch up by adding more in its suite over the past few years microsoft office changed its look by including some revolutionary applications that users even able to dream about like schedule the first that was then replaced by outlook microsoft frontpage a website authoring tool microsoft photodraw to let corporate quickly edit touch up their pictures and many more microsoft xp should be the first angular stone of the net even if according to recent reports be less elaborated so what is new in this version of office is it better well where i come in as see many things are new and will change the way you work thanks to a smarter office suite to build best office version ever released microsoft has focused development efforts based on customer feedback following is breakdown of the different parts and what is new and few as well so let the review installing office xp is as easy as with the previous release being somewhat fast for such huge software the setup has a new look but is still built around the windows installer technology ensure a high level of administration when you launch it if you older office applications installed like word access microsoft office xp setup wizard will list those old applications offer you to remove them to offer it managers the flexibility need the office setup is entirely customizable and you can choose component of the suite you want or not to install but we regret process is so painful due to the new way you have to enable or components and their sub components installing the whole suite no more than minutes reboot included so it is instantaneous to deploy the suite microsoft office xp developers focused themselves on application security so corrupted files can be repaired automatically by the application avoiding need to contact technical support or internal support staff uninstall and reinstall the we installed office xp on both a clean system and an upgrade system had no problems installing office xp on either system the difference being that the upgrade system took longer to install program than the other clean system as overall new office one of the key microsoft office xp goals was to make the whole fit to most needs base on studies that show customers use than of the full potential of each microsoft software included the whole suite microsoft has further simplified things to make easier to use if ease of use was a key goal during the stage of the suite microsoft has also focused on compatibility way microsoft office xp keeps a high compatibility level with predecessor office some of the new features smart tags microsoft office smart tags are a set of buttons are shared across the office applications these buttons when the user needs them such as when a user makes an error in excel formula when word automatically corrects a action when a user pastes some data and gives the user the options need to change the given action or task panes office applications give you easy access to important tasks in a single integrated view from the task which appears on the right side of the screen you can searches open or start a new document view the contents of clipboard format their documents and presentations or even translation and template services via the web take word example when you open it the task pane will show several links open existing documents folders search files etc this view displays the contents of the clipboard or formatting options the text your mouse cursor is on this major new feature become soon unavoidable for every office users and thanks microsoft every application of the suite from outlook to contains the task paste options smart tags there was a time having a clipboard can contain several items at a glance was just a dream or was hard to get even when using some third party utility since office were introduced the dream really came microsoft office xp adds some cool new features to the paste feature new options allow you to decide whether they want paste their data as they originally copied it change the style that it fits the style of the document they are pasting the into or apply specific characteristics to the data based on autocorrect options smart tags this feature provides an mechanism for you to control and modify automatic behavior takes place within the office applications you can undo an correction choose to not have that correction take place in future or access the autocorrect options dialog box needing to search for it under the tools menu this is especially for novice users that usually fight office to know why they auto correct things that they want speech hey here it is microsoft office xp finally includes long awaited and promised speech feature unlike corel or lotus smartsuite the speech feature of office is included in the suite and use a third party speech software like viavoice or so the speech feature is based on the work of the belgium corporate lernout ensuring users have the most powerful dictating system recognition increases user productivity by traditional mouse and keyboard execution with voice commands is more natural than voice many managers had to dictate texts their secretary because they type letters on the road be able to create easily their own document themselves their voice with office xp you can dictate text make formatting changes and navigate menus using speech and commands this is classed as a very big new part of the office suite and thus we have added a special section in our review office document imaging now that photodraw included microsoft office xp a small but very cool new application has added it is the office document imaging applet this advantage of optical character recognition ocr enables you to scan documents view those documents reuse that text directly in their office applications combination with a scanner office xp lets you scan and use contained in your documents easily than with every separate ocr software that can be very complex to use it is a enhancement that adds value to the suite furthermore you locate their imaged documents at a later time using the full search capabilities built into microsoft office document streamlined user interface as with every new version office xp shows a new look and feel that improves experience and slightly dusts off applications this removing visually competing elements visually prioritizing on a page increasing letter spacing and word spacing for readability and defining foreground and background color to the most important elements to the document recovery microsoft word excel access and give you the option of saving their current files at the time error occurs in an application as a result you spend less recreating their documents spreadsheets databases application error crash ok like to totally eradicate crashes in office xp but instead they a smart system they should keep some enhancements stock for office in office xp the applications automatically report any errors that occur directly to microsoft the corporate it department this gives microsoft organizations the data needed to further diagnose and these errors as well as to provide you with direct access workarounds or other information on the smarter recovery repair and extract microsoft word and excel can invoke this repair and recovery functionality the event of an error or a failure to load a file you can invoke this functionality by choosing open and repair from the open dialog save my settings wizard microsoft has added to office a small utility always need right now this wizard saves your office application settings so you can easily reuse them on other computer or when reinstall your pc an enhancement for intensive office users that are lost when have their customized office applications in front of note that this was released as a free download for office users earlier in the microsoft office save my settings please note that these are only a few of the new features that been added to office to improve the productivity security and of use of internet orientation was it possible for microsoft to make more internet enabled the answer is definitely yes this release of office contains links to a myriad of templates sounds photos and animations located on the internet servers microsoft collaborating work forgotten since microsoft uses a msn service to offer users a remote storage space so users can save documents to a remote server and share them the first thing notice after installing the whole suite is regrettable absence of microsoft photodraw then before you working with this new suite have to activate it over internet or by phone to unlock it until you activate it be to launch components of the suite a limited number of times this feature which is a clear hassle for most users is intended to software piracy since you can activate the suite only on the computer what if you change your computer apparently have call microsoft to update your user profile we have to say that so no problems have arisen with our gold version after we activated over a month ago so it is a good microsoft office xp activation after word httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr

few years so what are challenges of bringing your very intimate music into these over the years discovered how to fit into the smallness of and i find that even in these big spaces when it gets to be the moment still what type of production elements will be in i feel like a nice balance always based in the music and my baby which is the piano that centers the whole thing but i to enhance the story around it what i really wanted to do was an experience that goes beyond the emotional experience you can musically and also get a growing up in new york did you get to msg for a lot for concerts there

have nassau coliseum then i remember some of my favorite boy bands edition or new kids on the block that was amazing never this one time i saw wu tang clan they came on stage and got the audience to sing and i thought gonna me one of these this is your first tour as a mom are you worried about how balance i lie been having some moments sometimes in life working mothers and working people there

source ascended esoteric clearpixelgif clearpixelgif the priory of sion robert in recent years a great deal of information has been published books like holy blood holy grail alleging that the holy grail refers to a bloodline descended from jesus by this account jesus mary magdalene produced offspring and their descendants gave rise the merovingian dynasty which ruled france from to ad intentioned readers and even authors have been deceived by this and have mistaken it for the revelation of a suppressed unfortunately the only thing that has been suppressed is the the grail is not a bloodline this false story originated in reams fraudulent documents created by an extreme french sect group responsible for these fictions calling itself the priory sion and claiming an ancient esoteric lineage has kept its authentic history carefully hidden how it constructed its fraud not been revealed it is long past time for the light of truth reveal the priory of sion and the fictional bloodline it has for what they are really are a fraud the background of this reveals its actual motives and sources of the trail to the priory of sion fraud begins france a resurgent interest in the occult to the creation of many esoteric groups members of these groups belonged to several organizations their leaders often broke away form competing factions at the same time constant turmoil in french government drew france into two increasingly hostile jousting for political supremacy the royalists composed of catholic church the far right and the supporters of the old system royalty vied for power with the republicans composed of and other supporters of democratically elected governments struggle affected the lives and views of every frenchman from the eve of the second world war freemasons dominated government their domination earned them bitter in the at the height of this political conflict alexandre st yves the supreme hermeticist of epoch proposed a new idea for injecting moral values governing society he called it synarchy and claimed it was method used by the knights templar to change medieval society an band of initiates would influence groups representing different of society those groups would influence their spheres and the entire social by the turn of the century the royalist faction came to fear whose influence had spread beyond esoteric groups by the masonic groups with distinctly synarchist policies were a reality france in the s even a leftist group called the advocated a technocracy with synarchist in this era the french far right formed its own seemingly groups but they were actually front organizations pretending to masonic and esoteric affiliations in order to draw support away the masons as spread across europe in the s french far right denounced masons and jews in the same breath fourteen initiatic orders created a federation called fudosi to peace and positive ideals the far right increased its formation during the war nazi occupation policy was to arrest leaders esoteric organizations put them in concentration camps and their records and membership rolls which were placed in central depository in france this depository was called the maconnique and the french occupation government at actively aided the gestapo in its persecution of masonic and orders so great was the far fear of masonic influence that unknown source even issued a document called the chauvin alleging masonic involvement in vichy while these events taking place the individuals who later formed the priory of were being gathered into two groups one group known to have been existence as early as was called alpha galates toward the end the s alpha galates utilized a young man named pierre born march as its titular in at the age of only seventeen plantard attempted to found and group to engage purifying and france and sought official permission to publish a periodical the renewal of france this theme would constantly appear association with alpha galates and later with the priory of by plantard headed a catholic youth group holding retreats brittany for teenagers and in was also noted as addressing gathering of catholic youth either plantard was precocious or he was carefully coached by older people including probable sponsor inside the church who arranged his engagements likely he made these connections through ties to the organization of alpha galates and through his own youthful at the parisian parish of st louis where he eventually its under the collaborationist vichy regime the group behind plantard alpha galates sought influence with the government on december plantard wrote to marshal petain head of the vichy denouncing a vast plot but he failed to receive attention beyond routine entries in police files in applied to found an organization called french national renewal was denied official permission in september of that year finally plantard and his superiors again sought public visibility openly using the name alpha galates and promoting a publication vaincre vaincre which commenced publication in september was filled fawningly articles and sprinkled with superficial esoterica on celtic traditions and chivalry alpha galates tried to present this journal as the clearinghouse of relatively sizable and cohesive body of young people after six it ceased publication but it earned plantard some recognition he periodically observed by the police as late as february police were still investigating alpha galates and its membership of or so and concluded it had no serious purpose but least one serious seeker robert amadou who joined alpha believing it was a genuine esoteric group suggests that its focus political later a freemason and martinist after years refused to discuss alpha galates only saying for my part i never been involved in political activity before or in while a revived fudosi met in paris pierre plantard filed legal papers necessary to create another organization called the academy its titular head was his own mother its ostensible was historical research its real purpose was to carry on program of its predecessor by the plantard promoting himself in catholic circles as the merovingian pretender the throne of france one place where he engaged in these was the paris church and seminary of st in plantard and others created a new group named the priory sion it had statutes remarkably similar to those of alpha galates published a magazine called circuit disinformation which eventually become widespread about the affair began to appear starting in the magazine la depeche de midi in with the french government in turmoil in plantard and his again sought political influence alleging that they controlled gaulle committees of public safety and articles in the newspaper le monde to imply a association between de gaulle and plantard any connection de gaulle and the eminences grises from whom the great this world seek counsel is unknown to de gaulles associates biographers but by new issues of circuit were trumpeting circuit shifted to a steady diet of superficial masonic and subjects flirting with mythology astrology and restructuring french government the unique but unspecified of pierre plantard and of course french national renewal they pointedly and proudly promoted back issues the book treasures of the world by robert charroux proved a success in france in mixture of mysticism mysteries and lost treasures and public interest in his recounting the mystery of gisors allowed the priory to launch itself public view claiming to be an inside source the priory alleged the lost underground chapel of st anne in gisors normandy either secret priory recordsor the lost treasure of the templars none of these fictions materialized but they gave priory the visibility to successfully promote itself and its history of france descendants of jesus and esoteric orders in and the real priory of sion was an authentic catholic monastic order priory is a religious house or order sion or zion is the ancient for jerusalem where the order was headquartered at the monastery our lady of mt zion it transferred its headquarters to st in palestine and later to sicily in it ceased to exist was absorbed into the jesuit orderit was never a seething cabal esoteric and political interests never had any influence over templars or any esoteric orders and does not exist today as legitimate order catholic or otherwise it has been appropriated many authentic histories esoteric traditions and orders to create false history in deference to the truth in the remainder of article i will refer to the false priory in two examples will quickly illustrate how the false priory has its fictions it has attempted to appropriate templar history portray the templars as subservient to it and to its bloodline through totally fabricated documents various authors the priory documents and by such claims as one that the familial of a templar grand master was at blanchefort near yet blanchefort was the home of a cathar noble by that name not templar grand master few researchers have bothered to this or innumerable other outright similarly plantard alleges his suppressed last name is st although no shred of proof supports this claim the originally st clair hereditary heads of scottish rite were related by marriage to templar founder hugh de payen in this the priory seeks to imply that it has an ancient and leading role masonry appropriating honored names associated with the esoteric is tactic used at the time of alpha galates by prewar the priory constructed its fiction of the bloodline of jesus by creating the appearance of an authentic esoteric lineage for itself accomplished this by placing fabricated histories in libraries falsely associating itself with ancient esoteric groups and usurping the heritage of prewar esoteric groups the group the has plagiarized most from is the order of the of the and the grail founded by josephin in this group is intimately connected with the real affair of some of its real and alleged links adopted by the include the work of the painter nicolas poussin emma a with numerous occult connections claimed associations with the vehm the knights templar and the survival of a supposedly monarchy association with prominent cultural sensationalistic announcements of the discovery of the tomb of the supposition of a higher esoteric order with supreme knowledge cathars and other themes appearing in priory inspired cure of from to have been associated with the order of the of the temple the grail this association is the source of the incomplete which the priory of sion has inherited about through the real founder count israel the actual priory history begins with that obscure man count israel monti secretary to josephin born in in and monti considered the priesthood entered the world of initiatic orders at age and became a scottish rite mason by he had rapidly advanced in order in he journeyed to egypt and in to munich on following death in monti appears as one desperately to be at ground zero of occult activities but always appearing as a supporting player with incomplete knowledge he craved recognition that he even affected the title count monti he began to tell melodramatic tales of his involvement in supposed political activities of esoteric orders although his known political connection was with daudet brother of the of the rightist group action francaise and in monti claimed an affiliation with the controversial magician aleister and his occult group and said he had been charged by occult groups england and germany to begin a new in the apprentice sought to become the master acted to fulfill these sweeping directives and formed a new according to occultist anne osmont he moved forward with a plan destroy all which is dear and precious to me to build an society together with a man calling himself gaston demengel using the name marcus vella formed a group calling itself occidental esoteriques a very small supposedly order this organization was highly secretive pretending to be elite body dedicated to bringing the world a lasting peace and having male and female branch the isis the extent of its and activities is unknown its only known document claimed as one its goals the reconciliation of esoteric orders with the church this goal as well as the pretensions of exclusivity and an alleged interest in world peace is echoed in the priory in october the bulletin des ateliers superieurs de la grande de la france the organ of the masonic grand lodge published a denouncing monti as a trafficker in information a fraudulent to nobility and a supposed jesuit agent on the st of the month monti was found dead close associate dr savoire rushed to examine him and claimed that monti had been savoire is mentioned in the first issues of alpha vaincre as one who along with plantard rightist louis le fur and maurice moncharville was responsible for creating vaincre in no of vaincre le fur writes that he was initiated into galates by georges monti in from until his death lived at rue du rocher in paris perhaps too coincidentally vaincre was printed down the street at rue du rocher by poirer murat whose name would surface after the war in with savoire had a long history of forming alternative esoteric while active in masonry savoire disagreed with masonic practices goals and leadership like monti savoire was a scottish rite mason in geneva in but by savoire had formed his own group the national grand lodge of in after the formation of alpha galates he formed interestingly named grand priory of the gauls he died in close association with monti and his involvement with orders makes savoire a likely candidate for assuming leadership of groupe occidental there are many associations between the activities of and monti and their associates on the one hand and the identified with the postwar priory of sion on the other it is likely that alpha galates was a front for group and group continued on subsequently implementing a plan would be carried out under the guise of the priory of the first objective is to position itself in the mind of unknowing public as the supreme western esoteric organization dreams of utilizing that constituency in a fashion promote its hybrid agenda of politics esoteric teachings it does not represent the teachings of any positive esoteric order it is materialistic with attaining influence and has fabricated documents without for any ethical considerations its program is to manipulate through lies in order to promote the bloodline created by the priory does not exist is no descent from jesus through the merovingians or other families fact there is no genuine evidence of any bloodline descended christ the survival of the merovingian bloodline as promulgated in priory documents is based on the alleged marriage of giselle de to the merovingian king dagobert il giselle de never existed plantard and his associates fabricated the fraudulent history of the priory of sion and its false was created by utilizing the vast amount of esoteric documents available in french libraries and by depositing its own documents them for example papers were deposited in the bibliotheque and papers were deposited in the sorbonne in by the son of the french occultist papus along with many own papers an investigation by researcher paul smith shown that some of the documents indicating a supposed bloodline and priory inspired poem called le serpent rouge were printed on same press during the war it is probable that the priory also access to the seized records of masonic and esoteric societies quite old which were deposited in the maconnique this depository was headed by henri coston journalist and collaborator who was quoted the first page of vaincre no similarly to create credibility with researchers the attached family tree to an authentic genealogy appearing in a special edition of the historical journal les cahiers no which was deposited in libraries other fabricated priory the concept of the phony bloodline originated in two places in s the writings and speeches of the italian esotericist julius received prominence in many philosophical esoteric and political circles and were admired by nazi leaders like himmler many priory themes originated in ideas to thinking in the old system of world order the king was believed to a sacred being divine virtues and powers descended on him institutions were based on sacred legacies the state itself had transcendent meaning evola also referred to a special quality of blood which he alleged once existed in one royal house above all admired godfrey of bouillon first latin ruler of palestine after first crusade as the ideal ruler the lux monarchorum light man could only be restored evola wrote by government of a spiritual elite those wearing the belt or cord initiates that marks the carriers of some invisible all these ideas permeate priory thought the priory documents require members to have a cord at to create the concept of the bloodline ideas were melded one other source the doctoral dissertation of walter johannes originally published in germany in in this work called ninth century world history in the light of the holy grail stein close associate of rudolf steiner detailed what he felt was historical and symbolic background behind the grail an appendix to the ninth century is a genealogical chart stein the grail bloodline one side extends into the royal house of another extends down to godfrey of bouillon part of thesis that events in the lives of actual historical figures served as for the characters and for some events in the grail stories to stein the people associated with this family tree were in their time as being of a high spiritual nature and having capacities yet he also stresses that these capacities had from this family hundreds of years an undisciplined reader of stein could easily confuse the persons with symbols intent is actually to illustrate how positive spiritual forces represented by the holy grail are manifested in the lives

vs ballgif crow and raven ballgif mythology and ballgif crow and raven ballgif recommended crows and birds of mystery and my love at my window like a raven with a broken bob the raven is big black and beautiful its highly glossed shows iridescent greens blues and purples shining like a dewdrop in the light and it dives and rolls like a black out of the sky or speeds along with liquid gliding strokes the is the paragon of the air and more it is assumed to be the brains the bird world so deep sonorous penetrating voice demands attention and respect even though we have little or no idea what says it has a greater variety of calls than perhaps any other in the world except human beings it is an imposing bernd if men had wings and bore black feathers few of them would be enough to be revhenry ward beecher mid bird welcome to crows and ravens or ode to the underdogs i underdogs because crows and ravens have been under harsh scrutiny long as anyone can remember and the dominant perception has been these animals deserved nothing close to sympathy but rather forms of persecution thus they were freely shot at and nests were destroyed and yet somehow these animals persevered are thriving in fact ironically crows ravens are probably much closer to the characterizations in heinrich quote above than to our traditional billythecgif cateyesgif ample press is given to charismatic animals such as dolphins and the like but few when talking of intelligent beings think mention the crow or raven it is however easy to understand natural aversions we have towards these birds lacking in type of beauty they have a cacophonous and incessant caw and are cunning thieves to boot a example of our perceptions from the baltimore sun dirty noisy pecking how this reputation became so engrained an obvious reason is the birds propensity to be toward carrion sometimes in large numbers and usually with in the winds but in the realm of death one deny the impact old world literature in forming our associations of death with pitch black birds bheinrich in ravens in winter cites examples in the old english poem judith the raven is seen at of battle with the wolves waiting for fresh kills the wolf in forest and the dark raven the bird both knew the warriors intended to provide for them a feast of doomed and behind them flew the eagle eager for prey and the one the one he sang a battle song the and with much likeness are these lines from beowulf an epic poem also from old england but the black raven eager for doomed ones as he shall say much to the eagle of what success he at feeding when he with the wolf plundered the corpses due to associations the word ravenstone became a term to refer to places besides the associations with death crows and particularly were also symbols of the ungodly and of ill repute if there was a in plan it must be these birds shakespeare shksperegif macbeth says the raven croaks the evil entrance and in othello raven flies the infected house both screaming connotations heinrich says that generally ravens came to be with sinner despite biblical assertions of ravens feeding hermits during a time of turmoil and drought in king message was depart from here and turn eastward hide yourself by brook cherith that is east of jordon you shall drink from the and i have commanded ravens to feed you however contrasting the dominantly dark perceptions of the old in the new world particularly the northwest portion natives held raven at least in a position of reverence creator of the sun the earth and inhabitants their stories claim which in part why the raven thrives in the they were not persecuted as the eastern settlers especially in alaska killing a raven is ultimate taboo that can yield nothing but harm to the assailant on lawrence island during an archeological excavation bones of different bird types were found notably absent were raven suggesting that this eskimo civilization of years has long the raven apparently the ravens even seem somewhat tame in such the raven always benign although it seems as one moves the more natives acknowledge the power as a trickster rascal believed that raven had to alter the original creation the world to a environment for humans so life too easy watching humans struggle with the complexities and arduous portions of life is a source of amusement for raven in the original creation raven had fat grow on trees and flowed in both directions and humans were made of durable stone than yet this trickster reputation may also stem from the sense of and play that both crows and ravens seemingly possess stories numerous citing examples of the birds playing catch with twigs down icy rocks on their backs provoking much larger animals by such as and i on a few occasions witnessed a pair of crows possibly ravens humans in seemed as play tactics or was in someway a manner to gauge response to such but here are my two favorite trickster anecdotes first a man doing some research on raven and was required by a superior to down a raven for some aspect of their research the man despite reservations for shooting an animal he was fond of reluctantly out his orders spotting a raven he fixed it in his scope and just skimming the wing he did not cause any serious harm and the unwavering continued to circle it circled around and proceeded drop a present with keen percision on the man consequently quite an impression on the he never another unless he was intending to eat it the second involves a man who had it with crows thought they were the reason why he cottontail rabbits he and his buddies often shot at them with success crows have an elaborate team protection so one he came up with the plan to scare them by placing large mirrors on ground facing up so that the crows would see their reflection thus be scared by their image well the birds being curious out the mirror then peculiarly one by one made a pass over mirrors dropping excretions pratically covering the entire they proceeded to go the roost and crowed like mad in understandably i can see why one may be hesitant to have a raven or crow as a friend while they may be smart protective adventurous and full of engaging play it seems issues could subvert the relationship i embracing anthropormorhisms prefer to see the birds as orientated i see them as flexible adaptive and curious birds incite intelligence i like how they seem to have a thirst knowledge always testing out new things for advantages and and i prefer to see the raven in the compassionate light as athapaskan people do dropping good fortune when it is needed deserved as from the book moose by michio hoshino sometimes call on the raven for help one of the things we say to raven while hunt is which means grandpa drop pack to me also from the book a woman claims people also talk raven when they see it out in the woods especially when they alone they talk to raven the same way we pray to while undeniable that crows and ravens are birds of surprisingly scientific study of these creatures is limited at although recent interest has spurred ravens understandably are a research subject they are witty secretive have large ranges and usually in mountainous terrain that is difficult to traverse crows everywhere yet subjected to obvious prejudices most just find them to be a charismatic research scientists however are starting to ackknowledge the intrigue crows as well as their experimental potential more and more and writings are surfacing from the scientific community on corvids

shapes cuts of diamonds for each diamond shape there is a set of critical angles that a diamond should be cut too in order to its brilliance fire and scintillation the closer the diamond is to these standards the more brilliant it will unfortunately cut is the most difficult aspect of diamond grading a layperson to understand yet it may play the greatest role in bright your diamond is diamonds that are cut poorly may look good in jewelry stores under high power halogen lights but they appear sleepy after they are exposed to poor lighting makeup and soap ideal cut diamonda properly cut diamond is a bit like a mirror reflective coating on the back of a mirror returns light so we are able to see through the mirror the critical angles of an ideal diamond combined with its highly refractive properties reflect in same in contrast envision a glass removed from a dishwasher with spots since there are no reflective properties we see through glass and the water spots are your diamond should be like the mirror a properly cut diamond reduce the effects of makeup lotion and hairspray on the back of this illustration represents round diamonds each having the mass we will refer to them each as carat in diamond return of light diamond heavily flawed crystaldiamond the first diamond larger than the others from the top view because it was cut wider shallow your first impression might be that that is a good because looks larger it is actually very detrimental to the appearance of stone this diamond is like the glass in the dish washer the will be less brilliant and unattractive when it is so why would someone choose to cut a stone this way the rough diamond may have been shallow in shape or perhaps part of rough was heavily flawed and the cutter chose to trim around diamond rough diamond crystal diamond the second diamond smaller than the others from the top view because it was cut and deeper here again the diamond lacks the brilliance of an cut diamond and it appears smaller than the other carat so why would someone choose to cut a stone this way a rough diamond usually a crystal octahedron and somewhat the cube would create a carat faceted diamond can be cut deep and chubby yield a diamond that is carat in weight an uneducated diamond looking for a carat diamond may believe he is getting a great after all the rough that this stone was cut from would have generated a carat stone so it will be priced significantly than the fine carat diamonds in the diamond diamond crystal cuttingdiamond the third stone is cut the ideal cut stone is faceted at angles that are calculated return the maximum amount of light to the viewer stones in this are visibly brighter than deep or shallow stones and are the bench for quality in diamonds so why would anyone cut it differently reason is that it takes a skilled diamond cutter to position in exactly the right position as with all vocations there are degrees of skill from one cutter to the next another reason would to cut the stone deeper or shallowly to optimize the profit increasing its weight or cutting around the undesirable in the to summarize cut has everything to do with how brilliant

demise has not only begun but is almost by his thinking humanity has plunged itself into the abyss of damnation destroyed its environment allowed itself to be led by the traders and high priests read

discovered that i had made business decisions during the last half of the and was deeply debt to the irs it was still percent tax time i was behind penalties and interest were burying me and i had no

device applies mechanical pressure to a chemically conditioned slurry is sandwiched between two tensioned belts by passing those through a serpentine of decreasing diameter rolls the machine actually be divided into three zones gravity zone where draining water is drained by gravity through a porous belt wedge where the solids are prepared for pressure application and zone where medium then high pressure is applied to the typically a belt filter press receives a slurry ranging from solids and produces a final product of cake solids depends on the nature of the solids being beakers belt filter

dilute high rate drainage technology developed for enhancing the higher production rates at higher thickened sludge solids of belt thickeners also has its application in the gravity section of belt press by creating more residence time in the gravity zone providing for greater drainage capabilities and higher concentrations at discharge other belt presses having standard systems cannot achieve equal production an independent gravity zone has the same capability as a gravity belt thickener and therefore has application on a sludge where the suspended solids are less than further a filter press may be designed as a combination unit in the thickening mode a doctor blade is at the discharge roll to remove thickened solids from the gravity in the dewatering mode the doctor blade is retracted to allow thickened sludge to enter the wedge the adjustable wedge provides a gradually applied increasing as the solids approach the first dewatering drum pressure is by the upper tensioned belt by moving the wedge zones entrance thereby reducing or eliminating solids migration beyond the belt which can occur on conventional press the pressure zone should begin with a large diameter perforated dewatering drum designed to remove a high volume of and prevent upset because of its large diameter large belt wrap and design the initial drum extracts more water from sludge at the inlet to the zone than does conventional press and because of its internal baffle design the rewetting of cake on the bottom half of the the use of this larger first drum and a succession of diameter drums gradually increases the pressure profile to a dewatering force a pressure drum profile up to a maximum of provides an extra long zone with more belt area contact with the dewatering drums and thus provides more time pressure for more thorough finally an extra long section provides more belt in contact with dewatering drums and thus provides more time pressure for more thorough belt filter the

flea saliva grass or pollen mold spores microscopic that live in bunnies or an ingredient in commercial dog pollen and dust granules are inhaled by dogs just as they are by owners but instead of producing sinus congestion and a sore they cause the skin to itch the hair to fall out and with scratching the eruption of pustules that often become infected a or two can add to the misery and if lad is allergic to something his diet as well watch out allergies can lead to stomach intestinal problems including vomiting and diarrhea and are accompanied by ear some breeds of dogs seem to be prone to development of allergies all dogs can be inhalant allergens are substances in the environment that cause the system to react as if invaded by a foreign body if all dogs reacted these substances they would not be allergens they would be these allergens cause mast cells in the skin and basophils white blood cells in the blood to release antibodies that histamines serotonin and leukotrienes these

environmental controls include frequent vacuuming and dusting of areas where the dog spends time and keeping his bedding some dogs may get relief from antihistamines such as benadryl clemastine tavist or chlorapheniramine but owners should ask their veterinarian for proper dosage for pet and may have to try more than one before finding the formula steroids such as prednisone interfere with the immune system so that the body no longer considers the allergens to be steroids should be used carefully and sparingly as they may cause problems and in older dogs can trigger a form of cushings steroids also increase appetite and thirst cause more urination and can increase aggression in some dogs however doses of predisone can be invaluable in treating a dog with chronic acute allergic reactions when all else dogs with allergies can scratch and bite themselves into infections that need treatment with antibiotics prednisone is prescribed for these dogs to get the itching under

brewers yeast to keep fleas but no evidence exists to prove these plant products are preventives other dog owners plant herbs such as southernwood or wormwood around dog kennels or near doorways and herbal flea collars brush lavendar or eucalyptus oil into the coat once a week or sprinkle dried leaves of lavendar rosemary or eucalyptus in the dogs bed to keep the little bloodsuckers at but the

suitable protein source may be mixed with rice potatoes create a hypoallergenic meal ackerman wrote in skin and problems in dogs the meal is prepared by mixing one part lamb or venison or other protein source to which the dog has never exposed with two parts rice potatoes all ingredients should served boiled and fed in the same total volume as the pets normal once cooked the meal can be packaged in individual portions and then thawed as needed this diet is not to be fed it not nutritionally balanced to be a regular diet it is only fed for or two months at a time as a test when trying to isolate a food allergen the dog must not get but the prescribed diet if the dog tolerates the food well and symptoms decline or disappear other foods can be reintroduced to determine which

http://www.cinematechnic.com/super_16mm/super-16.html cinematechnic o products o services o the super what is super o super is a relatively new film format that takes advantage of unused sound track area in mm film to increase image quality by to depending on the desired aspect o super was originally developed in sweden in as a means shoot low budget feature films for to mm in the cinema aspect the super format was developed by swedish cinematographer ericson beginning in ericson was looking for a way to feature films for mm exhibition with a lightweight mm camera was supported by the swedish film institute and the film filmteknik the first feature film shot in the super lyckliga skitar with ericson as the cinematographer began at the end of and was released in sweden in september story is covered in the june issue of american description of super simply put super is a variation of the original mm format increases the exposed negative image area by extending it over area of the film that was reserved for the optical soundtrack in standard mm format originally mm camera original film had perfs both sides because mm had become the preferred format for news gathering many mm cameras were equipped to shoot on striped film which had perfs on one side only because of this all mm cameras manufactured after could shoot single perf without any the soundtrack area could not be used for increasing the image size the resulting film was meant to be printed and show on a projector because this area was needed for the optical soundtrack the case of mm film that was optically printed onto film this was not a problem and the increased image area improved the quality of the resulting cameras for super when the super format was developed by ericson there were cameras designed to shoot it all super cameras before modified mm the first mm camera successfully converted to super was a npr subsequently an acl was converted eventually aaton the first camera manufacturer to offer super cameras aaton from the factory arri began offering special order super of the arriflex sr with the introduction of the aaton xtr in all aaton cameras were super ready from the factory arri did same with the introduction of the arriflex sr in today all mm cameras are super compatible all professional grade cameras can be converted to super with the exception of arriflex the need for super part the super format was originally devised to solve the problem of low quality of standad optical to mm prints all prints are exhibited in either the format europe or the aspect ratio format in the usa standard has aspect ratio when a mm is made from a negative less than half of the original negative image area transferred to a standard mm internegative due to the of cropping that is needed to convert the aspect ratio from by both making the image area larger and changing shape to aspect ratio super makes for much higher quality to improvement in quality with super the standard mm aperture is x giving an area of the super aperture is x giving an area of mm therefore super gives an total image area larger when the apertures are compared in their original aspect the difference becomes more dramatic when we compare standard and mm at the aspect ratio required for mm standard mm extracted image area for x mm super mm extracted image area for x increase in image area with super for diagram of standard and super exposed negative the need for super part two originally there was not much reason to shoot super for transfer the television aspect ratio was in the us ntsc the rest of the world this all changed with the coming of the format also referred to as the advanced television standard although there are several hd formats the most common p and i they all share a common aspect ratio referred to as native aspect ratio of is perfect fit for hd video standard ntsc television transmission referred to analog tv will go permantently off the air in february now the time to switch to the increase in image area transferred to video for film to transfer in going from standard to super is a standard mm hdtv transmitted area x mm area super mm hdtv trasmitted area x mm area increase in hdtv transmitted area with super the reason and not is the ideal format for origination for hd is because it is always preferable in a film to have some buffer zone around the frameline sometimes small specs emulsion build up on the edge of the aperture in the frameline causing a rough appearance to the frameline this problem does exist at the sides of the aperture also it is always preferable camera operators to have some area above the top frameline that visible in the viewfinder to know when the boom is close to the top image resolution super versus digital hdtv super is also a perfect fit for hdtv in terms of performance the highest resolution hd format is sf pixels because of the extremely high data rate generated by this severe digital filtering is used to limit the bandwidth of the signal before it is recorded to hdcam tape also because the ccd in these cameras is limited by the optical low pass filter response is zero at horizontal lines the highest resolution it is possible to record on hdcam tape is lines since the ccd response drops rapidly above lines not is lost because of the hdcam digital the sf cannot be transmitted by air or displayed by any the currently available consumer hdtv sets it must be converted i interlaced format for transmission this reduces the resolution by at least to no more than tv lines although does not affect the horizontal resolution in any event no available consumer hdtv set can display more than therefore the standard of resolution performance needed to that a film originated program material will appear just as sharp hdtv transmission as a i originated video program is an performance of at least response at x tv super easily meets and in fact far exceeds these requirements with the over year old eastman exr films such as and with modern prime lenses super mm film performance is response at tv lines vertical and mtf response at lines choose the new kodak vision t filmstock when you need high sharpness the mtf of this filmstock is at this tranlates to mtf at tv lines horizontal for super transfer to hd this is better than the sony f cinealta can when recording to hdcam techincal dissussion of super and hdtv super conversions for arri sr we offer super conversions optics for super information on which lenses will work in super super lens chart shows the equivalent focal lengths standard

design of the stingray the shooting brake is the definitive hot design concept of the ferrari just released an absolutely gorgeous shooting brake bmw been producing the hardtop z and z for years to consistently reviews mercedes is designing a shooting brake cls and even little guys like hyundai and their brethren have begun to shooting brake design to their vehicles this is all being done for reason the shooting brake is a design cross between a sedan and a coupe it provides the better functions of each vehicle with style to them both a sporty hatchback with a long low and traditionally featuring a lot of extra space for luggage passengers over its standard coupe competition so popular now in fact that revered and incredible team corvette decided to develop a shooting brake version the c at first thought the idea of a shooting brake corvette seems a blasphemous but in actuality the long and sweeping lines of the and side fenders lend themselves perfectly to the style so in fact the shooting brake callaway prototype may well be handsome than the c stingray of course at this point this is only a concept and a render has yet to get their hands on a c stingray because well let anybody get their hands on a c stingray callaway does plans to bring this custom model to build though the c shooting brake modification will be known as the callaway and will enter in to production if original demand is sufficient to qualify the production cost callaway is currently gauging by taking orders with a prediction that the final price will come under the callaway aerowagon modification will be achieved through a rear hatch constructed using proprietary resin molding process which will then be reinforced with carbon fiber components the build itself will be lightweight and strong and actually add structural integrity and rigidity to the chassis over stock callaway claims that the shooting brake will be capable speeds in excess of mph thanks to these structural upgrades production goes as planned the first c corvette stingray will be rolling out of the callaway shops at the end of this in time for christmas what do you think do you like the c shooting get

certainly exciting with the c stingray due out later this year most of the questions of the model have been answered one of the primary ones was pertaining to engine a naturally aspirated v designated lt putting out hp a person lucky enough to sit inside model of the c has spotted something though and they shared their find with the world via the forums the computer powered instrument panel set had all the standard functions one would expect and one very exciting one a person would not expect boost now the stingray corvette is going to be a naturally aspirated machine so it has no need for forced induction boost gauges the supercharged ls c zr has a need for boost gauges and features a set of ones that are suspiciously similar look to the digital ones currently in the computer these certainly be used for the base model the inclusion of in the computer system hints very heavily at a or maybe even turbocharged option down the even more interesting is that this is the first time such a has been spotted in the tft display this means that either lot of people missed this before or gm has already begun work putting a forced induction engine inside of the whatever the the fact that the computer is programmed for such a function that chevrolet has kept their mind open to such a function forward maybe one of these models showing right now is even hiding a primitive version of such a monster beneath its them letting such a thing out in the wild where the public might get a glimpse of it seems with the c stingray base model releasing later this year in both and convertible

the future gm unveils the corvette at the geneva auto with the geneva auto show coverage dominated by vehicles the lamborghini veneno and the ferrari la ferrari it seems like the first time in months the corvette c coverage has pushed away from the front page not a great thing but also not terrible as the beautiful stingray convertible will itself with its incredible looks and amazing construction in the leading up to its public competing with the supercars at an affordable price point been the corvette modus operandi and that continues with introduction of a droptop convertible to the c corvette the stingray convertible is a beautiful take on the corvette in large part because the visible changes are the stingray convertible features an automatic top available in different colors to match the taste will fold down underneath a solid body tonneau cover the top can operated automatically from the key fob as well as interior instrument panel and can be operated at speeds to the stingray convertible will feature the same hp and lt that will be outfitted in the hardtop corvette and the inclusion of design features means the vehicle will not see a major jump in curb weight typically droptop modification of a hardtop vehicle requires chassis which add several pounds and cut down on a performance numbers but the aluminum frame utilized in the c is already stiffer and pounds lighter than the c model and such the body requires no further stiffening and suspension to accommodate its this will equate to an almost identical ratio on convertible stingray as will be seen on the hardtop aesthetically two vehicles have minor differences the obvious one of course is versus the but the lines of the convertible top stark and similar to what chevrolet has implemented in the c coupe the only other noticeable change is the removal of the rear wheel air intake the roof itself will feature a glass rear window and will keep down unnecessary road noise with the inclusion of sound dampening in its fabric construction both the convertible corvette and the coupe corvette stingray will go on sale in late c corvette convertible will be available with either a automatic

stingray corvette stuck on two wheels against a rock face i can imagine the test driver got in some trouble with gm for the first c corvette stingray accident to occur on a public the first c corvette stingray accident to occur on a public according to a release from chevrolet spokesman monte doran corvette was involved in a accident while undergoing road testing his account of the accident goes like during evaluation the driver caught the inside tire caught the of the pavement during a tight corner leading to the thankfully no one was hurt the car received only minor damage no citations were a big time whoops for that tester when behind the wheel of a beautiful and expensive vehicle all of this being said thankful it was a minor accident and nobody was hurt also to see the corvette stingray in blue as it truly looks great in color the angle of prop against the rocks also gives a good look the carbon fiber targa so there it is the first corvette accident pour one out for poor

grammy aired during the grammy awards just two nights ago was a second gm ad an interesting concept flipping different vehicles with an onscreen swipe reminiscent of using an or other tablet the purpose of the commercial itself is to the various vehicles available in the gm for the the volt sonic impala and stingray c each segment feels like a cheap version of a real commercial and weaker the skateboarding sonic and the best of corvette in all it feels rather disjointed i can only imagine is equally intriguing to as many people as it that being said and me getting my inner don draper out of the incredible for one reason the first true televised corvette it does a great job showcasing the vehicle being chased by some sort of alien stingray the driver of vehicle looks suspiciously like tom noted corvette who has publicly stated obsession over his own actually be if not the actor was almost certainly chosen in attempt to relate to a large audience for less than actually hiring cruise the a success thanks in large part to corvette section but the tagline for the new marketing campaign familiar moving on from their failed chevy runs deep had some bright spots but would ultimately be considered a new tagline of find news roads feels more fitting gm moving forward it signifies a push to the new and is intended to draw in new customers for these vehicles there is problem with it though extreme similarity to the defunct find your own road motto gm has tried to actively itself from its failed saab experiment and moving back in direction may not be wise for the all in all great to see the c stingray grace the small screen wait for its own not hampered by existence of cheap graphics and a super version of the chevy sonic or whatever that was would be fantastic see something

the c corvette stingray hit the web and covetous just when the c corvette stingray seemed as though it could not more coveted than it is at current multiple sources have now renders of the c corvette stingray convertible following the first spy images of such a vehicle being tested the result of the top on the gorgeous and exciting c corvette stingray takes what already an incredible piece of automotive art and takes it one further i personally am absolutely floored by the look can only hold my breath with anticipation until the moment when personally may be able to own one of these long a staple of the corvette it was only a matter of time before c stingray was made available in a convertible option but seeing just how such a vehicle will look that time can not come soon gone are the b pillars which many had branded as being too thick bulky looking and in there place is a sleek machine the top is definitely a welcome addition to the c corvette the question then becomes however how such a drop top will vehicle performance the motors required for such an option certainly increase vehicle curb weight but how substantial an will be is unknown the coupe version features a carbon fiber targa that will be provide enhanced vehicle rigidity and stability when and whose carbon fiber construction also ensures that it is light weight a rise of pounds for the convertible would not be of the question and the loss of chassis rigidity will certainly lap times as well if this is the case the question for buyers then certainly becomes if the stylistic change is worth the in performance considering too that future z and zr versions almost certainly not be made available as convertibles and increase in price that the drop top will be accompanied by i have wonder how many of these will ultimately be sold the convertible was popular option for the c that was for sure so it does not likely that such an availability will hinder bottom line in what do you think should the corvette remain coupe only or is convertible a covetable change what if it were a automatic instead of soft that seems to be the option which would provide best of both worlds but also would be prohibitively

http://www.dcresource.com/reviews/sony/dsc_s85-review/ dcrp review sony by jeff keller dcrp originally posted tuesday june last updated friday october printer friendly i first got a taste of at a private show and with sony high up in a san francisco skyscraper like a magic slowly unfolding things got better and better as the presentation along at first i figured it was just an enhanced with black body hey it worked for but then the removed his thumb revealing mega pixels on the body wow first camera i they asked me how much do you think something like this would i hate questions like that i first thought of the only camera i could recall the olympus but too expensive figured so i guessed they replied we wish we could uh oh too low i guess i replied nope wrong they told me i believe it with all the features camera promised at a great price i figure be flying off shelves but does it live up to the sales pitch keep in the the has a very good bundle inside the box the mpixel mb memory infolithium battery and ac lens cap neck usb featuring mgi photosuite software and page there really much to comment here since the bundle is good only real negative in my mind is the memory stick proprietary at least in digital cameras format also mb is a bit small for a camera that takes such large like all of cameras and camcorders the s uses the battery this battery tells you how many minutes are left until battery dies the included battery will last for roughly minutes before needing a charge recharging the fm takes about additional kudos to sony for including a lens cap with updated the is indeed mac os x friendly though you must visit the setup menu and change the usb mode to once done the image capture app will launch when the camera connected under mac os i find manuals not very user friendly the layout organization needs work just like the one included with look and the is pretty traditional looking and should be easy to pick up and use the body is a mix of metal and and feels solidly constructed it is a bit bulky so expect keep it in your pants pocket the dimensions of the camera are x inches w x h x d and it weighs g lb loaded this is the same as the begin our tour with the front of the the carl lens looks familiar i think seen this one before on epson and toshiba cameras this lens has a focal range of mm which is equivalent to mm the lens is threaded and a number of filters and lenses are available from the flash has an effective range of the other item of note on the front is the af illuminator using focusing in low light situations just left of the the back of the is where most of the action is the lcd bright and fluid though it liked to collect thumb prints nose will be a problem for those of you who use your left eye with optical above the lcd is the info display most often found on top of cameras in the shot above it shows battery life shots aperture shutter speed and flash just right of that is the zoom control which is for thumb access to the right of the zoom control is the thumb which is also a button that is used for adjusting manual such as shutter speed aperture and exposure on the other side of the lcd info display find an viewfinder the size is just right and diopter correction our fellow below that find the switch which is use for menus basic camera functions as well this quick review shows the last shot below that find buttons lcd exposure spot focus ae at the lower right of the photo you can see under a rubber cover port for the ac adapter included with on the top of the camera find the mode wheel shutter button microphone and a shoe for an external i found the shutter release button to be a bit sensitive at accidentally took photos on several the flash shoe is cold and uses a proprietary flash sync port see on the side of the camera in a second you can use flash for sure not sure if any others the mode wheel which has the power switch below it has a notchy feeling a good thing and has the following scene full aperture shutter auto movie some further explanation on scene mode choose between twilight portrait and landscape camera picks the best settings for these situations i how you have go to to the setup mode to change this aperture priority you pick the aperture the camera picks appropriate shutter speed the choices range from f f and vary a bit depending on the focal range shutter priority exactly the opposite you choose the speed and the camera picks the correct aperture you can from a number of speeds ranging from sec full manual you choose both the shutter speed and aperture values available are the same as on this side of the camera you can see the speaker accessory for an external flash usb port and out port those last ports are kept under a sturdy plastic not much is happening on the other side of the camera memory stick slot down at the bottom of the camera with the battery that plastic door find the slot for the fm battery as well the memory stick the stick slot is so easy remove find a metal tripod mount down here as using the sony record the camera turns on with much fanfare and takes about four seconds get ready to take photos when you depress the shutter release halfway it can take up to a second to lock focus when you press button all the way down the photo is taken with no delay recycle is very quick on the s about two seconds which is considering the size of these images writing a tiff file considerably longer locking up the camera for nearly record the zoom controls were fine though the lens continued to move a after the button is the has a number of choices for image size and quality out this table which describes image size photos on mb memory standard quality fine x x x x the menu system is pretty simple since many functions buttons rather than menu choices take a look at the various items and what they white balance one push auto indoor iso auto image size x x x photo quality fine rec mode tiff text voice exposure bracketing normal more on this flash level high normal photo effects solarize black white sepia negative art sharpness to the one push white balance mode is indeed a manual wb mode shoot piece of white paper or whatever you want to be white and able to get accurate color in almost any more details on those rec mode tiff uncompressed large image only one fits on mb text records a gif in black voice records an audio file along with a still records a x image in addition to the recorded exposure bracketing three shots in a row with different compensation values this feature is new to the burst records three images continuously at a interval of sec there is no real continuous shooting mode on camera due to a lack of buffer in setup mode there are a number of other options available here the interesting scene mode selection twilight landscape moving image mpeg movie clipmotion explained digital zoom bracket step for auto bracketing reduction af illuminator file numbering series conversion lens lcd usb connect normal ptp put it in ptp mode for mac os x it took me many tries to get a good macro shot but i finally got sample you see above i tried manual iso and succeeded in aperture priority mode with manual white you can shoot as close as cm in or cm in full in macro mode on the the camera was about average in the nightshot test the color is a off on the lights though messing with white balance settings may helped and a bit dark of course so is the sf skyline aside from that there are no unnatural stars in the sky or the photo quality on the s was excellent with accurate color major chromatic aberrations and good sharpness take a look at photo gallery to judge for movie movie modes is one of the best out there the video and quality is very good and you can fill up the memory stick with in modes the only downside is that you cannot use the optical or digital during there are three sizes available in movie movie size of seconds on mb memory hq clips can be sec x x the quality is highest in hq mode but limited to second clips in the other modes you can record until the stick i finally have exciting sample movies to show you no more panning buildings or watching cars go by this time roller shot in mode seconds shot in mode have to turn your head to view this way it was intended seconds there is also a feature called clipmotion which will take images put them into an animated gif for playback the playback mode goes beyond the basic features found most cameras those include slideshows dpof print marking thumbnail mode and zoom these advanced features copy copies an resize change an divide splits movies in trim when zoomed into an image you can crop the image down the selected area you choose the resolution of the new image old one is the only thing to remember here is that if take a small area of an image and then blow it up image you can get more information about photos by zooming out twice get a scrollable list of information that you can see i also liked a delete button rather than having to invoke menu every time i want to remove a the s moves between images quickly in playback mode and it shows low res version before a high res one replaces it the shows up almost instantly with the high res arriving about seconds how does it what can i say the is the first megapixel camera priced the masses and excellent the photo quality features and are all standouts my major concern with many of cameras is memory stick format not a fan of proprietary storage formats to mention batteries but this probably bother most other quibbles include the underwhelming nightshots and lack of continuous shooting aside from that the sony gets enthusiastic what i million pixels for under feature very good photo very good bundle except for memory manual white great movie mode with what i care no zoom in movie proprietary memory stick external flash port and nightshots could be no true continuous shooting as of this writing the only other announced megapixel cameras are the casio olympus and toshiba as always i recommend a trip to your local camera store to try out and its competitors if there are any when there you photo so how does the photo quality stand up check out the sample photos our photo want a second opinion how about a check out digicams review of the if not enough imaging resource has one jeff welcomes your

out there in texas your letter a week ago and decided to return the blessing bliss sounds like a far out joint glad you like it in the middle of georgia got about six more weeks here go wherever they decide they want me gonna drive next weekend going to a bloodrock concert be your pal august rd sch bde ft gordon in those dark insecure days following the september th attacks remember the moment when a crack of light a little levity emerged however briefly the clear channel conglomerate published a list of songs best avoided by zillions of affiliates in the immediate wake of there were some that were apparently considered too amped barry eve of destruction too flippant another one bites the dust and to the outrage of everywhere simply too hopeful simon and bridge trouble as amusing as the list was i was thunderstruck note an incredible omission doa a heavy metal chronicle of an airplane aftermath is after all the supreme candidate for a tune i remember we were flying along and hit something the air laying here looking at the ceiling someone lays a across my chest and so on with shrieking sirens until last gruesome whew how could clear channel have omitted doa just because been forgotten for decades is no excuse no station has played of destruction since the johnson administration so the list more an aesthetic document than a real guide to censorship been permitted to play songs on a whim since reagan talk about lost always loved underdog bands and in such negative bloodrock is a major contender how underdog is bloodrock on funk box anthology the opening photo shows boys from flint embarking on yet another us standing proudly in front of a gfr jet surrounded by their crew whoops half of the shown is their openers hailing from fort worth texas bloodrock like grand funk railroad with whom they share an through being initially produced by the infamous knight was the year their canon was reissued bad timing dudes unless you happened to live belgrade the final year of the clinton administration completely lacking in the vital necessary for group who gave the world the ultimate death anthem no late would have been much think about it there was michael jackson lamely attempting fifth comeback promoting his latest performance to benefit survivors of the attacks sir paul mccartney was out his tribute some lame rocker in the classic lame manner was a reincarnation of that doggone girl is mine the best could was big and it demanded a big song eve of another one bites the dust even bridge over trouble water not bad but not nearly big enough the forbidden clear tunes fell woefully for my money a bloodrock reunion singing doa to benefit survivors of the attacks of course would have been hit tasteless disrespectful and vaguely sure exactly in the spirit of the song was when it charted the am dial in january only times more disrespectful and vaguely subversive all the better to keep up listen to a comment left on the mark prindle record review i loved doa in a really dark sick way when i was about never knew the name of that song so one day about two years i graduated high school and was bored out of my gourd i called fm radio station and asked the dj hey do you remember this about some dude who survived a plane crash it was kind of sexy said to him he said tell you what you are a sick to call and request that song that song should have been from the beginning and he hung up on me i felt kind of baked about two months later it occurred to me that maybe someone he had been on a plane flying low that hit something in the on the bloodrock fan site chris taylor son of guitarist nick taylor said on september i am not sure if i can listen to doa ever again without of the disturbing video of those planes hitting the wtc the recontextualization of doa via has already entered literature from clyde short story ground zero waking up van winkle i have decided that i am writing this article to satisfy curiosity did i somehow know that the attacks on the world center were going to happen this has been haunting me since tragedy i have never claimed to be a psychic or a clairvoyant have always chalked up all of my weird experiences to these weird and unexplained coincidences show up in the places and at the weirdest times in fact a reporter named frost was doing an article for an independent paper about my show to demonstrate how synchronicity haunts me i will give you piece of his article party at ground he explains that on the night he was at the studio doing interview i coincidentally chose a song to play on my show the was doa by bloodrock just minutes before airtime a small carrying some salt lake businessmen crashed in a blinding storm it crashed only blocks away from the radio station i on whether or not to play the song i played it because i had other song or prepared piece to fill the doa however was a bloodrock drummer rick cobb july told me i had to myself to some pretty vile tactics to evade the draft it was a rite of listening in to the dcrtv mailbag august the song doa was just wretched doa had no value for radio the listener that i can see other songs confronting death seasons in the sun wildfire and run joey run at least had good radio intro and arguably pleasant melodies for am radio doa the song was just sickening the instrumentals were to say the least it had stomach turning lyrics and an grotesque je ne sais quois filled the air when the song was goldmine magazine declared it the worst song ever to be put vinyl there is a lot of truth to their rating because the song become barely a footnote in the history of rock music if the doa was so reprehensible listen to it today you will agree why was it even played on the radio years ago you listeners would turn the dial not wanting to hear the song a time was it a or vietnam protest kind of henry c berkner recalls the era in his online memoirs the holy tracks and am radio my speakers strained out year i wore paisley shirts bell bottoms and wire rims remember being scared about vietnam scared about getting a lottery number scared about dying scared about living listening in to the message board of the bloodrock fan site i have a friend who was in and he was telling me that would get their albums sent to them then communications would some away so when they got bored they could listen to some rock in the stick well my friend tells me that they used to hook up pa system to some extra speakers and blast the song doa out to bush so as the viet cong come in at night he said sirens used to scare the crap out of them so they would crank it louder pretty strange i wonder who would be more frightened the soldiers who did understood the lyrics or the ones who did although dave famously broadcasted the sound of youth including doa from the airwaves of his pirate first termer in saigon the average bloodrock fan was about at the time of their doa fame the am hit version of the was popularized by the siblings of older brothers some of were serving in doa was a qualitative leap from all the previous am teen anthems because all sentimentality was absent bloodrock jim rutledge catalogs the sheet across my chest the numbness his arms the face as pale as it can be with dispassion of clinical shock the narration of the victim is businesslike as a black and white tv news report the very that described vietnam bloodrock lead guitarist lee pickens interviewed by roy long carl bratcher october recalled the origins of i had a friend die in a small plane crash right in front of my from there we the lyrics according to rutledge in a rolling stone where are they now feature were pretty tame to the original song blood and guts about throwing up and getting ripped off it was real doa is utterly blunt and remarkably simple the main motif bloodrock keyboardist steve hammond b appropriating ambulance siren with his melody hand and pounding a dirging chord bassline with his left real sirens are added at the top each verse the chorus introduces a strangely serene and bass drums and backing vocals to the famous last utterance remember we were flying along and hit something in the as creem magazine phrased it reviewing the bloodrock live album year later these guys out blacked the sabbaths and out funked grands with their monolithic vision of the future called all terrifying times call for terrifying tunes base story is the violence that the world has today mike clifford the harmony illustrated encyclopedia of shortly after their notorious and musically underdeveloped top hit they started to get artistic with their particular brand unpatriotic nihilism the heavy metal thunder of their first began to branch out and extend perverse little shoots of jazz listening prog and pop these guys got to be good players within year of constant touring and subsequently produced cult bloodrock their first notable lp cashed in on the notoriety the earlier doa earning them a large receptive audience record was briefly seller the lp designed by knight remains a pop art milestone spelled out with an american flag font a top stripe of blue white stars a second stripe of white and finally a third of red only blood dripping off the that alone spoke volumes about yet there was more rollicking hammond b and les boogie with a dash of the real easy rider stuff with tambourine weird unfinished ballads too and importantly breach of lease a minute anthem of apocalypse somewhere between the crazy world of arthur brown pink floyd a quiet walking bass supported by organ morphs into a brontosaurus riff while singer jim growls the lord has promised all his children he was gonna back his world someday man has disobeyed his leader man sorely breached his lease whoo did someone just blow out the candle only aphrodites truly satanic topped what was the effect of those anthems of total apocalypse children say with brothers in vietnam who were waiting for turn to fill their boots recall that american dripping with blood and it becomes obvious that bloodrock the ears of the lumpenproletariat one basement room at time was doing more for the mass movement than any alan chanted next up comes early and fresh from severing their ties knight and his cheapo cleveland sound bloodrock delivers smashing masterpiece bloodrock usa here we have grand band answering the back in the usa unbelievably enough surpassing while the big names of the age were either downshifting with exile on main street or piling up lushness dark side of moon bloodrock came out swinging with a diamond sharp sound tightly coiled arrangements if bloodrock was recorded in foggy murk of closing time and much of it sounds like it bloodrock usa was recorded in the full glare of high noon actually one of the best productions of the entire bloodrock usa starts off with the majestic pop of a sad too many people have died without reason the peak line a somewhere between jethro tull and side three of the white asked about the song writer and future bloodrock vocalist ham surmised july the tune was probably indirectly vietnam and other issues of the the lp races into a set of stadium new wave pickens possessed same burnished fluidity displayed later by the elliot the best of which is abracadaver feeling good but looking the set finishes off with a menacing blues riders on the storm with carlos castaneda a ripping good the sound and the tunes harmonized brilliantly with their lp cover a comic book illustration of mephistopheles enveloping the capitol on the jacket back his long reptilian hand turning into gun all the better to blast the plasma out of his hapless head on the jacket splat another amazing reads the caption drawn by john lockart who the year contributed illustrations to abbie steal this so harmonious was the art and music that the track american is a description of the cover it really a tight album just all the ways all the different ways learned that you can get shafted said rutledge in creem april primary complaint throughout that concerns their recording company which suggests the cover much about the us government eg the us capitol as it with capitol records which once included the us capitol in picture bloodrock ad detail in billboard magazine the point works both ways plenty of reason to whether all the members of bloodrock were raising the flag of left or simply acting out in the indomitable spirit of rock roll they came from texas after all rutledge went on to make bundle in the oil industry and pickens went on to found a car business claiming once to be a slave to the government a code however the defining consciousness of the vietnam embraced a current common to left and elements the left wanted freedom freedom to conspire against under cover of popular dissent while the right also freedom freedom from dying in a war which was beginning jeopardize capitalism vietnam promoted an uneasy alliance freak and redneck an axis of left and right this phenomena explains why country joe types hate to hear classics of the vietnam era reanimated for modern consumption opposing the iraq vietnam was unpopular with the masses not because of any sympathy for the nlf or any principled stand against war or forbid imperialism but simply because us boys psyched to have their intestines exploded everything is commendable even when the killing is done by a volunteer looking at particular brand of unpatriotic nihilism much matter if they knew or know what sort of they were tapping into with doa and later the cultural manifestation of society is erected by and reflects material basis supporting society but that mean it understands why doing so reinforcement theory get reward for leaning in one direction and sure enough another in the same direction follows bloodrock create the they were merely a fascinating display of the however there is indication some of the members of bloodrock raising the flag of the left which brings us to their last lp passage reviled amongst heavy bloodrock fans because and pickens dropped out to be replaced by the crooning warren and a general sound shift towards late left credentials are provided by two songs the liberal thank daniel ellsberg which earned the band an entry in lee book battle notes music of the vietnam war right with john lennon and pete seeger and the marxist the in a labor army working for the power put here at the prime evil hour but the means they plus the lennonesque hippie ballad which the record help is on the way which is nothing short gorgeous however and from there commercial oblivion breakup backup gigs doa was a commercial success said bassist ed grundy in rolling stone where are they now but it most wonderful music to play i have mixed emotions about career he continues on one hand people go you got live the american but it was really like being in the with no benefits when you get through and no training to help you everyday although keyboardist steve hill disdained doa in the past admits it remains a benchmark of success as he said to me capitol wanted a sequel to doa and if we could have that song our careers our commercial arc would have gone up totally painted ourselves in a corner with doa i had no of how to write a song that is the same yet different and i that speaks well of the bloodrock briefly reemerged in when the specialty one way began pressing their onto a transpired by three out of six members in some saloon a fan convention then back to the silence of the too bad timing and a little bravado is everything in the biz bloodrock or one way wanted a real splash they should recontracted with knight that alone would have been news being the cynical sharpie that he is would have no doubt recommended a marketing strategy as lurid as exploiting fame and fortune they could have even resurrected their ad one of graphics for the group which featured bullseye on the center of a us why the hell not who rose above exploiting for fame fortune certainly not michael jackson certainly not sir paul certainly not that snake oil salesman who calls himself president take all you can your turn

feldhaubitze mm secure a great new job click mm the fh was a towed howitzer designed as a close support weapon by britain germany and italy and was an early example weapon design for nato forces developed jointly by british west german and italian armed forces in a cooperative the fh was a counterpart of the us m towed howitzer was placed in production in at rock island il by the us armament materiel readiness command designed to enable nato forces to use the mm round which was of disrupting massed armored formations the gun was normally into action but in emergencies can use a small gasoline engine on the gun to move short distances on the battlefield this howitzer was capable of moving itself by an auxiliary power unit firing a shell to a maximum range of about km the and accuracy were good however irt was dangerous to manuver on ground and almost impossible to drive onto gun platforms in the vickers shipbuilding and engineering ltd vsel has over experience in the design and manufacturer of medium and large artillery systems they manufactured the fh with more than service with six armies worldwide the fh is a mm towed developed as a joint venture between vsel rheinmetall of germany oto melara of italy in the s vsel is not currently the gun but could reactivate production in response to an order it in service with the british army and many other countries and is still being manufactured under licence in japan further orders are not in september formal acceptance and approval of the mm field howitzer fh was agreed with the british german and partners main production began in and the system was expected to enter service about the end of the decade development of the version the sp major artillery development effort involves mm howitzers ammunition a mm field artillery ballistics development of understanding between the us and the trilateral countries kingdom germany italy was signed in march all new us trilateral ammunition is in agreement with it the new trilateral howitzer and its associated ammunition and the us m assisted projectile and improved conventional projectiles would soon be fielded they should be compatible test programs on the compatibility of new projectiles and charges have been exchanged between the us and trilateral they are being reviewed nationally to eliminate duplication tests the united propelling charges and the rocket projectiles will begin in if charges were the projectile and the m propelling developed at the us army armament research and development arradcom under management of the office ofthe project manager cannon artillery weapon systems were fired from fh towed howitzer uniform test procedures mm ammunition were developed and adopted in as a separate demonstration tests and trials by the four nations as well all other members of the nato planning to deploy mm weapons no longer be necessary results of tests conducted by one nato would be accepted by the other members therefore while some members were planning to field the fh and others the m ammunition and testing procedures would be the medium gun was first introduced into service with british army in it remained in service with some

negotiations for development on the basis of collaboration the fh entered service with the royal artillery december first delivered to the british army in howitzer was in service with two british regiments and was also by japan in it was decided that two ta royal artillery were to be equipped with the mm fh towed the trinational mou with germany and italy for fh which was in covered the development evaluation and production of a mm howitzer and its ammunitioncomprising the l he shell and primers the mou allocated work between the three giving responsibility for production of primers to rheinmetall germany in fact there was no alternative source of supply for primers stocks of the same mm ammunition were also purchased use with the m gun and there was no differentiation in the of mm ammunition between that originally procured for the fh m deliveries of fh ammunition began in and procurement of kinds continued into the s the allocation of work on the program was governed by a

given rise to years of work in this instance the product had to come from the factory over three quarters of the ammunition planned for delivery was delivered in in accordance with obligations the majority of this order was placed with germany the remainder in the united the fh howitzer in united kingdom service had no nuclear role and not intended to be a nuclear delivery system although the w
