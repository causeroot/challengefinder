france tjugofyra pida sweden bathing crystal germany recon pida france ama sa pida france special design report simplify surprise synergize lars wallentin lars wallentin a youngster in his seventies and a pida jury veteran devoted a near year career to packaging design in an position at and as an advisor to other fmcg he generous with advice to young designers often in the form of simplify and amplify do it big or stay in bed surprise and synergize and so on make it simple they are not phrases backed up by lars knowledge and experience they carry a lot meaning one of his main messages is that of simplifcation you have make it simple because the consumer is not receptive to a load information lars explains the consumer acts in fractions of a there is no time for complexity the aspect of packaging design interests me most is how a package the impact and there is only one thing to aim for and that is best in category of the time best in category turns out to be strong simple and a visual message on the front panel surprise the shopper element of surprise can help a pack stand out in the crowd lars out everybody wants to be surprised or entertained if you do unexpected the consumer may reward you with a smile or a glance sometimes that is all it takes lars counts a couple of why so many packages do not communicate effciently enough one is that designs go straight from the computer to the shelves standing the necessary trial in a store package has to work in a context another reason is how companies to take advantage of synergies look for synergies you have to total packaging and understand synergies lars says in all my years this business i have never been in a meeting where the designer the creative director of the advertising agency the owner product manager packaging engineer retail specialist and advisor have been gathered in the same room small wonder we coherent communication a problem relating to this is the tendency design the display material to do the same job as the pack displays just need to send one single signal hey look at this instead they are cluttered with logos it seems that the fear of wrong is bigger than the will to do whats right the favourite material such as cartonboard and paper has long been favourite because it is versatile practical light and acceptable the public attitude towards paperboard is very good material is recyclable biodegradable and is derived a renewable source born in the swedish forest the cardboard and also the paper have become my favourites for the simple reason that products the key to success in packaging design according to wallentin is to think about the package in its context and make easy for the consumer to buy the right special design report i have dealt with are mostly packed in this frozen food chocolate breakfast cereals pet food and so on decathlon of packaging design in lars opinion this is also initiatives such as pida are important is doing a good job it making a lot of material available to the students letting work in volume using cartonboard getting to know the material projects are real jobs too with a real brief what comes out is and imaginative very interesting not always feasible for production though because the projects are often too elaborate on the communication side the students generally have some ground cover yet but its like an old friend of mine in england says packaging design were in the olympics it would be like have to master several disciplines that takes time there is visit lars wallentins website httpaddr a resident switzerland lars wallentin spends his time writing and speaking communication in packaging fmcg fast moving consumer goods special pida design report blackmail got their careers started became of the previous winners the brief for pida was what packaging be like ten years from now you can approach this in a number of ways by imagining how technology materials or behaviour will change or you can do like pida winners martinez and adrien rambaud just imagine what the world will be ten years from now and take it from there our view of the future not very optimistic says rudy we pictured the future as selfsh and struggling companies in countries would not be able rely on charity for their survival but with some help they may able to help themselves support for fair trade rudy and adrien a packaging concept for fair trade coffee the pack was a envelope designed to hold a coffee sample and intended to be sent prospective sales outlets the pack holding the sample and a was then easily converted into a dispensing unit you just put it over cup poured boiling water through it and the sample would then ready to be tasted the pack came with a special pen that wrote on black surface plus a mailing list for fair trade shops likely to take potential interest in the product the project was called blackmail fair trade and the colour alone gave it a high impact the black was made to stand out in the mail to achieve this deep black you a print surface says rudy you can get intense black when printing colour black on white a to a problem we didnt win because we had the neatest design or we had come up with an advanced solution but because had identifed a problem that we could present a solution to says it was also a project that sided with the small giving them better odds to survive and saving their business middlemen and big corporations it refected a wish to make difference the jurys decision in awarding the frst prize unanimous rudy and adrien won a trip to sweden that included a to the mill and forests first of all says rudy we pleased to be offered the opportunity i was amazed by the sheer of it all the impressive production plant how they created their energy and how they managed the sourcing of their raw materials could see how the ethics of our packaging project ft right in to the environment and to sustainability it like we shared the same values the winners of pida france back as a team pitching creative packaging solutions to the entertainment industry just as when they started out with and coffee a winning concept is still the thing that saves special pida design report a proactive approach rudy is head of concept design at in london a solutions provider in home entertainment and media packaging such as video games and flms clients include sony and disney the agi and shorewood merger the business focus has extended encompass luxury brands in cosmetics and beverages as well professional role is to work on a strategic level helping our reps create packaging concepts that we can pitch to clients explains we take a proactive approach its our business come up with ideas its fun but also a great challenge when i got job one of my frst tasks was to recruit a new member to the team took me less than two minutes to decide on who to ask adrien of course my old mate from the pida project thats how we are colleagues today packaging in ten years time preconditions will become much more important even the french have to this capitalism and will increase and no one can do thing about it the environment will be the biggest topic other than sex food music and politics and fair has to change its concept otherwise producers of cacao rice bananas and coffee will be even poorer than they today rudy martinez and adrien rambaud special pida report bringing music to print dreyer dreyer deals quality enhancement in creative design they make a range of dies supply foil effects and offer services and in fnishing and exclusive printed decoration the result is visual that triggers special pida design report in the corner of greater copenhagen is one europes leading manufacturers of hot foil stamping and embossing of the business comes from outside denmark the future bright the general interest in graphic fnishing has grown the last couple of years says conni dreyer managing director dreyer there is no doubt about that at the same time challenges are getting bigger customers are looking to new and technical opportunities yet also focus more on price the attention is weighed against cost paperback covers on the rise growing market segment for dreyer is book covers and especially in the german book market clients are very innovative committed dreyer says the embossing foiling of the typography is often the main visual of the cover and they work in colours all that glitters is not gold a growing awareness of when it comes to print enhancement of book covers and luxury what trends and developments can be observed first of all there is growing awareness of quality says dreyer an improved of effect and of design as an aspect of the essence of a brand designers are asked to take a greater interest in the life and soul a brand and bring more creativity and innovation into their as a result of the demand for enhanced quality there is also a for knowledge transfer and consultancy services in several italian packaging projects we have been involved very early on in process to advise on what fnishing techniques to use for realising designers intentions the trumpet fanfare graphic fnishing is not it is a marketing tool this is something that wants to emphasise it takes the consumer less than three seconds choose what to pick from the shelf the choice is emotional and impulsive does it look good do i like it will it do as a can i have it at home on display graphic fnishing is an of the potential attention of a package at the point of purchase like a trumpet fanfare accompaniment to the product hot foil music to the print the materials we have worked with proved to have properties that make them very suitable for fnishing techniques we have done some very fne embossings in white and we are now putting new artisan to the test and looks quite promising conni dreyer dreyer pida design report pida was a reality check at university what of the previous winners karin took the packaging programme at nackademin where pida features in as an integral part the course she appreciated the nature of pida it was frst real challenge karin says a real project in the sense that had a real job to do following a real brief coming up with results that could be used for real products we enjoyed working cartonboard because the task was always practical a good thing pida is the opportunity to show projects to and get chance to make an impression on people who matter solution for days the challenge for pida was to design a package with a life an additional use for the package karins team created packaging concept they called sunbreeze a curiously shaped package sunscreen after use the package was easily turned into a fan concept was cute practical and inventive and it sense too the two things can be used together a very event in the process we tried several possible routes karin it took us some time to decide what we wanted to do we wanted to something entirely different from what other teams were up to our brainstormings all kinds of ideas came up most of them something to do with summer eventually we focused on sunscreen our sketches to processing in the cad program and fnalised the in the pida event with prize ceremony was held at the where the paperboard product white is i amazed at the event karin says everything was organised and the place was full of professionals from the industry took a serious interest in us and our projects and they had managed fnd some really keynote speakers like the man from spencer who told us about their programme for sustainability but best thing was our sunbreeze winning the frst prize landed a job i can hardly imagine a better prize than a trip to barcelona my favourite city i have been there many times and have even there for a time its the perfect destination really so much to do much to see lots of art and architecture when we got there we very well received by luis hernando he had a full days for us answered all our questions took us to lunch and arranged for visit to an art school karin was part of the team that pida sweden and won a trip to barcelona in her current job as packaging technician she can look back at pida as a useful in her special pida design report karin works as a technician for orifame an international in the cosmetics and health beauty market the job means problems of design function and user friendliness as a technician i have a lot of different things on my plate packs bottles printing features and so on if i have professional use for my experience from pida well i am very and with white as a material because packaging very complex the course could not provide knowledge of materials but we got a lot of practical experience of cartonboard team behind sunbreeze comprised karin kristoffer linn sofa carlsson and monica persson special design report pida has developed into a national event pida what you find significant for pida the silent salesman it was interesting to think about the role of the packaging itself a pack not that silent it speaks for itself thanks to its shape and the students had to think about the impact of the pack in terms marketing but also about how to protect it effciently these are really and connected with what the industry looking for at the moment can you comment on your own projects the project was very original and creative students have understood that today we need individual packaging seduce the consumers while at the same time we must also give something like a friendly moment their pack translates problematics very cleverly how would you say that pida has since the pida france competition started locally at packaging science department of the iut of reims and then thanks to success quickly developed into a national event the competition been extended to other schools like the esiec and the esereims this stimulating and challenging for our school the event is with specialised conferences about packaging design and the presentations of their projects its always a very nice day because enables professionals students and teachers specialised in that to meet and exchange views and opinions about design how does pida into the university courses at iut pida is part of our programme the students work on it for fve or six weeks and then their projects to a jury composed of our teachers and designers get a mark that counts for the bsc degree pida makes the students cartonboard differently then and i think that matters a lot for future jobs the iut of reims is a technical university institute year to year our degree is vocational and we are asked to students fnd a job after their bsc licence professionnelle et design de our training course is very short and from october to february and offers modules in design creativity packaging processes and printing techniques quickly apply what they have learned on projects for companies ex designing a pack for a champagne the course followed by a business placement mainly in big and communication agencies in paris twenty out of thirty students jobs shortly after graduation is responsible for the degree in packaging design at the iut of reims and has

by moe stephens general council in case you heard the united states just finished a significant process election time for me always comes with emotions of excitement for potential change or fear of the same as university administrator all of the election coverage also got me think about the election process for fraternities and sororities north america many of you are electing new executive boards and be feeling many of the same emotions i described if you are running for or have recently been elected president your chapter the task before you is likely intimidating exciting full of the i must preface the following with the realization that i am by no an expert in fraternity and sorority life i am well versed and many experiences in this area but it is such a dynamic that i believe you are the experts because you are living that being said i often meet with new presidents and i provide following communicate authentically there are so many different groups a chapter president must communicate with it can be hard remember whom you have brought into the loop if you are what i call authentic communication it matter everyone are bringing to the table will have the same information it require you to be honest with both yourself and your authentic communication is not always the easiest course of action i guarantee you it will only help when the fecal matter hits oscillating device the more trust you have developed with your constituent groups the easier it will be to work through the before you are now living in the fishbowl the phi delta theta chapter the university of washington has a large glassed in dining area call the fishbowl the sidewalk and street right outside are travelled with students and community members passing by the eats there holds social events there and often has special in the fishbowl i have always thought it was great that the could see into the daily life of a phi delt at uw however i also thought about how difficult that might be at times the chapter does in that room is visible and anyone passing by draw their own conclusions about what is happening as a president you are now living in that fishbowl your actions and are being seen and heard often by people you are not even aware watching and listening you are setting an example for your and broadcasting a message to the rest of your community make sure is the right example be certain it is the right make good choices i often end meetings with the phrase make choices outside of the context of sorority and fraternity life simple phrase is much more difficult and open to interpretation as member of a fraternity or sorority it is actually very simple and live the ritual of your organization within your ritual values that are relevant and have withstood the changing times as ed king stated in his classic piece the secret thoughts of because i am a system of values i am therefore an instrument of evaluation my values are clear and absolute and yet difficult emulate to state a few i am honor courage integrity courtesy and i demand self control as well as ambition and what your founders did is take the idea of friendship and move it significant step forward to the concept of commitment as fraternity and sorority advisor i do not think you are going to perfect however i do expect that you and your chapter members about the values of your organization and use them to guide decisions imagine how much easier it would be to make decisions as executive board if you consistently asked the simple question does this align with friendship sound learning or own it you must be willing to accept responsibility for the of your chapter both past and present noted entrepreneur and jim rohn once said you must take personal responsibility you

a fraternity since our founding years the first the first convention was held just three short years after the of phi delta theta when seven phis met on december at woodruff house in cincinnati at the time there were only chapters in the fraternity while that first convention was different in size and scope from the one we will soon experience purpose was the same to discuss the state of our brotherhood and its from walter b authoritative account the history of delta theta we know that the first convention was conceived in when founder john mcmillan wilson miami wrote to robert morrison miami what can be done as to holding a at say cincinnati next christmas holidays or what do you advise the matter the suggestion was carried out when in november wilson wrote to morrison who was in

louis as an phi i am pleased to tell you about some customs and traditions that hope you will experience when we gather in washington dc which you to the experiences of previous convention attendees these listed in no particular order or customs and traditions which link us to the convention many decades ago members who attended the general convention the practice of wearing small silver bars to designate the number conventions they had attended these bars when linked resemble ladders as phis attend more conventions the lengthen and provide striking evidence of a phis devotion to fraternity each bar indicates the city and year in which convention took place the phi who has attended the most conventions and has the longest ladder in fraternity history executive vice president emeritus robert j miller new mexico brother miller served as the chief executive for before retiring as executive vice president in in dc brother miller will secure his rd ladder since he has every convention since the centennial convention in while at the convention be sure to take a close look at ladder if asked i bet he may even share a story or two past william morrison great grandson of morrison and robert morrison westminster grandson of morrison visit with robert j miller new mexico who displaying the longest convention ladder in phi delta theta history the convention in opening business

clubs and general officers of the fraternity the roll call conducted by executive vice president robert a biggs georgia and it is always impressive to hear how widespread the is across north america it is especially moving for many when biggs introduces a new phi delta theta chapter to the convention the introduction please welcome to their first biennial name of chapter or a reinstalled chapter with the please welcome back to the fold name of introductions are always special for those undergraduates and who worked especially hard during the biennium to be assist chartering a new chapter and are usually acknowledged enthusiastic executive vice president robert a biggs georgia southern conducts the roll call during the first business session of the convention in memorial one of the most solemn events which takes place during the convention is the conducting of the ritualistic ceremony the ceremony which is open to as well and by many family members and surviving spouses acknowledges

home chapter while serving an international posted on may by by rich fabritius general my phi delt experience has been filled by the presence of so tremendous volunteers many of them have never gotten a mention in scroll or during a convention but they work hard for our men and alumni brothers day after day been asked to write a fraternity volunteer enriched my experience and my life general my variety of great experiences with many a phi volunteer makes it difficult to comment on one my first contact with the general fraternity was through my president when i was an undergraduate brother george porosky with mercedes benz parked in the street across from the chapter house parking lights on he was a consistent positive presence in chapter patient and ever in control george steered us when we it and let us go when we needed to learn a lesson he hated chapter meetings he thought they were too long an engineer so think some of our ridiculousness was in firm contrast to constitution those meetings were long very long he was right course but they were fun and i remember thinking there was no place on the planet rather be than down in the chapter room sunday nights george is a main figure in my memory of but the volunteer who taught me perhaps my most treasured lesson phi delta theta is brother jim warner jim succeeded george province president of sigma south and prowls the sidelines of ohio for us to this day jim was an adviser at akron with ohio his alma mater just like george when i first met him i was undergraduate and remember meeting him at a kent state now there is a rivalry between akron and kent both and between our chapters so i was a tad perplexed by the presence an at a kent homecoming but when i met jim i quickly that he care about what chapter you were from he about you and he cared about phi delta theta i learned from jim lesson that has led me to this position today on the general i learned that phi delt just about your home chapter and a whole lot more than that i learned that phi delt is international brotherhood not a chapter i learned that you can your home chapter while serving an international brotherhood learned that phi delt is a whole lot bigger than kent university and make no mistake about it i love kent state and never be able to repay jim for the gift he gave me he planted me a curiosity about the larger organization i developed a thirst know our brotherhood beyond the buildings of kent ohio curiosity lead me to intern at the general headquarters which lead employment on the ghq staff while working for ghq i met my wife this day gift returns to me daily i imagine life without phi delta theta i imagine my experience without the deep gratifying experiences had the general fraternity and i imagine being a phi without as my brother mentor and thanks brother fabritius is the general council reporter his other service to phi delt has included education commissioner and president rich lives in atlanta with his

warner kent state phi delta theta fabritius volunteerism leave a comment do i know when a chapter is living the ritual a mom tells posted on march by by scott as phi delta theta helps observe national ritual celebration week i asked to share some thoughts on what it means to live the ritual realize that from time to time i am asked by administrators parents alumni and undergraduate members to give definitive definition of how i know when a chapter is living ritual of phi delta theta and when i think about this question come to the conclusion that i know when a chapter is living the when a mom tells me so now going to come back to this as judge concept a little bit later but let me first share thoughts on being a fraternity man with a capital it would be easy and completely appropriate for me to define the as achieving the highest grades on campus providing tremendous amount of community service hours and raising a lot of for charity holding a lot of campus leadership positions and the ritual in all chapter meetings and functions and while each these specific acts are visible public and measurable and all good activities that i certainly encourage for me they this idea of the as i think about the three cardinal principles of friendship learning and rectitude laid out by our founders years ago in bond of phi delta theta and supported in the ritualistic that are the backbone of our fraternity they describe to me characteristics of my concept of a fraternity i want to return for a minute to the original view and perception fraternity men by the broader society i have always been struck by visual representation of a fraternity man which appeared over a ago this drawing coincided with a gathering of delts years ago in louisville kentucky at the general convention this illustration was printed in the and was the first editorial cartoon about fraternity convention ever published if you look closely at cartoon see that it characterizes the phi delt as somewhat larger broader and with more presence than the man he walking next to this cartoon represent him as a drunk slob or frat guy but as phi man as a man of character leader of men this phi delt have been featured on tfm frat the founders of phi delta theta were respected leaders of their and outlined for all of us a set of simple beliefs and which if followed lead to a life of honor respect and to me living the ritual becomes instinctive internalized and in the creation of lifelong habits and it begins at initiation president of phi delta theta i have had the opportunity of and installing many of our newest chapters and to each new chapter the installation banquet i offer the following when you were initiated and all signed the bond of phi delta you agreed to live your lives by three simple principles sound learning and moral rectitude i charge each of you here remember and honor those commitments to each other i charge the men phi delta theta to excel in the classroom to the best of your to sit in the front of class engage with your professors and to the academic to excel on the athletic field or performance venue always your best performance and exhibiting exemplary sportsmanship to engage on the campus get involved in student government other student organizations to lead not just to engage in the local community and serve those in to not abuse alcohol women or each last but not least to act in such a manner both and individually that all of your mothers fathers alumni friends will take pride in you as a fraternity if you do that you will have met the obligations you made when signed the so back to the mom as judge concept i know a chapter is the ritual when i hear from the parent of a phi which usually out to be the mother who calls or writes to tell me about her experience in the fraternity these messages sound like having never been involved in a fraternity before both my husband i were both very impressed and proud to see these young men filled enthusiasm and dedication the fraternity has been a experience for him and i know there will be a void once he this the brothers missouri eta missouri western were going to anyway but they went beyond a philanthropy project and made it personal for my family tanner who has a disability is almost are trying to accept that he will never be married he will never a car and may never attend college he will never have the to be a phi delta theta these men have embraced my family and me for that i am eternally grateful missouri eta chapter from the of my heart i love each and every one of you you are and caring and will always be a blessing in my i was admittedly apprehensive when he expressed an interest becoming involved with a fraternity our family had no experience fraternities or sororities and i had some of the typical regarding the greek system his father and i gave our approval with caveat that he must maintain a high grade point average and jeopardize his scholarship since he wishes to attend law school graduation i am proud to say that he is beginning his senior year has retained his scholarship for all four years in large part due the scholastic emphasis and support of the fraternity i have been impressed with the level of involvement of the alumni with undergraduates in phi delta theta they are truly committed fostering the development of these young men and certainly stress virtues that we all wish to instill in our sons honor loyalty responsibility personally i can attest to new levels of and maturity in my son that i believe are directly attributable to involvement in phi delta with time i have become less concerned with seeing it in terms formal activities and more interested in understanding that the of living the ritual is taking place within our chapters when i from a parent with a testimonial like these i know the chapter living the so in closing here are a few things i believe members of phi theta do every day to live the we care for one another and lift each other we challenge ourselves individually to be better men every we challenge each other to rise to a higher we call a brother out when he is going down the wrong we turn our backs on a brother in we celebrate each we believe in words like fraternity honor duty leadership brotherhood love and not we take pride in identifying ourselves as fraternity we believe in the lifetime commitments we made to each other we signed the my hope is that all of our brothers do these things that we strive to live the ritual to the best of our abilities because members of phi delta

professional life an advertising guy i work alongside our pr professionals all the as well as practitioners from other agencies fun to work them in building a business building their while there are certainly lessons and observations i can draw upon inform this post in the end i find them a little weightless in context of being a instead i got to thinking about reputations within our fraternity the fraternity world we are very lucky to be phi delts one of the best if not the best reputation in the fraternity today other fraternities envy our organization for a variety reasons our educational programming is among the best out providing our undergrads and alumni volunteers with opportunities for growth and development our undergraduates are the best men walking the hills of college campuses across america our alumni are engaged and give tremendous amounts of talent and treasure to phi delt and most importantly we are willing to make hard decisions for the betterment of the in order to honor and perpetuate the objectives of the immortal other groups envy us because we make hard i personally find strength in the notion that i am a member of organization who is willing to do the right thing which leads me reputation management we owe each other and ourselves the effort be the best we can be to manage our reputations individually and an do you like what you see when you look in the mirror do you feel living up to the challenges of the argue that the best reputation management that can be done making sure you can look yourself in the eye being a phi means better than common and challenging ourselves and our brothers to better than the great thing about phi delt is the expectations are clear and to understand and we know when lived up to the challenge when fallen short falling short is ok falling short means recognize the need for improvement and perhaps some help from brothers in the process what there i was given a book call the edge when i went off to kent state

defense of posted on september by by scott mietchen president of the general as many readers of the phi delta theta blog have discovered this is national hazing prevention week and phi delta theta is doing all can to raise awareness about the issue in the past i have about my own experiences of being hazed hazing others and hazing in my own chapter over the years i have sat on both sides many discussions debating the pros and cons of hazing definitions hazing and hazing activities and the appropriateness and of having a culture of hazing within a chapter i hope that others take the time to share their thoughts on hazing in these that our undergraduate brothers give real thought to the expressed but i know that always the case i know that in many chapters across north america there are a certain number of brothers who simply roll their eyes and make some disparaging about yet another lecture on hazing i know that when leaders some chapters stand up in a meeting and propose the need to end that there can often be loud and vigorous to the concept change from some in the and sometimes i wonder why this continues to be an issue in the movement and why some members feel the need to continue hazing to so not going to here a lecture from me today about why is bad today i am writing to extend a sincere and honest to those who believe hazing makes phi delta theta a better the my challenge today directed at those undergraduate brothers either like hazing or have worked to end hazing in their my challenge today is to those brothers who rolled their eyes when thought this was going to be one more lecture chance for the general council president to yammer on about hazing more time my challenge is to those who fight vigorously effectively to keep hazing traditions in here is my challenge and offer to those the phi delta theta blog has become a very effective communication not only for phi delts but for the larger greek community blog are distributed over the facebook fan page to phis the blog posts are also read by other sorority and higher education leaders across north america many entries are and shared through email lists phi delta blog has become a key source for some of leading thought in and about the greek i am offering access to the phi delta theta blog to one member who can write a powerful thoughtful and well reasoned of hazing but there are some parameters and the rules and this is a real this offer is limited to current phi delta theta initiated members it is not open to alumni or the author must write an essay defending which the fraternity will run on the phi delta theta blog next writers can read other blog posts to determine an appropriate the essay does not need to deal with the legality or illegality the essay must discuss at a minimum the following why hazing should be allowed in phi delta why hazing helps create stronger why hazing helps us live up to the principles outlined in the why hazing is philosophically morally and ethically why hazing helps build better analyze and defend the ratio of hazing given that hazing activities have lead to harm injury or even death in cases to those seeking to join greek the essay cannot use the following the military does it they are professionally others do it the why i mom mom just defend why it is good for the betterment of phi in the essay you parse words or hazing activities this not a defense of whether or not doing interviews to meet the brothers or having house chores etc is hazing this needs to written as a defense of the benefits of hazing and the positive nature of things such as but not limited night time or any other big brother night with liquor pressure to consume wall sits calisthenics wearing funny clothes and pranks and eating gross or bad food sleep kangaroo courts or other mental late night runs swims servitude activities for older you get the picture in other words use your essay debate and argue for whether or not getting signatures is a good bad thing keep it intellectually honest and focused on the that everyone would understand as it must be understood that your essay if selected will published under your name anonymity be accepted we all need be willing to publically stand by our how it will be i will reach out to others in the fraternity for their input but will take responsibility for choosing the is a winner in short the answer is no if no essay is submitted that follows rules and parameters or follow the common rules of logic there will be no winning entry however if a essay is submitted then yes there will be a winner have to agree with what the brother writes it just needs to well written argued and neither you or your chapter will be disciplined for submitting an as general council president i offer my word that no brother submits an entry will be subject to discipline by the general or general headquarters i also offer my word that any entry will result in an investigation into activities in your chapter as a of an essay submission for those who know me you know that i by my word this is not a trick or trap this is a sincere only true believers in the benefits of hazing need the purpose of this challenge is not to encourage a brother to write essay defending a point of view they may not believe it this looking for someone to be a advocate this is a challenge those who believe that the effort to hazing is simply wrong and that hazing should be allowed to take in phi delta if you win hand you the fraternity a winning essay will have two significant opportunities to make the case about the benefits of the winning essay will run on the phi delta theta blog reaches well over people in october the writer of the winning essay will receive an trip to st louis in january as my guest at the leadership conference at plc i will yield my primetime spot to the brother to present his essay and make the case for phi delta theta should allow the winner however must also willing to engage in discussion debate with responders to the blog post and with their peers faculty at plc in a public debate so have access to the phi delta theta megaphone but need to be prepared to take part in a discussion about subject with your peers across north how to submit an essays can be submitted directly to me through my personal account my email account can be found on the phi delta theta under the contact us section the deadline for submissions october please include your name chapter and contact number in your submission so i can contact you with any questions winning essay will appear on the phi delta theta blog not long the why this in some ways this challenge harkens back to the early days of fraternity when a great deal of time was spent in chapter debating the significant issues of the day this was how the members of phi delta theta developed their minds analytical skills persuasive debating talents this is where phis learned to take position defend an idea and become a phi delta theta has taken an active stance against hazing for decades and yet it continues in far too many places i can only conclude it continues because there remain active believers in its practice well as defenders of its continuing use there must be phis who believe phi delta efforts to end hazing are wrong if delta theta is wrong in working to eradicate hazing than it would much better to bring the debate out in the public light and let it the scrutiny of active supreme court justice william o douglas once wrote the way to noxious ideas is with other ideas the way to combat falsehoods with this is an opportunity for defenders of hazing to make their case the phi delt nation that phi delta theta should reconsider our on the i encourage phis who have brothers in their chapters who defend protect hazing practices to share this challenge with those and encourage them to submit an essay it be acceptable defend hazing behind closed doors but not be willing to make a defense for its use in our phikeia education i think it is clear where i and the entire general council stand and have stood for many years personally i believe our effort to end hazing is the right decision for phi delta however i also understand that not all brothers may not agree this position it is those brothers i challenge today with genuine offer of challenging the current position microphone is brother

prevention week phi delta theta scott mietchen comments invitation to nfl commissioner roger goodell please join us in to stop posted on august by by scott mietchen general council hazing as the international president of phi delta theta i that anytime i say or write this word many of our members undergraduate and alumni roll their eyes and expect to hear another lecture on the litany of reasons why hazing has no place in greek movement in general or in our fraternity specifically this piece directed at the members of phi delta theta it is directed at one of the most powerful thoughtful and men in the world of sports roger goodell the commissioner of national football you see while the words fraternity and hazing are often together the problem of hazing exists in many areas of our including professional college and high school athletics i refuse accept the common perception that hazing is just a problem in fact i believe that fraternities and sororities and their respective chapters do more try and combat hazing then any organizations i can think of i that the greek system gets most of the focus and i realize we have to completely end these practices within our own organizations though we have been waging the fight against hazing for however we greeks cannot combat hazing alone without key joining with us to end these stupid pointless harmful and dangerous traditions in fact it makes it more difficult for us combat hazing in our own ranks when the media celebrates acts hazing in shows such as the hbo series hard knocks where humorously profiled hazing in the nfl this past that is why i was so pleased to read this past week that jack del head coach of the jacksonville jaguars has banned hazing this from the jaguars rookie training camp after things got out of hand coach del rio defended his decision by saying that needed to have more respect for each other in order to be teammates and with his simple order hazing stopped in the training camp and just this week jason garrett head coach of dallas cowboys followed suit with a similar ban for his for a coach to take this step in the nfl is important because it trickle down to other nfl teams and then into collegiate and school athletics ask any high school athlete coach or referee hazing and you will hear some incredible stories you can google high school sports hazing and read an astonishing number deplorable stories the nfl serves as a role model to high school collegiate athletes whether it accepts the role or not and hazing is accepted and even celebrated in the nfl it makes it acceptable at the high school and collegiate levels by students that hazing is an acceptable i am asking nfl commissioner roger goodell for help last i wrote commissioner goodell a letter asking for his leadership addressing hazing in the nfl and offering as help phi delta years of experience in fighting the issue that request for help the commissioner and offer of assistance by our fraternity today the nfl sets the tone for many norms in our society and players coaches and owners do indeed serve as role models for youth their leadership on any issue can make a difference leadership to join the fight against hazing just might even save at the time i wrote commissioner goodell last fall there were other things on his plate including the recently completed talks between the players and owners those talks are now the players are back in training camp and the nfl will most likely another record breaking season unfortunately the commissioner an opportunity to ban hazing with the recently completed bargaining while i realize that there is much the office throughout the year on a wide variety of issues i would hope that may see the steps recently taken by the jaguars and cowboys as opportunity to use his position of leadership to begin stamping hazing in the nfl his actions now may help lead to the elimination hazing in other levels of sports which can also help us in our against hazing commissioner goodell has the unilateral ability draw the line in the sand regarding behavioral standards in the nfl authority he has used in the past to deal with other issues which viewed as a threat to the league its players i believe commissioner has the decency to take a stand that can affect of young men and women who may never play in his league and beyond illegality of hazing in many states just stupid wrong not suggesting that we blame hazing within our organization on nfl far from it phi delta theta will continue its to stamp out hazing in our own organization regardless of what do however i am suggesting that the active and vocal leadership commissioner goodell on this issue could impact many parts of for decades to commissioner goodell you have the ability to unilaterally stop in the nfl all it takes from you is the stroke of a pen consider joining us in this effort as it will have very consequences far beyond the gates of the national football

management tagged dallas hazing jack del rio jacksonville jaguars garrett national football league nfl phi delta roger goodell rookies comments street shutter fraternities for young faulty logic and wrong posted on april by by scott mietchen general council i am writing as the international president of phi delta fraternity to express my surprise that such a international publication as the wall street journal would allow a weakly argued article as shutter fraternities for young good to appear on its news pages while the piece could certainly been written as an oped piece expressing the personal point of view it appeared in a section reserved news items in my view the writer exhibited journalistic and logic standards and did a tremendous disservice to millions of current undergraduate alumni members who have exemplary fraternity experiences please let me first let me state that what happened to ms seccuro as undergraduate at the university of virginia years ago is horrible and beyond explanation or excuse and i hope the was appropriately punished but however horrible this event was i agree it was horrible it was not caused because a fraternity at the university of virginia for the same reason that it did happen because the university of virginia is coeducational happened because the young men involved did not know the boundaries they legal moral or ethical between right and the author ms flanagan writes the greek system is dedicated quelling young anxiety about submitting themselves to four of book learning by providing them with a variety of activities drinking drugging espn watching and the mistreatment of women i could not disagree with ms flanagan about her broad and untrue characterization of fraternity men this simply not a description of fraternity life that i recognize as i believe her article commits one of the classic logical fallacies confusing association with as the president of phi delta theta fraternity with nearly undergraduate members and alumni members located in chapters over north american campuses i can state unequivocally that characterization of what we are dedicated to is just wrong and based on a stereotypical view often times reinforced in media through movies such as animal house time to put house to rest a movie nothing more not reality i also state unequivocally that i have never heard of any other or international fraternity dedicated to the activities described in the the vast majority of fraternity men i know do not fit the description at all the men i know serve as campus leaders academic success in the classroom take part in academic graduate at higher levels than men move on to or professional schools at higher levels excel on the athletic or artistic venue and serve their communities this may play a role in explaining why fraternity men generally have a great deal pride and affection for their fraternity as well as i sadly have to agree with ms assessment that abuse alcohol is a significant problem on college campuses today and i have to agree that surveys reveal that this problem can fraternity populations at a higher level than the general body i also agree that abuse of alcohol plays a significant role both men and women in many of the challenges facing today whether it be sexual harassment or abuse academic issues or harmful interpersonal the entire greek movement fraternities and sororities working our partners in higher education has been working to educate members and stem the abuse of alcohol for many years each of the than fraternities has developed own approaches for addressing this serious issue i applaud all these proactive efforts for phi delta theta in addition to education programs we have taken the approach of creating housing and removing alcohol from our chapter houses for the decade for our organization this has worked for fraternities other approaches have i wish that all fraternity chapters across north america offered exemplary experience but that would be dishonest unfortunately chapters have lost their way and digressed from the values around they were created it is then up to each fraternity to hold chapters accountable to the values and beliefs of their organizations i believe most fraternities work to hold individual chapters accountable i know that phi delta theta committed to upholding our founding principles of friendship learning and fraternities have existed and thrived on north american campuses nearly two centuries we have our issues that we continue to and we have never claimed to be perfect however as a former university administrator i would argue that fraternities sororities continue to provide an invaluable learning experience complements the classroom experience and that we continue to the best real life leadership learning laboratory on a as the father of two children one a daughter who is in her junior of high school and just beginning the college search process and other a junior high school son i have to admit that i am proud to that i not only believe in the continuing relevance and importance fraternity and sorority system but that i enthusiastically encourage both my son and daughter to consider if is right for them for phi delta theta we have had a chapter at university of virginia since and have a great deal of pride in accomplishments and characteristics of the men that comprise chapter at i think it is unfortunate that the author would take such a personal experience and use it to demonize and categorize the more undergraduate men as well as millions of alumni who belong college fraternal organizations in north america we all corporate employees for the unethical actions of a few we fire all of the faculty of a university because one plagiarizes thesis we cancel all professional sports because some broke the rules and took drugs we down all organizations because one operated in an manner it just how we do this is the story of a despicable rape and its aftermath not a about fraternities a sound argument is a valid argument with premises this article provided neither please use poor and lack of facts to paint all of us

filed under phi delt general council phi delt volunteers tagged liz seccuro phi delta theta scott wall street journal comments journey from being hazed to being an enthusiastic hazer posted on september by by scott mietchen general council this week serves as national hazing prevention week and as council president i was asked to write about why hazing has no in phi delta theta while it would be easy for me to simply repeat greek mantra outlining the evils of hazing in order discredit hazing practices i wanted to use this opportunity to tell own story with hazing and why i feel so strongly about the need bring an end to these practices you see as a phikeia i was as a new initiate i was an active and enthusiastic hazer as a officer i stopped hazing in our chapter this is a bit of my being i pledged phi delta theta at the university of utah in the fall this was just a few years after the release of animal house i was the poster child for the target market for greek life at the i was the consummate joiner i was bound and determined to involved on campus and even though i come from a background i saw fraternity life as the way to immediately involved on this large public university campus going through rush was split between three fraternities at the end of a very formal week period and ultimately decided to pledge phi delta theta because liked the laid back real and friendly nature of the guys i met guys made me feel welcome and soon after our official pledge ceremony we held our first meeting and were given the requirements to complete in order to initiated our requirements included the usual items read and the phikeia manual meet and learn something about all of the organize a community service event organize a social with a pledge class etc the chapter officers also told us that the pledge as identified by the chapter brothers would be recognized initiation with the low bond number of the pledge class competitive i was determined to earn that low bond now i expected some fun and games throughout my pledge because i had seen them in the movies and i figured they were simply rite of passage that i could tolerate and survive my ultimate however was to earn the low bond number and i worked diligently to that top pledge i played the role to the best of my abilities completed my assignments early i mastered facts about the i met with all of the active brothers i maintained a attitude and i adopted the attitude of grin and bear it through hazing hazing in my chapter extremely physical it primarily mental with some minor physical activities included i paddled forced to do calisthenics or consume massive amounts alcohol or dropped off in the dessert somewhere blindfolded and to walk back for me it was more subtle line ups late night sessions servitude yelling demeaning remarks surprise kangaroo courts etc and i excelled at all of it i could recite greek alphabet backwards and forwards before the match burned finger i could stand with a spotlight in my face at am while being yelled and cursed at by the wimpiest guy in chapter who also happened to be fairly inebriated i could say sir faster than almost anyone and mean it i could memorize poems used to address the brothers as well as to answer the phone knew that i could put up with anything because i wanted to be and i wanted that low bond when it came time for initiation or i put up with a lot wore the dumb clothes ate the horrible food carried items campus gave up sleep lived in squalor and continued to endure games mental hazing included those exercises where we were lead believe we be initiated or that our entire pledge class was failure after five days of sleep deprivation spotlights poor food mind games physical stress and threats i have to admit began to wonder if it was all worth it then just as quickly as started it was over and i was initiated however i am sad to say remember much of my own initiation i was simply too tired mentally frayed to pay attention when initiation starts at and ends at am and occurs after five days of hell there little to remember or cherish i was simply in survival mode but the end i had survived and achieved my goal i had been named best pledge and was rewarded with the low bond number in my class it felt great the pledge program had made me a great unfortunately i had also developed some real enmity toward several the brothers and younger alumni who were the most aggressive hazers the chapter i put on a smile in their presence but i developed respect for them and to this day i have no desire to with them at alumni events i always thought it odd that i had a collection of miscellaneous facts and figures about the fraternity but i had not learned very much about what makes for a strong however i rationalized that perhaps learning about running the too important and once i was initiated i wait have my turn to haze the next pledge class now it was my and now it was my turn to be a not long after being initiated we took our spring pledge class part of my own pledge program i had read the prohibiting hazing it was printed right in the phikeia manual but had bought into the tradition and rite of passage rationales think anything bad would happen it was during the first class after mine that i became a great hazer i could demand play mental games and demean the pledges with the best of them the worst hazer but i held my own not proud of the that i could get in a face at am and yell at because he know how many bricks there were in old north dorm believed that if they really wanted to be phis they needed to earn and that this was just part of the path to membership after all had come through just fine and it was by now i was also on the executive committee and had to learn more about the policies i met first chapter consultant from general headquarters and engaged in heated debate with him about what was and was not hazing i to focus on the specific aspects that made an activity a activity because it made for an endless debate however i could quite bring myself to truthfully evaluate whether it was morally ethically right or wrong quite frankly at the time i thought policies were just set by a bunch of general officers who really know what was happening at the at the same time my pledge class had taken on several key positions and decided to try and really upgrade our chapter and some fraternity awards however to do this we knew we needed to something about our pledge program or perhaps we could just about some of our most cherished traditions in our awards why i stopped the the next fall my sophomore year we took a fairly large pledge and our pledge program contained the same hazing traditions and of passage from previous years and i participated as however this time something happened that changed my our phikeia class had completed their pledge program and was for initiation week it was at this point that one of our keith started to become quiet he had always been somewhat but now it was becoming more pronounced our initiation lasted five days with formal initiation on the last evening the first four days of keith became progressively withdrawn more reserved and more quiet quite frankly several of sleep deprivation stress and mental hazing had dimmed the spark his eyes and we started to get having finished the fun of we were preparing the pledge for their formal initiation except that we had a problem when we to get keith for the initiation ceremony we found him in his curled up in the corner of the pledge room rocking back and forth humming he was he had simply gone beyond his for emotional stress and lack of sleep and was now nearly we were able to get keith to his feet and literally helped him each step of the entire initiation ceremony with one brother on arm whispering in his ears the words he was to repeat we were for keith and scared for ourselves toward the end of the when keith realized that he had been initiated his mental started to improve since the emotional stress of the past five days begun to dissipate however as active members we were concerned for safety and for his reaction and to truthful we were terrified that the chapter would get into we persuaded keith to stay at the chapter house for an additional days after initiation so he could sleep and return to a normal state mind which he did however it was then and there that i saw dangers and banality of hazing on that day i and several of pledge brothers made the commitment to end hazing in our chapter had come with the fact that hazing funny entertaining and it can be very stopping hazing i discovered a very simple truth in our fight to end hazing most the brothers in the chapter really like hazing they just along with it because it was tradition except for a small number hardcore hazers and they were hardcore there was very little against stopping the hazing as officers we simply said no hazing and for the most part hazing ended it discussions at ten chapter meetings or a chapter task force anything else it simply took leaders standing up and saying no hazing hazing is defined as any action taken or situation intentionally or unintentionally whether with or without the of the persons subjected to that action which produces mental physical discomfort embarrassment harassment or generally individuals within chapters with hazing cultures of age or status have the same common reply when asked about practices heard the excuses for years and i can tell you experience that they are simply no one will get funny the they like it they said it was okay if they it helps build team cohesiveness and i went through it a rite of one person can stop some may read this and think there they go again one of those national guys preaching to us again about hazing and you know i would understand that mentality because i felt the same way at time but i would ask you to consider for just a minute the morals safety and potential disasters that might occur should program of hazing go wrong i would ask you to consider if you be so resolute in your opinions if you or your chapter damaged or even lost a brother i would ask you to consider would all be worth it for the sake of tradition i would hope you be so nonchalant in ignoring all of the advice and help available you to end hazing in your if your chapter has a hazing problem i ask you as a brother consider taking just one step please consider being that phi who stands up says no more and stops the hazing your chapter become a better place because of your the an amazing thing happened once we stopped the hazing and improved phikeia education program our chapter got remarkably better we in numbers academics quality chapter operations and several years after these changes took hold my chapter went on to some of the most prestigious awards some of my most loyal and active alumni today come from the pledge classes were spared the indignities of hazing and to this day keith one of my best friends he and his wife have raised a great family he remains a loyal and active phi and as i write this i realize beyond that initiation week nearly years ago he and i have talked about this probably something we would all just please remember and consider hazing proud to be a brother mietchen is the general council

thing you wish you could change in the history of successful engineers that has some pretty big companies but also ton of small engineering groups about the environment and many to pursue future targets for energy systems i would change how as a society think of sustainability historically the elders those who work in that do amazing things being an engineer calgary is excit that emit fewer

change demonstrates that the only hard part about answering many understand and desire graduation jason long this question saying absolutely in a cleaner energy systems because of my after graduation is to work at strong enough way thrives concerns about environmental health the interface academia and industry on creativity and i think the most they less smog and less impact i want to unravel

by moe stephens general council in case you heard the united states just finished a significant process election time for me always comes with emotions of excitement for potential change or fear of the same as university administrator all of the election coverage also got me think about the election process for fraternities and sororities north america many of you are electing new executive boards and be feeling many of the same emotions i described if you are running for or have recently been elected president your chapter the task before you is likely intimidating exciting full of the i must preface the following with the realization that i am by no an expert in fraternity and sorority life i am well versed and many experiences in this area but it is such a dynamic that i believe you are the experts because you are living that being said i often meet with new presidents and i provide following communicate authentically there are so many different groups a chapter president must communicate with it can be hard remember whom you have brought into the loop if you are what i call authentic communication it matter everyone are bringing to the table will have the same information it require you to be honest with both yourself and your authentic communication is not always the easiest course of action i guarantee you it will only help when the fecal matter hits oscillating device the more trust you have developed with your constituent groups the easier it will be to work through the before you are now living in the fishbowl the phi delta theta chapter the university of washington has a large glassed in dining area call the fishbowl the sidewalk and street right outside are travelled with students and community members passing by the eats there holds social events there and often has special in the fishbowl i have always thought it was great that the could see into the daily life of a phi delt at uw however i also thought about how difficult that might be at times the chapter does in that room is visible and anyone passing by draw their own conclusions about what is happening as a president you are now living in that fishbowl your actions and are being seen and heard often by people you are not even aware watching and listening you are setting an example for your and broadcasting a message to the rest of your community make sure is the right example be certain it is the right make good choices i often end meetings with the phrase make choices outside of the context of sorority and fraternity life simple phrase is much more difficult and open to interpretation as member of a fraternity or sorority it is actually very simple and live the ritual of your organization within your ritual values that are relevant and have withstood the changing times as ed king stated in his classic piece the secret thoughts of because i am a system of values i am therefore an instrument of evaluation my values are clear and absolute and yet difficult emulate to state a few i am honor courage integrity courtesy and i demand self control as well as ambition and what your founders did is take the idea of friendship and move it significant step forward to the concept of commitment as fraternity and sorority advisor i do not think you are going to perfect however i do expect that you and your chapter members about the values of your organization and use them to guide decisions imagine how much easier it would be to make decisions as executive board if you consistently asked the simple question does this align with friendship sound learning or own it you must be willing to accept responsibility for the of your chapter both past and present noted entrepreneur and jim rohn once said you must take personal responsibility you change the circumstances the seasons or the wind but you can yourself once you decide it is time to own it you can begin process of creating positive enjoy the ride being a chapter president is arguably the difficult leadership position on a college campus you are a model a counselor a mentor an administrator an advisor and spokesperson expectations for chapter presidents are high and should be however many chapter presidents get so caught up in all things to all people that they forget to simply be a sister or brother along with the rest of the responsibilities you have as chapter president it is important for you to remember to have take care of yourself and enjoy the my preference for this blog entry would be for this to be conversation and not just me giving advice of course this is not extensive list of advice for new presidents i am not sure one even be compiled i am interested in hearing from all of you because your voice is the one that truly moe has many years of progressive leadership and success in affairs he has traveled the country working for phi delta theta both a leadership consultant and as the director of expansion moe his wife allison and their

biennial general convention where customs link us to the posted on june by by scott mietchen general council in just a few weeks phis from across north america will gather in capital for the th biennial convention will be the fourth time that we have met in the capital city for such meeting the other times being in and in this summer we are continuing a tradition of meeting on a interval as a fraternity since our founding years the first the first convention was held just three short years after the of phi delta theta when seven phis met on december at woodruff house in cincinnati at the time there were only chapters in the fraternity while that first convention was different in size and scope from the one we will soon experience purpose was the same to discuss the state of our brotherhood and its from walter b authoritative account the history of delta theta we know that the first convention was conceived in when founder john mcmillan wilson miami wrote to robert morrison miami what can be done as to holding a at say cincinnati next christmas holidays or what do you advise the matter the suggestion was carried out when in november wilson wrote to morrison who was in tennessee at the time convention will be held between christmas and day cincinnati the minutes of ohio alpha for december report order to transact some business of a general nature a motion by unanimous voice to call a convention to be represented by graduate and undergraduate members of the several colleges of order to meet on tuesday morning dec messrs ross and harrison were appointed to report to the convention feasibility of establishing other chapters of fdth the meeting on december st first organized itself by electing is miami president and benjamin harrison miami following the convention benjamin harrison john mcmillan wilson lw ross were appointed to communicate the proceedings of convention to the existing in at the first convention seven undergraduate and alumni gathered to discuss the state of phi delta theta chart its future growth determine policies and procedures and celebrate the bonds brotherhood in just a few weeks more than undergraduate alumni phis will gather for the th time in our history for similar while every phi delta theta general convention has its own characteristics and while no two conventions are the same there customs and traditions that have developed through the years create common experiences for phis in attendance this will be th general convention having been present at every one since when i attended my first convention in st louis as an phi i am pleased to tell you about some customs and traditions that hope you will experience when we gather in washington dc which you to the experiences of previous convention attendees these listed in no particular order or customs and traditions which link us to the convention many decades ago members who attended the general convention the practice of wearing small silver bars to designate the number conventions they had attended these bars when linked resemble ladders as phis attend more conventions the lengthen and provide striking evidence of a phis devotion to fraternity each bar indicates the city and year in which convention took place the phi who has attended the most conventions and has the longest ladder in fraternity history executive vice president emeritus robert j miller new mexico brother miller served as the chief executive for before retiring as executive vice president in in dc brother miller will secure his rd ladder since he has every convention since the centennial convention in while at the convention be sure to take a close look at ladder if asked i bet he may even share a story or two past william morrison great grandson of morrison and robert morrison westminster grandson of morrison visit with robert j miller new mexico who displaying the longest convention ladder in phi delta theta history the convention in opening business session roll think of this as a chapter meeting roll call but larger and impressive during the first business session on friday morning meeting will begin with the traditional roll call of chapters clubs and general officers of the fraternity the roll call conducted by executive vice president robert a biggs georgia and it is always impressive to hear how widespread the is across north america it is especially moving for many when biggs introduces a new phi delta theta chapter to the convention the introduction please welcome to their first biennial name of chapter or a reinstalled chapter with the please welcome back to the fold name of introductions are always special for those undergraduates and who worked especially hard during the biennium to be assist chartering a new chapter and are usually acknowledged enthusiastic executive vice president robert a biggs georgia southern conducts the roll call during the first business session of the convention in memorial one of the most solemn events which takes place during the convention is the conducting of the ritualistic ceremony the ceremony which is open to as well and by many family members and surviving spouses acknowledges those who have entered the chapter grand since the last convention and special notice to those alumni who have previously served the fraternity in a mark h ochsenbein eastern kentucky general president presents the wreath during the convention committee reports and convention since the general convention has held all supreme and powers of the fraternity the convention has three responsibilities and powers they electing the general consideration of judicial enacting laws for the regulation of the fraternity since only general convention may amend the ritual constitution and statutes of the there will be approximately voting delegates in attendance undergraduate chapter delegates holding about of the voting of the convention imagine a big chapter room with voting phi delta theta is a democratic fraternity and in order to conduct the business of the fraternity a number of committees appointed by the general council to consider issues being presented the convention these committees are composed of both undergraduate alumni voting delegates and discuss issues for the convention committee meetings prior to bringing them to the floor for and voting committees include code committee credentials committee procedure committee nominating appeals committee resolutions committee and wardens committee once committee has reviewed an item under its jurisdiction than it can brought to the convention floor where it will be discussed and necessary voted upon just like in a chapter an undergraduate member of the code committee presents legislation to the convention floor during the convention meet the one of the most important responsibilities of the general convention to elect the five men who will lead the fraternity for the next years as members of the general council the men elected to general council are charged to be the legal representative of fraternity and custodian of the property of the fraternity the council shall interpret and administer all laws of the fraternity make such policies and appointments as may be necessary to promote general welfare of the fraternity living within the regulations the constitution and general statutes of the fraternity the elected to the general council chart the course initiatives and direction of phi delta theta for the biennium beyond during the convention delegates have the chance to meet each of the candidates for the general council in the meet candidates forum in this format each candidate rotates through groups of voting delegates to discuss their ideas and thoughts for future of the fraternity and answer questions from delegates elections matter and the the allow delegates to have questions answered learn about the ideas priorities of the individual candidates who are running for and determine whom to vote for in this election decisions and actions of the general council affect many areas of fraternity and this is the time when delegates help determine future of phi delta general council reporter richard e fabritius kent state with a group of delegates during the general convention session to answer questions about the future of fraternity from convention delegates brother fabritius went on to during the general council model imagine being initiated in a large room in front of hundreds of serving as the chapter with the initiation being conducted by general council for a few men this is precisely will happen to them in washington dc during every convention model initiation is conducted and several new brothers are into the fraternity what an honor and privilege for these brothers to share their initiation experience with phis from north several men will sign the bond of phi delta theta and become during the convention much like lou gehrig columbia signed bond of the new york delta chapter on april the gehrig will be on display during the changing of the during every general convention there is a changing of the guard one general council to the next as the general council is charged overseeing the fraternity between conventions this biennial represents an important orderly transfer of leadership and the formal transition will take place during the business session on saturday afternoon once the council is sworn into office by the convention warden i will have honor as phi delta rd president of pinning the council pin on phi delta th president the leadership transition end with the pinning at this since i will be a past president of the general council ppgc other sitting on the front row will somehow it necessary to help escort me to my new retirement seat with other past presidents sometimes this is done with careful to providing a new ppgc with balance by carefully holding a new elbow providing a cane or perhaps even a general council president mark h ochsenbein kentucky is presented with a special plaque after pinning general council president m scott mietchen utah with the council badge shortly thereafter brother ochsenbein escorted to his new seat with the other past recognition of outstanding the best and the brightest are acknowledged in many ways during convention awards are presented recognizing many aspects of life with the awarding of the most prestigious awards reserved for grand banquet on the final night the outstanding work and traits our chapters is on full display during the several different the george e housser trophy recognizing the most outstanding chapter was presented to the phis of nova scotia alpha at university during the convention in paradise valley arizona trophy is a canadian inuit soapstone carving called the bird memorabilia from the fraternity the fraternity has quite an important collection of fraternity alumni memorabilia on display at general headquarters in oxford unfortunately hard for many to see these items unless they to ghq however during the convention the fraternity brings some the items and displays them for attendees in addition to historic delta theta badges and publications items of interest which are on display include the gehrig bond neil phi delta badge that he took to the moon and the academy award won by francis lyon ucla definitely want to have a camera with you you take a look at the on display during the convention will be the oscar won by francis and later presented by brother lyon to the general these represent just a few of the many customs and traditions will experience next month i look forward to seeing many of you our phi delt nation in washington dc as we celebrate all of great things taking place in phi delta theta and take part in many the same traditions and customs that tie us to those whom came us please travel safely and have another great brother mietchen is the general council

state university scott his wife and their children abby and alex live in salt lake filed under brotherhood phi delt general council general convention phi delta theta washington dc comment love your home chapter while serving an international posted on may by by rich fabritius general my phi delt experience has been filled by the presence of so tremendous volunteers many of them have never gotten a mention in scroll or during a convention but they work hard for our men and alumni brothers day after day been asked to write a fraternity volunteer enriched my experience and my life general my variety of great experiences with many a phi volunteer makes it difficult to comment on one my first contact with the general fraternity was through my president when i was an undergraduate brother george porosky with mercedes benz parked in the street across from the chapter house parking lights on he was a consistent positive presence in chapter patient and ever in control george steered us when we it and let us go when we needed to learn a lesson he hated chapter meetings he thought they were too long an engineer so think some of our ridiculousness was in firm contrast to constitution those meetings were long very long he was right course but they were fun and i remember thinking there was no place on the planet rather be than down in the chapter room sunday nights george is a main figure in my memory of but the volunteer who taught me perhaps my most treasured lesson phi delta theta is brother jim warner jim succeeded george province president of sigma south and prowls the sidelines of ohio for us to this day jim was an adviser at akron with ohio his alma mater just like george when i first met him i was undergraduate and remember meeting him at a kent state now there is a rivalry between akron and kent both and between our chapters so i was a tad perplexed by the presence an at a kent homecoming but when i met jim i quickly that he care about what chapter you were from he about you and he cared about phi delta theta i learned from jim lesson that has led me to this position today on the general i learned that phi delt just about your home chapter and a whole lot more than that i learned that phi delt is international brotherhood not a chapter i learned that you can your home chapter while serving an international brotherhood learned that phi delt is a whole lot bigger than kent university and make no mistake about it i love kent state and never be able to repay jim for the gift he gave me he planted me a curiosity about the larger organization i developed a thirst know our brotherhood beyond the buildings of kent ohio curiosity lead me to intern at the general headquarters which lead employment on the ghq staff while working for ghq i met my wife this day gift returns to me daily i imagine life without phi delta theta i imagine my experience without the deep gratifying experiences had the general fraternity and i imagine being a phi without as my brother mentor and thanks brother fabritius is the general council reporter his other service to phi delt has included education commissioner and president rich lives in atlanta with his

tells me so now going to come back to this as judge concept a little bit later but let me first share thoughts on being a fraternity man with a capital it would be easy and completely appropriate for me to define the as achieving the highest grades on campus providing tremendous amount of community service hours and raising a lot of for charity holding a lot of campus leadership positions and the ritual in all chapter meetings and functions and while each these specific acts are visible public and measurable and all good activities that i certainly encourage for me they this idea of the as i think about the three cardinal principles of friendship learning and rectitude laid out by our founders years ago in bond of phi delta theta and supported in the ritualistic that are the backbone of our fraternity they describe to me characteristics of my concept of a fraternity i want to return for a minute to the original view and perception fraternity men by the broader society i have always been struck by visual representation of a fraternity man which appeared over a ago this drawing coincided with a gathering of delts years ago in louisville kentucky at the general convention this illustration was printed in the and was the first editorial cartoon about fraternity convention ever published if you look closely at cartoon see that it characterizes the phi delt as somewhat larger broader and with more presence than the man he walking next to this cartoon represent him as a drunk slob or frat guy but as phi man as a man of character leader of men this phi delt have been featured on tfm frat the founders of phi delta theta were respected leaders of their and outlined for all of us a set of simple beliefs and which if followed lead to a life of honor respect and to me living the ritual becomes instinctive internalized and in the creation of lifelong habits and it begins at initiation president of phi delta theta i have had the opportunity of and installing many of our newest chapters and to each new chapter the installation banquet i offer the following when you were initiated and all signed the bond of phi delta you agreed to live your lives by three simple principles sound learning and moral rectitude i charge each of you here remember and honor those commitments to each other i charge the men phi delta theta to excel in the classroom to the best of your to sit in the front of class engage with your professors and to the academic to excel on the athletic field or performance venue always your best performance and exhibiting exemplary sportsmanship to engage on the campus get involved in student government other student organizations to lead not just to engage in the local community and serve those in to not abuse alcohol women or each last but not least to act in such a manner both and individually that all of your mothers fathers alumni friends will take pride in you as a fraternity if you do that you will have met the obligations you made when signed the so back to the mom as judge concept i know a chapter is the ritual when i hear from the parent of a phi which usually out to be the mother who calls or writes to tell me about her experience in the fraternity these messages sound like having never been involved in a fraternity before both my husband i were both very impressed and proud to see these young men filled enthusiasm and dedication the fraternity has been a experience for him and i know there will be a void once he this the brothers missouri eta missouri western were going to anyway but they went beyond a philanthropy project and made it personal for my family tanner who has a disability is almost are trying to accept that he will never be married he will never a car and may never attend college he will never have the to be a phi delta theta these men have embraced my family and me for that i am eternally grateful missouri eta chapter from the of my heart i love each and every one of you you are and caring and will always be a blessing in my i was admittedly apprehensive when he expressed an interest becoming involved with a fraternity our family had no experience fraternities or sororities and i had some of the typical regarding the greek system his father and i gave our approval with caveat that he must maintain a high grade point average and jeopardize his scholarship since he wishes to attend law school graduation i am proud to say that he is beginning his senior year has retained his scholarship for all four years in large part due the scholastic emphasis and support of the fraternity i have been impressed with the level of involvement of the alumni with undergraduates in phi delta theta they are truly committed fostering the development of these young men and certainly stress virtues that we all wish to instill in our sons honor loyalty responsibility personally i can attest to new levels of and maturity in my son that i believe are directly attributable to involvement in phi delta with time i have become less concerned with seeing it in terms formal activities and more interested in understanding that the of living the ritual is taking place within our chapters when i from a parent with a testimonial like these i know the chapter living the so in closing here are a few things i believe members of phi theta do every day to live the we care for one another and lift each other we challenge ourselves individually to be better men every we challenge each other to rise to a higher we call a brother out when he is going down the wrong we turn our backs on a brother in we celebrate each we believe in words like fraternity honor duty leadership brotherhood love and not we take pride in identifying ourselves as fraternity we believe in the lifetime commitments we made to each other we signed the my hope is that all of our brothers do these things that we strive to live the ritual to the best of our abilities because members of phi delta

professional life an advertising guy i work alongside our pr professionals all the as well as practitioners from other agencies fun to work them in building a business building their while there are certainly lessons and observations i can draw upon inform this post in the end i find them a little weightless in context of being a instead i got to thinking about reputations within our fraternity the fraternity world we are very lucky to be phi delts one of the best if not the best reputation in the fraternity today other fraternities envy our organization for a variety reasons our educational programming is among the best out providing our undergrads and alumni volunteers with opportunities for growth and development our undergraduates are the best men walking the hills of college campuses across america our alumni are engaged and give tremendous amounts of talent and treasure to phi delt and most importantly we are willing to make hard decisions for the betterment of the in order to honor and perpetuate the objectives of the immortal other groups envy us because we make hard i personally find strength in the notion that i am a member of organization who is willing to do the right thing which leads me reputation management we owe each other and ourselves the effort be the best we can be to manage our reputations individually and an do you like what you see when you look in the mirror do you feel living up to the challenges of the argue that the best reputation management that can be done making sure you can look yourself in the eye being a phi means better than common and challenging ourselves and our brothers to better than the great thing about phi delt is the expectations are clear and to understand and we know when lived up to the challenge when fallen short falling short is ok falling short means recognize the need for improvement and perhaps some help from brothers in the process what there i was given a book call the edge when i went off to kent state it a compilation of inspirational quotes and stories the was a cleveland area high school wrestling coach with the of my badge it was my most prized possession in college many an rolled when i quoted

management and policy at heinz college of carnegie mellon filed under career advice phi delt general uncategorized tagged advice career development chris brussalis phi theta values leave a comment defense of posted on september by by scott mietchen president of the general as many readers of the phi delta theta blog have discovered this is national hazing prevention week and phi delta theta is doing all can to raise awareness about the issue in the past i have about my own experiences of being hazed hazing others and hazing in my own chapter over the years i have sat on both sides many discussions debating the pros and cons of hazing definitions hazing and hazing activities and the appropriateness and of having a culture of hazing within a chapter i hope that others take the time to share their thoughts on hazing in these that our undergraduate brothers give real thought to the expressed but i know that always the case i know that in many chapters across north america there are a certain number of brothers who simply roll their eyes and make some disparaging about yet another lecture on hazing i know that when leaders some chapters stand up in a meeting and propose the need to end that there can often be loud and vigorous to the concept change from some in the and sometimes i wonder why this continues to be an issue in the movement and why some members feel the need to continue hazing to so not going to here a lecture from me today about why is bad today i am writing to extend a sincere and honest to those who believe hazing makes phi delta theta a better the my challenge today directed at those undergraduate brothers either like hazing or have worked to end hazing in their my challenge today is to those brothers who rolled their eyes when thought this was going to be one more lecture chance for the general council president to yammer on about hazing more time my challenge is to those who fight vigorously effectively to keep hazing traditions in here is my challenge and offer to those the phi delta theta blog has become a very effective communication not only for phi delts but for the larger greek community blog are distributed over the facebook fan page to phis the blog posts are also read by other sorority and higher education leaders across north america many entries are and shared through email lists phi delta blog has become a key source for some of leading thought in and about the greek i am offering access to the phi delta theta blog to one member who can write a powerful thoughtful and well reasoned of hazing but there are some parameters and the rules and this is a real this offer is limited to current phi delta theta initiated members it is not open to alumni or the author must write an essay defending which the fraternity will run on the phi delta theta blog next writers can read other blog posts to determine an appropriate the essay does not need to deal with the legality or illegality the essay must discuss at a minimum the following why hazing should be allowed in phi delta why hazing helps create stronger why hazing helps us live up to the principles outlined in the why hazing is philosophically morally and ethically why hazing helps build better analyze and defend the ratio of hazing given that hazing activities have lead to harm injury or even death in cases to those seeking to join greek the essay cannot use the following the military does it they are professionally others do it the why i mom mom just defend why it is good for the betterment of phi in the essay you parse words or hazing activities this not a defense of whether or not doing interviews to meet the brothers or having house chores etc is hazing this needs to written as a defense of the benefits of hazing and the positive nature of things such as but not limited night time or any other big brother night with liquor pressure to consume wall sits calisthenics wearing funny clothes and pranks and eating gross or bad food sleep kangaroo courts or other mental late night runs swims servitude activities for older you get the picture in other words use your essay debate and argue for whether or not getting signatures is a good bad thing keep it intellectually honest and focused on the that everyone would understand as it must be understood that your essay if selected will published under your name anonymity be accepted we all need be willing to publically stand by our how it will be i will reach out to others in the fraternity for their input but will take responsibility for choosing the is a winner in short the answer is no if no essay is submitted that follows rules and parameters or follow the common rules of logic there will be no winning entry however if a essay is submitted then yes there will be a winner have to agree with what the brother writes it just needs to well written argued and neither you or your chapter will be disciplined for submitting an as general council president i offer my word that no brother submits an entry will be subject to discipline by the general or general headquarters i also offer my word that any entry will result in an investigation into activities in your chapter as a of an essay submission for those who know me you know that i by my word this is not a trick or trap this is a sincere only true believers in the benefits of hazing need the purpose of this challenge is not to encourage a brother to write essay defending a point of view they may not believe it this looking for someone to be a advocate this is a challenge those who believe that the effort to hazing is simply wrong and that hazing should be allowed to take in phi delta if you win hand you the fraternity a winning essay will have two significant opportunities to make the case about the benefits of the winning essay will run on the phi delta theta blog reaches well over people in october the writer of the winning essay will receive an trip to st louis in january as my guest at the leadership conference at plc i will yield my primetime spot to the brother to present his essay and make the case for phi delta theta should allow the winner however must also willing to engage in discussion debate with responders to the blog post and with their peers faculty at plc in a public debate so have access to the phi delta theta megaphone but need to be prepared to take part in a discussion about subject with your peers across north how to submit an essays can be submitted directly to me through my personal account my email account can be found on the phi delta theta under the contact us section the deadline for submissions october please include your name chapter and contact number in your submission so i can contact you with any questions winning essay will appear on the phi delta theta blog not long the why this in some ways this challenge harkens back to the early days of fraternity when a great deal of time was spent in chapter debating the significant issues of the day this was how the members of phi delta theta developed their minds analytical skills persuasive debating talents this is where phis learned to take position defend an idea and become a phi delta theta has taken an active stance against hazing for decades and yet it continues in far too many places i can only conclude it continues because there remain active believers in its practice well as defenders of its continuing use there must be phis who believe phi delta efforts to end hazing are wrong if delta theta is wrong in working to eradicate hazing than it would much better to bring the debate out in the public light and let it the scrutiny of active supreme court justice william o douglas once wrote the way to noxious ideas is with other ideas the way to combat falsehoods with this is an opportunity for defenders of hazing to make their case the phi delt nation that phi delta theta should reconsider our on the i encourage phis who have brothers in their chapters who defend protect hazing practices to share this challenge with those and encourage them to submit an essay it be acceptable defend hazing behind closed doors but not be willing to make a defense for its use in our phikeia education i think it is clear where i and the entire general council stand and have stood for many years personally i believe our effort to end hazing is the right decision for phi delta however i also understand that not all brothers may not agree this position it is those brothers i challenge today with genuine offer of challenging the current position microphone is brother

prevention week phi delta theta scott mietchen comments invitation to nfl commissioner roger goodell please join us in to stop posted on august by by scott mietchen general council hazing as the international president of phi delta theta i that anytime i say or write this word many of our members undergraduate and alumni roll their eyes and expect to hear another lecture on the litany of reasons why hazing has no place in greek movement in general or in our fraternity specifically this piece directed at the members of phi delta theta it is directed at one of the most powerful thoughtful and men in the world of sports roger goodell the commissioner of national football you see while the words fraternity and hazing are often together the problem of hazing exists in many areas of our including professional college and high school athletics i refuse accept the common perception that hazing is just a problem in fact i believe that fraternities and sororities and their respective chapters do more try and combat hazing then any organizations i can think of i that the greek system gets most of the focus and i realize we have to completely end these practices within our own organizations though we have been waging the fight against hazing for however we greeks cannot combat hazing alone without key joining with us to end these stupid pointless harmful and dangerous traditions in fact it makes it more difficult for us combat hazing in our own ranks when the media celebrates acts hazing in shows such as the hbo series hard knocks where humorously profiled hazing in the nfl this past that is why i was so pleased to read this past week that jack del head coach of the jacksonville jaguars has banned hazing this from the jaguars rookie training camp after things got out of hand coach del rio defended his decision by saying that needed to have more respect for each other in order to be teammates and with his simple order hazing stopped in the training camp and just this week jason garrett head coach of dallas cowboys followed suit with a similar ban for his for a coach to take this step in the nfl is important because it trickle down to other nfl teams and then into collegiate and school athletics ask any high school athlete coach or referee hazing and you will hear some incredible stories you can google high school sports hazing and read an astonishing number deplorable stories the nfl serves as a role model to high school collegiate athletes whether it accepts the role or not and hazing is accepted and even celebrated in the nfl it makes it acceptable at the high school and collegiate levels by students that hazing is an acceptable i am asking nfl commissioner roger goodell for help last i wrote commissioner goodell a letter asking for his leadership addressing hazing in the nfl and offering as help phi delta years of experience in fighting the issue that request for help the commissioner and offer of assistance by our fraternity today the nfl sets the tone for many norms in our society and players coaches and owners do indeed serve as role models for youth their leadership on any issue can make a difference leadership to join the fight against hazing just might even save at the time i wrote commissioner goodell last fall there were other things on his plate including the recently completed talks between the players and owners those talks are now the players are back in training camp and the nfl will most likely another record breaking season unfortunately the commissioner an opportunity to ban hazing with the recently completed bargaining while i realize that there is much the office throughout the year on a wide variety of issues i would hope that may see the steps recently taken by the jaguars and cowboys as opportunity to use his position of leadership to begin stamping hazing in the nfl his actions now may help lead to the elimination hazing in other levels of sports which can also help us in our against hazing commissioner goodell has the unilateral ability draw the line in the sand regarding behavioral standards in the nfl authority he has used in the past to deal with other issues which viewed as a threat to the league its players i believe commissioner has the decency to take a stand that can affect of young men and women who may never play in his league and beyond illegality of hazing in many states just stupid wrong not suggesting that we blame hazing within our organization on nfl far from it phi delta theta will continue its to stamp out hazing in our own organization regardless of what do however i am suggesting that the active and vocal leadership commissioner goodell on this issue could impact many parts of for decades to commissioner goodell you have the ability to unilaterally stop in the nfl all it takes from you is the stroke of a pen consider joining us in this effort as it will have very consequences far beyond the gates of the national football

wrong posted on april by by scott mietchen general council i am writing as the international president of phi delta fraternity to express my surprise that such a international publication as the wall street journal would allow a weakly argued article as shutter fraternities for young good to appear on its news pages while the piece could certainly been written as an oped piece expressing the personal point of view it appeared in a section reserved news items in my view the writer exhibited journalistic and logic standards and did a tremendous disservice to millions of current undergraduate alumni members who have exemplary fraternity experiences please let me first let me state that what happened to ms seccuro as undergraduate at the university of virginia years ago is horrible and beyond explanation or excuse and i hope the was appropriately punished but however horrible this event was i agree it was horrible it was not caused because a fraternity at the university of virginia for the same reason that it did happen because the university of virginia is coeducational happened because the young men involved did not know the boundaries they legal moral or ethical between right and the author ms flanagan writes the greek system is dedicated quelling young anxiety about submitting themselves to four of book learning by providing them with a variety of activities drinking drugging espn watching and the mistreatment of women i could not disagree with ms flanagan about her broad and untrue characterization of fraternity men this simply not a description of fraternity life that i recognize as i believe her article commits one of the classic logical fallacies confusing association with as the president of phi delta theta fraternity with nearly undergraduate members and alumni members located in chapters over north american campuses i can state unequivocally that characterization of what we are dedicated to is just wrong and based on a stereotypical view often times reinforced in media through movies such as animal house time to put house to rest a movie nothing more not reality i also state unequivocally that i have never heard of any other or international fraternity dedicated to the activities described in the the vast majority of fraternity men i know do not fit the description at all the men i know serve as campus leaders academic success in the classroom take part in academic graduate at higher levels than men move on to or professional schools at higher levels excel on the athletic or artistic venue and serve their communities this may play a role in explaining why fraternity men generally have a great deal pride and affection for their fraternity as well as i sadly have to agree with ms assessment that abuse alcohol is a significant problem on college campuses today and i have to agree that surveys reveal that this problem can fraternity populations at a higher level than the general body i also agree that abuse of alcohol plays a significant role both men and women in many of the challenges facing today whether it be sexual harassment or abuse academic issues or harmful interpersonal the entire greek movement fraternities and sororities working our partners in higher education has been working to educate members and stem the abuse of alcohol for many years each of the than fraternities has developed own approaches for addressing this serious issue i applaud all these proactive efforts for phi delta theta in addition to education programs we have taken the approach of creating housing and removing alcohol from our chapter houses for the decade for our organization this has worked for fraternities other approaches have i wish that all fraternity chapters across north america offered exemplary experience but that would be dishonest unfortunately chapters have lost their way and digressed from the values around they were created it is then up to each fraternity to hold chapters accountable to the values and beliefs of their organizations i believe most fraternities work to hold individual chapters accountable i know that phi delta theta committed to upholding our founding principles of friendship learning and fraternities have existed and thrived on north american campuses nearly two centuries we have our issues that we continue to and we have never claimed to be perfect however as a former university administrator i would argue that fraternities sororities continue to provide an invaluable learning experience complements the classroom experience and that we continue to the best real life leadership learning laboratory on a as the father of two children one a daughter who is in her junior of high school and just beginning the college search process and other a junior high school son i have to admit that i am proud to that i not only believe in the continuing relevance and importance fraternity and sorority system but that i enthusiastically encourage both my son and daughter to consider if is right for them for phi delta theta we have had a chapter at university of virginia since and have a great deal of pride in accomplishments and characteristics of the men that comprise chapter at i think it is unfortunate that the author would take such a personal experience and use it to demonize and categorize the more undergraduate men as well as millions of alumni who belong college fraternal organizations in north america we all corporate employees for the unethical actions of a few we fire all of the faculty of a university because one plagiarizes thesis we cancel all professional sports because some broke the rules and took drugs we down all organizations because one operated in an manner it just how we do this is the story of a despicable rape and its aftermath not a about fraternities a sound argument is a valid argument with premises this article provided neither please use poor and lack of facts to paint all of us

september by by scott mietchen general council this week serves as national hazing prevention week and as council president i was asked to write about why hazing has no in phi delta theta while it would be easy for me to simply repeat greek mantra outlining the evils of hazing in order discredit hazing practices i wanted to use this opportunity to tell own story with hazing and why i feel so strongly about the need bring an end to these practices you see as a phikeia i was as a new initiate i was an active and enthusiastic hazer as a officer i stopped hazing in our chapter this is a bit of my being i pledged phi delta theta at the university of utah in the fall this was just a few years after the release of animal house i was the poster child for the target market for greek life at the i was the consummate joiner i was bound and determined to involved on campus and even though i come from a background i saw fraternity life as the way to immediately involved on this large public university campus going through rush was split between three fraternities at the end of a very formal week period and ultimately decided to pledge phi delta theta because liked the laid back real and friendly nature of the guys i met guys made me feel welcome and soon after our official pledge ceremony we held our first meeting and were given the requirements to complete in order to initiated our requirements included the usual items read and the phikeia manual meet and learn something about all of the organize a community service event organize a social with a pledge class etc the chapter officers also told us that the pledge as identified by the chapter brothers would be recognized initiation with the low bond number of the pledge class competitive i was determined to earn that low bond now i expected some fun and games throughout my pledge because i had seen them in the movies and i figured they were simply rite of passage that i could tolerate and survive my ultimate however was to earn the low bond number and i worked diligently to that top pledge i played the role to the best of my abilities completed my assignments early i mastered facts about the i met with all of the active brothers i maintained a attitude and i adopted the attitude of grin and bear it through hazing hazing in my chapter extremely physical it primarily mental with some minor physical activities included i paddled forced to do calisthenics or consume massive amounts alcohol or dropped off in the dessert somewhere blindfolded and to walk back for me it was more subtle line ups late night sessions servitude yelling demeaning remarks surprise kangaroo courts etc and i excelled at all of it i could recite greek alphabet backwards and forwards before the match burned finger i could stand with a spotlight in my face at am while being yelled and cursed at by the wimpiest guy in chapter who also happened to be fairly inebriated i could say sir faster than almost anyone and mean it i could memorize poems used to address the brothers as well as to answer the phone knew that i could put up with anything because i wanted to be and i wanted that low bond when it came time for initiation or i put up with a lot wore the dumb clothes ate the horrible food carried items campus gave up sleep lived in squalor and continued to endure games mental hazing included those exercises where we were lead believe we be initiated or that our entire pledge class was failure after five days of sleep deprivation spotlights poor food mind games physical stress and threats i have to admit began to wonder if it was all worth it then just as quickly as started it was over and i was initiated however i am sad to say remember much of my own initiation i was simply too tired mentally frayed to pay attention when initiation starts at and ends at am and occurs after five days of hell there little to remember or cherish i was simply in survival mode but the end i had survived and achieved my goal i had been named best pledge and was rewarded with the low bond number in my class it felt great the pledge program had made me a great unfortunately i had also developed some real enmity toward several the brothers and younger alumni who were the most aggressive hazers the chapter i put on a smile in their presence but i developed respect for them and to this day i have no desire to with them at alumni events i always thought it odd that i had a collection of miscellaneous facts and figures about the fraternity but i had not learned very much about what makes for a strong however i rationalized that perhaps learning about running the too important and once i was initiated i wait have my turn to haze the next pledge class now it was my and now it was my turn to be a not long after being initiated we took our spring pledge class part of my own pledge program i had read the prohibiting hazing it was printed right in the phikeia manual but had bought into the tradition and rite of passage rationales think anything bad would happen it was during the first class after mine that i became a great hazer i could demand play mental games and demean the pledges with the best of them the worst hazer but i held my own not proud of the that i could get in a face at am and yell at because he know how many bricks there were in old north dorm believed that if they really wanted to be phis they needed to earn and that this was just part of the path to membership after all had come through just fine and it was by now i was also on the executive committee and had to learn more about the policies i met first chapter consultant from general headquarters and engaged in heated debate with him about what was and was not hazing i to focus on the specific aspects that made an activity a activity because it made for an endless debate however i could quite bring myself to truthfully evaluate whether it was morally ethically right or wrong quite frankly at the time i thought policies were just set by a bunch of general officers who really know what was happening at the at the same time my pledge class had taken on several key positions and decided to try and really upgrade our chapter and some fraternity awards however to do this we knew we needed to something about our pledge program or perhaps we could just about some of our most cherished traditions in our awards why i stopped the the next fall my sophomore year we took a fairly large pledge and our pledge program contained the same hazing traditions and of passage from previous years and i participated as however this time something happened that changed my our phikeia class had completed their pledge program and was for initiation week it was at this point that one of our keith started to become quiet he had always been somewhat but now it was becoming more pronounced our initiation lasted five days with formal initiation on the last evening the first four days of keith became progressively withdrawn more reserved and more quiet quite frankly several of sleep deprivation stress and mental hazing had dimmed the spark his eyes and we started to get having finished the fun of we were preparing the pledge for their formal initiation except that we had a problem when we to get keith for the initiation ceremony we found him in his curled up in the corner of the pledge room rocking back and forth humming he was he had simply gone beyond his for emotional stress and lack of sleep and was now nearly we were able to get keith to his feet and literally helped him each step of the entire initiation ceremony with one brother on arm whispering in his ears the words he was to repeat we were for keith and scared for ourselves toward the end of the when keith realized that he had been initiated his mental started to improve since the emotional stress of the past five days begun to dissipate however as active members we were concerned for safety and for his reaction and to truthful we were terrified that the chapter would get into we persuaded keith to stay at the chapter house for an additional days after initiation so he could sleep and return to a normal state mind which he did however it was then and there that i saw dangers and banality of hazing on that day i and several of pledge brothers made the commitment to end hazing in our chapter had come with the fact that hazing funny entertaining and it can be very stopping hazing i discovered a very simple truth in our fight to end hazing most the brothers in the chapter really like hazing they just along with it because it was tradition except for a small number hardcore hazers and they were hardcore there was very little against stopping the hazing as officers we simply said no hazing and for the most part hazing ended it discussions at ten chapter meetings or a chapter task force anything else it simply took leaders standing up and saying no hazing hazing is defined as any action taken or situation intentionally or unintentionally whether with or without the of the persons subjected to that action which produces mental physical discomfort embarrassment harassment or generally individuals within chapters with hazing cultures of age or status have the same common reply when asked about practices heard the excuses for years and i can tell you experience that they are simply no one will get funny the they like it they said it was okay if they it helps build team cohesiveness and i went through it a rite of one person can stop some may read this and think there they go again one of those national guys preaching to us again about hazing and you know i would understand that mentality because i felt the same way at time but i would ask you to consider for just a minute the morals safety and potential disasters that might occur should program of hazing go wrong i would ask you to consider if you be so resolute in your opinions if you or your chapter damaged or even lost a brother i would ask you to consider would all be worth it for the sake of tradition i would hope you be so nonchalant in ignoring all of the advice and help available you to end hazing in your if your chapter has a hazing problem i ask you as a brother consider taking just one step please consider being that phi who stands up says no more and stops the hazing your chapter become a better place because of your the an amazing thing happened once we stopped the hazing and improved phikeia education program our chapter got remarkably better we in numbers academics quality chapter operations and several years after these changes took hold my chapter went on to some of the most prestigious awards some of my most loyal and active alumni today come from the pledge classes were spared the indignities of hazing and to this day keith one of my best friends he and his wife have raised a great family he remains a loyal and active phi and as i write this i realize beyond that initiation week nearly years ago he and i have talked about this probably something we would all just please remember and consider hazing proud to be a brother mietchen is the general council

by moe stephens general council in case you heard the united states just finished a significant process election time for me always comes with emotions of excitement for potential change or fear of the same as university administrator all of the election coverage also got me think about the election process for fraternities and sororities north america many of you are electing new executive boards and be feeling many of the same emotions i described if you are running for or have recently been elected president your chapter the task before you is likely intimidating exciting full of the i must preface the following with the realization that i am by no an expert in fraternity and sorority life i am well versed and many experiences in this area but it is such a dynamic that i believe you are the experts because you are living that being said i often meet with new presidents and i provide following communicate authentically there are so many different groups a chapter president must communicate with it can be hard remember whom you have brought into the loop if you are what i call authentic communication it matter everyone are bringing to the table will have the same information it require you to be honest with both yourself and your authentic communication is not always the easiest course of action i guarantee you it will only help when the fecal matter hits oscillating device the more trust you have developed with your constituent groups the easier it will be to work through the before you are now living in the fishbowl the phi delta theta chapter the university of washington has a large glassed in dining area call the fishbowl the sidewalk and street right outside are travelled with students and community members passing by the eats there holds social events there and often has special in the fishbowl i have always thought it was great that the could see into the daily life of a phi delt at uw however i also thought about how difficult that might be at times the chapter does in that room is visible and anyone passing by draw their own conclusions about what is happening as a president you are now living in that fishbowl your actions and are being seen and heard often by people you are not even aware watching and listening you are setting an example for your and broadcasting a message to the rest of your community make sure is the right example be certain it is the right make good choices i often end meetings with the phrase make choices outside of the context of sorority and fraternity life simple phrase is much more difficult and open to interpretation as member of a fraternity or sorority it is actually very simple and live the ritual of your organization within your ritual values that are relevant and have withstood the changing times as ed king stated in his classic piece the secret thoughts of because i am a system of values i am therefore an instrument of evaluation my values are clear and absolute and yet difficult emulate to state a few i am honor courage integrity courtesy and i demand self control as well as ambition and what your founders did is take the idea of friendship and move it significant step forward to the concept of commitment as fraternity and sorority advisor i do not think you are going to perfect however i do expect that you and your chapter members about the values of your organization and use them to guide decisions imagine how much easier it would be to make decisions as executive board if you consistently asked the simple question does this align with friendship sound learning or own it you must be willing to accept responsibility for the of your chapter both past and present noted entrepreneur and jim rohn once said you must take personal responsibility you change the circumstances the seasons or the wind but you can yourself once you decide it is time to own it you can begin process of creating positive enjoy the ride being a chapter president is arguably the difficult leadership position on a college campus you are a model a counselor a mentor an administrator an advisor and spokesperson expectations for chapter presidents are high and should be however many chapter presidents get so caught up in all things to all people that they forget to simply be a sister or brother along with the rest of the responsibilities you have as chapter president it is important for you to remember to have take care of yourself and enjoy the my preference for this blog entry would be for this to be conversation and not just me giving advice of course this is not extensive list of advice for new presidents i am not sure one even be compiled i am interested in hearing from all of you because your voice is the one that truly moe has many years of

a fraternity since our founding years the first the first convention was held just three short years after the of phi delta theta when seven phis met on december at woodruff house in cincinnati at the time there were only chapters in the fraternity while that first convention was different in size and scope from the one we will soon experience purpose was the same to discuss the state of our brotherhood and its from walter b authoritative account the history of delta theta we know that the first convention was conceived in when founder john mcmillan wilson miami wrote to robert morrison

louis as an phi i am pleased to tell you about some customs and traditions that hope you will experience when we gather in washington dc which you to the experiences of previous convention attendees these listed in no particular order or customs and traditions which link us to the convention many decades ago members who attended the general convention the practice of wearing small silver bars to designate the number conventions they had attended these bars when linked resemble ladders as phis attend more conventions the lengthen and provide striking evidence of a phis devotion to fraternity each bar indicates the city and year in which convention took place the phi who has attended the most conventions and has the longest ladder in fraternity history executive vice president emeritus robert j miller new mexico brother miller served as the chief executive for before retiring as executive vice president in in dc brother miller will secure his rd ladder since he has every convention since the centennial convention in while at the convention be sure to take a close look at ladder if asked i bet he may even share a story or two past william morrison great grandson of morrison and robert morrison westminster grandson of morrison visit with robert j miller new mexico who displaying the longest convention ladder in phi delta theta history the convention in opening business session roll think of this as a chapter meeting roll call but larger and impressive during the first business session on friday morning meeting will begin with the traditional roll call of chapters clubs and general officers of the fraternity the roll call conducted by executive vice president robert a biggs georgia and it is always impressive to hear how widespread the is across north america it is especially moving for many when biggs introduces a new phi delta theta chapter to the convention the introduction please welcome to their first biennial name of chapter or a reinstalled chapter with the please welcome back to the fold name of introductions are always special for those undergraduates and who worked especially hard during the biennium to be assist chartering a new chapter and are usually acknowledged enthusiastic executive vice president robert a biggs georgia southern conducts the roll call during the first business session of the convention in memorial one of the most solemn events which takes place during the convention is the conducting of the ritualistic ceremony the ceremony which is open to as well and by many family members and surviving spouses acknowledges

include code committee credentials committee procedure committee nominating appeals committee resolutions committee and wardens committee once committee has reviewed an item under its jurisdiction than it can brought to the convention floor where it will be discussed and necessary voted upon just like in a chapter an undergraduate member of the code committee presents legislation to the convention floor during the convention meet the one of the most important responsibilities of the general convention to elect the five men who will lead the fraternity for the next years as members of the general council the men elected to general council are charged to be the legal representative of fraternity and custodian of the property of the fraternity the council shall interpret and

home chapter while serving an international posted on may by by rich fabritius general my phi delt experience has been filled by the presence of so tremendous volunteers many of them have never gotten a mention in scroll or during a convention but they work hard for our men and alumni brothers day after day been asked to write a fraternity volunteer enriched my experience and my life general my variety of great experiences with many a phi volunteer makes it difficult to comment on one my first contact with the general fraternity was through my president when i was an undergraduate brother george porosky with mercedes benz parked in the street across from the chapter house parking lights on he was a consistent positive presence in chapter patient and ever in control george steered us when we it and let us go when we needed to learn a lesson he hated chapter meetings he thought they were too long an engineer so think some of our ridiculousness was in firm contrast to constitution those meetings were long very long he was right course but they were fun and i remember thinking there was no place on the planet rather be than down in the chapter room sunday nights george is a main figure in my memory of but the volunteer who taught me perhaps my most treasured lesson phi delta theta is brother jim warner jim succeeded george province president of sigma south and prowls the sidelines of ohio for us to this day jim was an adviser at akron with ohio his alma mater just like george when i first met him i was undergraduate and remember meeting him at a kent state now there is a rivalry between akron and kent both and between our chapters so i was a tad perplexed by the presence an at a kent homecoming but when i met jim i quickly that he care about what chapter you were from he about you and he cared about phi delta theta i learned from jim lesson that has led me to this position today on the general i learned that phi delt just about your home chapter and a whole lot more than that i learned that phi delt is international brotherhood not a chapter i learned that you can your home chapter while serving an international brotherhood learned that phi delt is a whole lot bigger than kent university and make no mistake about it i love kent state and never be able to repay jim for the gift he gave me he planted me a curiosity about the larger organization i developed a thirst know our brotherhood beyond the buildings of kent ohio curiosity lead me to intern at the general headquarters which lead employment on the ghq staff while working for ghq i met my wife this day gift returns to me daily i imagine life without phi delta theta i imagine my experience without the deep gratifying experiences had the general fraternity and i imagine being a phi without as my brother mentor and thanks brother fabritius is the general council reporter his other service to phi delt has included education commissioner and president rich lives in atlanta with his

warner kent state phi delta theta fabritius volunteerism leave a comment do i know when a chapter is living the ritual a mom tells posted on march by by scott as phi delta theta helps observe national ritual celebration week i asked to share some thoughts on what it means to live the ritual realize that from time to time i am asked by administrators parents alumni and undergraduate members to give definitive definition of how i know when a chapter is living ritual of phi delta theta and when i think about this question come to the conclusion that i know when a chapter is living the when a mom tells me so now going to come back to this as judge concept a little bit later but let me first share thoughts on being a fraternity man with a capital it would be easy and completely appropriate for me to define the as achieving the highest grades on campus providing tremendous amount of community service hours and raising a lot of for charity holding a lot of campus leadership positions and the ritual in all chapter meetings and functions and while each these specific acts are visible public and measurable and all good activities that i certainly encourage for me they this idea of the as i think about the three cardinal principles of friendship learning and rectitude laid out by our founders years ago in bond of phi delta theta and supported in the ritualistic that are the backbone of our fraternity they describe to me characteristics of my concept of a fraternity i want to return for a minute to the original view and perception fraternity men by the broader society i have always been struck by visual representation of a fraternity man which appeared over a ago this drawing coincided with a gathering of delts years ago in louisville kentucky at the general convention this illustration was printed in the and was the first editorial cartoon about fraternity convention ever published if you look closely at cartoon see that it characterizes the phi delt as somewhat larger broader and with more presence than the man he walking next to this cartoon represent him as a drunk slob or frat guy but as phi man as a man of character leader of men this phi delt have been featured on tfm frat the founders of phi delta theta were respected leaders of their and outlined for all of us a set of simple beliefs and which if followed lead to a life of honor respect and to me living the ritual becomes instinctive internalized and in the creation of lifelong habits and it begins at initiation president of phi delta theta i have had the opportunity of and installing many of our newest chapters and to each new chapter the installation banquet i offer the following when you were initiated and all signed the bond of phi delta you agreed to live your lives by three simple principles sound learning and moral rectitude i charge each of you here remember and honor those commitments to each other i charge the men phi delta theta to excel in the classroom to the best of your to sit in the front of class engage with your professors and to the academic to excel on the athletic field or performance venue always your best performance and exhibiting exemplary sportsmanship to engage on the campus get involved in student government other student organizations to lead not just to engage in the local community and serve those in to not abuse alcohol women or each last but not least to act in such a manner both and individually that all of your mothers fathers alumni friends will take pride in you as a fraternity if you do that you will have met the obligations you made when signed the so back to the mom as judge concept i know a chapter is the ritual when i hear from the parent of a phi which usually out to be the mother who calls or writes to tell me about her experience in the fraternity these messages sound like having never been involved in a fraternity before both my husband i were both very impressed and proud to see these young men filled enthusiasm and dedication the fraternity has been a experience for him and i know there will be a void once he this the brothers missouri eta missouri western were going to anyway but they went beyond a philanthropy project and made it personal for my family tanner who has a disability is almost are trying to accept that he will never be married he will never a car and may never attend college he will never have the to be a phi delta theta these men have embraced my family and me for that i am eternally grateful missouri eta chapter from the of my heart i love each and every one of you you are and caring and will always be a blessing in my i was admittedly apprehensive when he expressed an interest becoming involved with a fraternity our family had no experience fraternities or sororities and i had some of the typical regarding the greek system his father and i gave our approval with caveat that he must maintain a high grade point average and jeopardize his scholarship since he wishes to attend law school graduation i am proud to say that he is beginning his senior year has retained his scholarship for all four years in large part due the scholastic emphasis and support of the fraternity i have been impressed with the level of involvement of the alumni with undergraduates in phi delta theta they are truly committed fostering the development of these young men and certainly stress virtues that we all wish to instill in our sons honor loyalty responsibility personally i can attest to new levels of and maturity in my son that i believe are directly attributable to involvement in phi delta with time i have become less concerned with seeing it in terms formal activities and more interested in understanding that the of living the ritual is taking place within our chapters when i from a parent with a testimonial like these i know the chapter living the so in closing here are a few things i believe members of phi theta do every day to live the we care for one another and lift each other we challenge ourselves individually to be better men every we challenge each other to rise to a higher we call a brother out when he is going down the wrong we turn our backs on a brother in we celebrate each we believe in words like fraternity honor duty leadership brotherhood love and not we take pride in identifying ourselves as fraternity we believe in the lifetime commitments we made to each other we signed the my hope is that all of our brothers do these things that we strive to live the ritual to the best of our abilities because members of phi delta

professional life an advertising guy i work alongside our pr professionals all the as well as practitioners from other agencies fun to work them in building a business building their while there are certainly lessons and observations i can draw upon inform this post in the end i find them a little weightless in context of being a instead i got to thinking about reputations within our fraternity the fraternity world we are very lucky to be phi delts one of the best if not the best reputation in the fraternity today other fraternities envy our organization for a variety reasons our educational programming is among the best out providing our undergrads and alumni volunteers with opportunities for growth and development our undergraduates are the best men walking the hills of college campuses across america our alumni are engaged and give tremendous amounts of talent and treasure to phi delt and most importantly we are willing to make hard decisions for the betterment of the in order to honor and perpetuate the objectives of the immortal other groups envy us because we make hard i personally find strength in the notion that i am a member of organization who is willing to do the right thing which leads me reputation management we owe each other and ourselves the effort be the best we can be to manage our reputations individually and an do you like what you see when you look in the mirror do you feel living up to the challenges of the argue that the best reputation management that can be done making sure you can look yourself in the eye being a phi means better than common and challenging ourselves and our brothers to better than the great thing about phi delt is the expectations are clear and to understand and we know when lived up to the challenge when fallen short falling short is ok falling short means recognize the need for improvement and perhaps some help from brothers in the process what there i was given a book call the edge when i went off to kent state

defense of posted on september by by scott mietchen president of the general as many readers of the phi delta theta blog have discovered this is national hazing prevention week and phi delta theta is doing all can to raise awareness about the issue in the past i have about my own experiences of being hazed hazing others and hazing in my own chapter over the years i have sat on both sides many discussions debating the pros and cons of hazing definitions hazing and hazing activities and the appropriateness and of having a culture of hazing within a chapter i hope that others take the time to share their thoughts on hazing in these that our undergraduate brothers give real thought to the expressed but i know that always the case i know that in many chapters across north america there are a certain number of brothers who simply roll their eyes and make some disparaging about yet another lecture on hazing i know that when leaders some chapters stand up in a meeting and propose the need to end that there can often be loud and vigorous to the concept change from some in the and sometimes i wonder why this continues to be an issue in the movement and why some members feel the need to continue hazing to so not going to here a lecture from me today about why is bad today i am writing to extend a sincere and honest to those who believe hazing makes phi delta theta a better the my challenge today directed at those undergraduate brothers either like hazing or have worked to end hazing in their my challenge today is to those brothers who rolled their eyes when thought this was going to be one more lecture chance for the general council president to yammer on about hazing more time my challenge is to those who fight vigorously effectively to keep hazing traditions in here is my challenge and offer to those the phi delta theta blog has become a very effective communication not only for phi delts but for the larger greek community blog are distributed over the facebook fan page to phis the blog posts are also read by other sorority and higher education leaders across north america many entries are and shared through email lists phi delta blog has become a key source for some of leading thought in and about the greek i am offering access to the phi delta theta blog to one member who can write a powerful thoughtful and well reasoned of hazing but there are some parameters and the rules and this is a real this offer is limited to current phi delta theta initiated members it is not open to alumni or the author must write an essay defending which the fraternity will run on the phi delta theta blog next writers can read other blog posts to determine an appropriate the essay does not need to deal with the legality or illegality the essay must discuss at a minimum the following why hazing should be allowed in phi delta why hazing helps create stronger why hazing helps us live up to the principles outlined in the why hazing is philosophically morally and ethically why hazing helps build better analyze and defend the ratio of hazing given that hazing activities have lead to harm injury or even death in cases to those seeking to join greek the essay cannot use the following the military does it they are professionally others do it the why i mom mom just defend why it is good for the betterment of phi in the essay you parse words or hazing activities this not a defense of whether or not doing interviews to meet the brothers or having house chores etc is hazing this needs to written as a defense of the benefits of hazing and the positive nature of things such as but not limited night time or any other big brother night with liquor pressure to consume wall sits calisthenics wearing funny clothes and pranks and eating gross or bad food sleep kangaroo courts or other mental late night runs swims servitude activities for older you get the picture in other words use your essay debate and argue for whether or not getting signatures is a good bad thing keep it intellectually honest and focused on the that everyone would understand as it must be understood that your essay if selected will published under your name anonymity be accepted we all need be willing to publically stand by our how it will be i will reach out to others in the fraternity for their input but will take responsibility for choosing the is a winner in short the answer is no if no essay is submitted that follows rules and parameters or follow the common rules of logic there will be no winning entry however if a essay is submitted then yes there will be a winner have to agree with what the brother writes it just needs to well written argued and neither you or your chapter will be disciplined for submitting an as general council president i offer my word that no brother submits an entry will be subject to discipline by the general or general headquarters i also offer my word that any entry will result in an investigation into activities in your chapter as a of an essay submission for those who know me you know that i by my word this is not a trick or trap this is a sincere only true believers in the benefits of hazing need the purpose of this challenge is not to encourage a brother to write essay defending a point of view they may not believe it this looking for someone to be a advocate this is a challenge those who believe that the effort to hazing is simply wrong and that hazing should be allowed to take in phi delta if you win hand you the fraternity a winning essay will have two significant opportunities to make the case about the benefits of the winning essay will run on the phi delta theta blog reaches well over people in october the writer of the winning essay will receive an trip to st louis in january as my guest

phi delta theta blog not long the why this in some ways this challenge harkens back to the early days of fraternity when a great deal of time was spent in chapter debating the significant issues of the day this was how the members of phi delta theta developed their minds analytical skills persuasive debating talents this is where phis learned to take position defend an idea and become a phi delta theta has taken an active stance against hazing for decades and yet it continues in far too many places i can only conclude it continues because there remain active believers in its practice well as defenders of its continuing use there must be phis who believe phi delta efforts to end hazing are wrong if delta theta is wrong in working to eradicate hazing than it would much better to bring the debate out in the public light and let it the scrutiny of active supreme court justice william o douglas once wrote the way to noxious ideas is with other ideas the way to combat falsehoods with this is an opportunity for defenders of hazing to make their case the phi delt nation that phi delta theta should reconsider our on the i encourage phis who have brothers in their chapters who defend protect hazing practices to share this challenge with those and encourage them to submit an essay it be acceptable defend hazing behind closed doors but not be willing to make a defense for its use in our phikeia education i think it is clear where i and the entire general council stand and have stood for many years personally i believe our effort to end hazing is the right decision for phi delta however i also understand that not all brothers may not agree this position it is those brothers i challenge today with genuine offer of challenging the current position microphone is brother

prevention week phi delta theta scott mietchen comments invitation to nfl commissioner roger goodell please join us in to stop posted on august by by scott mietchen general council hazing as the international president of phi delta theta i that anytime i say or write this word many of our members undergraduate and alumni roll their eyes and expect to hear another lecture on the litany of reasons why hazing has no place in greek movement in general or in our fraternity specifically this piece directed at the members of phi delta theta it is directed at one of the most powerful thoughtful and men in the world of sports roger goodell the commissioner of national football you see while the words fraternity and hazing are often together the problem of hazing exists in many areas of our including professional college and high school athletics i refuse accept the common perception that hazing is just a problem in fact i believe that fraternities and sororities and their respective chapters do more try and combat hazing then any organizations i can think of i that the greek system gets most of the focus and i realize we have to completely end these practices within our own organizations though we have been waging the fight against hazing for however we greeks cannot combat hazing alone without key joining with us to end these stupid pointless harmful and dangerous traditions in fact it makes it more difficult for us combat hazing in our own ranks when the media celebrates acts hazing in shows such as the hbo series hard knocks where humorously profiled hazing in the nfl this past that is why i was so pleased to read this past week that jack del head coach of the jacksonville jaguars has banned hazing this from the jaguars rookie training camp after things got out of hand coach del rio defended his decision by saying that needed to have more respect for each other in order to be teammates and with his simple order hazing stopped in the training camp and just this week jason garrett head coach of dallas cowboys followed suit with a similar ban for his for a coach to take this step in the nfl is important because it trickle down to other nfl teams and then into collegiate and school athletics ask any high school athlete coach or referee hazing and you will hear some incredible stories you can google high school sports hazing and read an astonishing number deplorable stories the nfl serves as a role model to high school collegiate athletes whether it accepts the role or not and hazing is accepted and even celebrated in the nfl it makes it acceptable at the high school and collegiate levels by students that hazing is an acceptable i am asking nfl commissioner roger goodell for help last i wrote commissioner goodell a letter asking for his leadership addressing hazing in the nfl and offering as help phi delta years of experience in fighting the issue that request for help the commissioner and offer of assistance by our fraternity today the nfl sets the tone for many norms in our society and players coaches and owners do indeed serve as role models for youth their leadership on any issue can make a difference leadership to join the fight against hazing just might even save at the time i wrote commissioner goodell last fall there were other things on his plate including the recently completed talks between the players and owners those talks are now the players are back in training camp and the nfl will most likely another record breaking season unfortunately the commissioner an opportunity to ban hazing with the recently completed bargaining while i realize that there is much the office throughout the year on a wide variety of issues i would hope that may see the steps recently taken by the jaguars and cowboys as opportunity to use his position of leadership to begin stamping hazing in the nfl his actions now may help lead to the elimination hazing in other levels of sports which can also help us in our against hazing commissioner goodell has the unilateral ability draw the line in the sand regarding behavioral standards in the nfl authority he has used in the past to deal with other issues which viewed as a threat to the league its players i believe commissioner has the decency to take a stand that can affect of young men and women who may never play in his league and beyond illegality of hazing in many states just stupid wrong not suggesting that we blame hazing within our organization on nfl far from it phi delta theta will continue its to stamp out hazing in our own organization regardless of what do however i am suggesting that the active and vocal leadership commissioner goodell on this issue could impact many parts of for decades to commissioner goodell you have the ability to unilaterally stop in the nfl all it takes from you is the stroke of a pen consider joining us in this effort as it will have very consequences far beyond the gates of the national football

management tagged dallas hazing jack del rio jacksonville jaguars garrett national football league nfl phi delta roger goodell rookies comments street shutter fraternities for young faulty logic and wrong posted on april by by scott mietchen general council i am writing as the international president of phi delta fraternity to express my surprise that such a international publication as the wall street journal would allow a weakly argued article as shutter fraternities for young good to appear on its news pages while the piece could certainly been written as an oped piece expressing the personal point of view it appeared in a section reserved news items in my view the writer exhibited journalistic and logic standards and did a tremendous disservice to millions of current undergraduate alumni members who have exemplary fraternity experiences please let me first let me state that what happened to ms seccuro as undergraduate at the university of virginia years ago is horrible and beyond explanation or excuse and i hope the was appropriately punished but however horrible this event was i agree it was horrible it was not caused because a fraternity at the university of virginia for the same reason that it did happen because the university of virginia is coeducational happened because the young men involved did not know the boundaries they legal moral or ethical between right and the author ms flanagan writes the greek system is dedicated quelling young anxiety about submitting themselves to four of book learning by providing them with a variety of activities drinking drugging espn watching and the mistreatment of women i could not disagree with ms flanagan about her broad and untrue characterization of fraternity men this simply not a description of fraternity life that i recognize as i believe her article commits one of the classic logical fallacies confusing association with as the president of phi delta theta fraternity with nearly undergraduate members and alumni members located in chapters over north american campuses i can state unequivocally that characterization of what we are dedicated to is just wrong and based on a stereotypical view often times reinforced in media through movies such as animal house time to put house to rest a movie nothing more not reality i also state unequivocally that i have never heard of any other or international fraternity dedicated to the activities described in the the vast majority of fraternity men i know do not fit the description at all the men i know serve as campus leaders academic success in the classroom take part in academic graduate at higher levels than men move on to or professional schools at higher levels excel on the athletic or artistic venue and serve their communities this may play a role in explaining why fraternity men generally have a great deal pride and affection for their fraternity as well as i sadly have to agree with ms assessment that abuse alcohol is a significant problem on college campuses today and i have to agree that surveys reveal that this problem can fraternity populations at a higher level than the general body i also agree that abuse of alcohol plays a significant role both men and women in many of the challenges facing today whether it be sexual harassment or abuse academic issues or harmful interpersonal the entire greek movement fraternities and sororities working our partners in higher education has been working to educate members and stem the abuse of alcohol for many years each of the than fraternities has developed own approaches for addressing this serious issue i applaud all these proactive efforts for phi delta theta in addition to education programs we have taken the approach of creating housing and removing alcohol from our chapter houses for the decade for our organization this has worked for fraternities other approaches have i wish that all fraternity chapters across north america offered exemplary experience but that would be dishonest unfortunately chapters have lost their way and digressed from the values around they were created it is then up to each fraternity to hold chapters accountable to the values and beliefs of their organizations i believe most fraternities work to hold individual chapters accountable i know that phi delta theta committed to upholding our founding principles of friendship learning and fraternities have existed and thrived on north american campuses nearly two centuries we have our issues that we continue to and we have never claimed to be perfect however as a former university administrator i would argue that fraternities sororities continue to provide an invaluable learning experience complements the classroom experience and that we continue to the best real life leadership learning laboratory on a as the father of two children one a daughter who is in her junior of high school and just beginning the college search process and other a junior high school son i have to admit that i am proud to that i not only believe in the continuing relevance and importance fraternity and sorority system but that i enthusiastically encourage both my son and daughter to consider if is right for them for phi delta theta we have had a chapter at university of virginia since and have a great deal of pride in accomplishments and characteristics of the men that comprise chapter at i think it is unfortunate that the author would take such a personal experience and use it to demonize and categorize the more undergraduate men as well as millions of alumni who belong college fraternal organizations in north america we all corporate employees for the unethical actions of a few we fire all of the faculty of a university because one plagiarizes thesis we cancel all professional sports because some broke the rules and took drugs we down all organizations because one operated in an manner it just how we do this is the story of a despicable rape and its aftermath not a about fraternities a sound argument is a valid argument with premises this article provided neither please use poor and lack of facts to paint all of us

filed under phi delt general council phi delt volunteers tagged liz seccuro phi delta theta scott wall street journal comments journey from being hazed to being an enthusiastic hazer posted on september by by scott mietchen general council this week serves as national hazing prevention week and as council president i was asked to write about why hazing has no in phi delta theta while it would be easy for me to simply repeat greek mantra outlining the evils of hazing in order discredit hazing practices i wanted to use this opportunity to tell own story with hazing and why i feel so strongly about the need bring an end to these practices you see as a phikeia i was as a new initiate i was an active and enthusiastic hazer as a officer i stopped hazing in our chapter this is a bit of my being i pledged phi delta theta at the university of utah in the fall this was just a few years after the release of animal house i was the poster child for the target market for greek life at the i was the consummate joiner i was bound and determined to involved on campus and even though i come from a background i saw fraternity life as the way to immediately involved on this large public university campus going through rush was split between three fraternities at the end of a very formal week period and ultimately decided to pledge phi delta theta because liked the laid back real and friendly nature of the guys i met guys made me feel welcome and soon after our official pledge ceremony we held our first meeting and were given the requirements to complete in order to initiated our requirements included the usual items read and the phikeia manual meet and learn something about all of the organize a community service event organize a social with a pledge class etc the chapter officers also told us that the pledge as identified by the chapter brothers would be recognized initiation with the low bond number of the pledge class competitive i was determined to earn that low bond now i expected some fun and games throughout my pledge because i had seen them in the movies and i figured they were simply rite of passage that i could tolerate and survive my ultimate however was to earn the low bond number and i worked diligently to that top pledge i played the role to the best of my abilities completed my assignments early i mastered facts about the i met with all of the active brothers i maintained a attitude and i adopted the attitude of grin and bear it through hazing hazing in my chapter extremely physical it primarily mental with some minor physical activities included i paddled forced to do calisthenics or consume massive amounts alcohol or dropped off in the dessert somewhere blindfolded and to walk back for me it was more subtle line ups late night sessions servitude yelling demeaning remarks surprise kangaroo courts etc and i excelled at all of it i could recite greek alphabet backwards and forwards before the match burned finger i could stand with a spotlight in my face at am while being yelled and cursed at by the wimpiest guy in chapter who also happened to be fairly inebriated i could say sir faster than almost anyone and mean it i could memorize poems used to address the brothers as well as to answer the phone knew that i could put up with anything because i wanted to be and i wanted that low bond when it came time for initiation or i put up with a lot wore the dumb clothes ate the horrible food carried items campus gave up sleep lived in squalor and continued to endure games mental hazing included those exercises where we were lead believe we be initiated or that our entire pledge class was failure after five days of sleep deprivation spotlights poor food mind games physical stress and threats i have to admit began to wonder if it was all worth it then just as quickly as started it was over and i was initiated however i am sad to say remember much of my own initiation i was simply too tired mentally frayed to pay attention when initiation starts at and ends at am and occurs after five days of hell there little to remember or cherish i was simply in survival mode but the end i had survived and achieved my goal i had been named best pledge and was rewarded with the low bond number in my class it felt great the pledge program had made me a great unfortunately i had also developed some real enmity toward several the brothers and younger alumni who were the most aggressive hazers the chapter i put on a smile in their presence but i developed respect for them and to this day i have no desire to with them at alumni events i always thought it odd that i had a collection of miscellaneous facts and figures about the fraternity but i had not learned very much about what makes for a strong however i rationalized that perhaps learning about running the too important and once i was initiated i wait have my turn to haze the next pledge class now it was my and now it was my turn to be a not long after being initiated we took our spring pledge class part of my own pledge program i had read the prohibiting hazing it was printed right in the phikeia manual but had bought into the tradition and rite of passage rationales think anything bad would happen it was during the first class after mine that i became a great hazer i could demand play mental games and demean the pledges with the best of them the worst hazer but i held my own not proud of the that i could get in a face at am and yell at because he know how many bricks there were in old north dorm believed that if they really wanted to be phis they needed to earn and that this was just part of the path to membership after all had come through just fine and it was by now i was also on the executive committee and had to learn more about the policies i met first chapter consultant from general headquarters and engaged in heated debate with him about what was and was not hazing i to focus on the specific aspects that made an activity a activity because it made for an endless debate however i could quite bring myself to truthfully evaluate whether it was morally ethically right or wrong quite frankly at the time i thought policies were just set by a bunch of general officers who really know what was happening at the at the same time my pledge class had taken on several key positions and decided to try and really upgrade our chapter and some fraternity awards however to do this we knew we needed to something about our pledge program or perhaps we could just about some of our most cherished traditions in our awards why i stopped the the next fall my sophomore year we took a fairly large pledge and our pledge program contained the same hazing traditions and of passage from previous years and i participated as however this time something happened that changed my our phikeia class had completed their pledge program and was for initiation week it was at this point that one of our keith started to become quiet he had always been somewhat but now it was becoming more pronounced our initiation lasted five days with formal initiation on the last evening the first four days of keith became progressively withdrawn more reserved and more quiet quite frankly several of sleep deprivation stress and mental hazing had dimmed the spark his eyes and we started to get having finished the fun of we were preparing the pledge for their formal initiation except that we had a problem when we to get keith for the initiation ceremony we found him in his curled up in the corner of the pledge room rocking back and forth humming he was he had simply gone beyond his for emotional stress and lack of sleep and was now nearly we were able to get keith to his feet and literally helped him each step of the entire initiation ceremony with one brother on arm whispering in his ears the words he was to repeat we were for keith and scared for ourselves toward the end of the when keith realized that he had been initiated his mental started to improve since the emotional stress of the past five days begun to dissipate however as active members we were concerned for safety and for his reaction and to truthful we were terrified that the chapter would get into we persuaded keith to stay at the chapter house for an additional days after initiation so he could sleep and return to a normal state mind which he did however it was then and there that i saw dangers and banality of hazing on that day i and several of pledge brothers made the commitment to end hazing in our chapter had come with the fact that hazing funny entertaining and it can be very stopping hazing i discovered a very simple truth in our fight to end hazing most the brothers in the chapter really like hazing they just along with it because it was tradition except for a small number hardcore hazers and they were hardcore there was very little against stopping the hazing as officers we simply said no hazing and for the most part hazing ended it discussions at ten chapter meetings or a chapter task force anything else it simply took leaders standing up and saying no hazing hazing is defined as any action taken or situation intentionally or unintentionally whether with or without the of the persons subjected to that action which produces mental physical discomfort embarrassment harassment or generally individuals within chapters with hazing cultures of age or status have the same common reply when asked about practices heard the excuses for years and i can tell you experience that they are simply no one will get funny the they like it they said it was okay if they it helps build team cohesiveness and i went through it a rite of one person can stop some may read this and think there they go again one of those national guys preaching to us again about hazing and you know i would understand that mentality because i felt the same way at time but i would ask you to consider for just a minute the morals safety and potential disasters that might occur should program of hazing go wrong i would ask you to consider if you be so resolute in your opinions if you or your chapter damaged or even lost a brother i would ask you to consider would all be worth it for the sake of tradition i would hope you be so nonchalant in ignoring all of the advice and help available you to end hazing in your if your chapter has a hazing problem i ask you as a brother consider taking just one step please consider being that phi who stands up says no more and stops the hazing your chapter become a better place because of your the an amazing thing happened once we stopped the hazing and improved phikeia education program our chapter got remarkably better we in numbers academics quality chapter operations and several years after these changes took hold my chapter went on to some of the most prestigious awards some of my most loyal and active alumni today come from the pledge classes were spared the indignities of hazing and to this day keith one of my best friends he and his wife have raised a great family he remains a loyal and active phi and as i write this i realize beyond that initiation week nearly years ago he and i have talked about this probably something we would all just please remember and consider hazing proud to be a brother mietchen is the general council

http://www.tinius.com/en/annual_reports/annual_report_2010/The+Necessity+of+Innovation.9UFRnOZr.ips the necessity of innovation stiftelsen report back to httpaddr and necessity of innovation by christian printzell ceo of and creativity the rate of innovation will increase dramatically if we strengthen commitment to innovation i am confident that we have both an and a golden future the necessity of organization has to prepare for the abandonment of everything peter innovation is not new to schibsted in the founder of the christian schibsted faced a particularly demanding challenge he a printing press and had lost his major customer the daily aftenbladet the solution to the problem was as simple as it ingenious create the customer by making your own newspaper classical example of value chain innovation was the start aftenposten at present biggest newspaper and the media group as we know it today per cent of revenues come from online placing the group right at the top in world ranking figures in comparable media companies lie around per success in this comes from letting online operations finn vgno and aftonbladetse operate on their own terms and to extent compete with their parent companies while in many countries new players often from backgrounds other than media taken the leading positions in the online media market the media group has succeeded in the same strong in digital as in however the game about the future continues the speed of is on the increase and the outlook is gloomy for those who are to renew themselves over a period of time as implied in the quotation by peter drucker my contention is clear you can cut and streamline businesses to obtain profitability but not history shows how very few companies manage to be innovative over a period of time to survive dramatic changes in technology society these kinds of changes create new rules of play and thus new winners having the best and most efficient steam locomotives not help much when the world switched to electric at finn we have worked in a structured manner with innovation in we were rated the best workplace in norway but even we still have a long way to go before crossing the finishing line would like to share some of our experiences hopefully this inspire someone to embark on a similar innovation process however we need an understanding of what innovation is and of basic challenges facing companies working with innovation and invention are not the the words innovation and invention are sometimes used synonymously they differ in two distinct areas the degree of novelty commercialisation on the one hand we have inventions ie products created from scratch without necessarily becoming products most inventions are created in research on the other hand we have innovations these are commercial created by making new combinations of existing products creating for the users the word innovation comes from the latin word meaning to renew or we can therefore say that innovation the process of renewing something already in existence innovation occurs in a commercial context in contrast to let us look at an example apple iphone was it an invention no innovation definitely the technology of iphone had been available years gps camera touch screen motion sensors wireless network mobile internet what apple did was to use these technologies in a new form with broad user appeal the fact that actually used a poorer technology than its competitors in the version of iphone did not prevent it from being a huge when we hear the word innovation most of us think of new products in the example of iphone product innovation is however just one of innovation according to the consultancy firm doblin involved innovation there are four categories of innovation chain delivery and process most innovations are a combination of the value chain innovation of christian schibsted has been already nespresso is another example whereby succeeds obtaining a coffee price which is ten times higher than the price ordinary coffee this was done in three simple steps high quality product exclusive right to supply coffee for machines practical delivery of coffee to the home of the so the power lies in combining value chain innovation innovation and delivery still the last type of innovation process innovation should not ignored a company standing out in this field is which real time warehouse logistics is able to react to market considerably quicker than their competitors was in largest listed it is beyond doubt that successful innovation generates value let us look at why this is still so the why is it that long established and resourceful companies struggle innovation there are many who have tried to understand this hamel hailed by the wall street journal as the influential business thinker puts it like this most companies built for continuous improvement instead of disruptive innovation know how to get better but not how to be different i believe he a good point clay christensen professor at harvard enjoying a as an authority on disruptive innovation is one of those who in book dilemma has worded the challenge best he that the distinguishing characteristic of a disruptive innovation that it gives totally new consumer segments access to a new product a new service which historically was reserved for those either a lot of money or innovations like these are often characterised by the cost being completely changed turning the competition around this frequently results in free or almost free products and the other distinguishing characteristic is that the products services are often of poorer quality than those of the market and are therefore being aimed at new customer segments the result this is that a number of companies do not them as competitors the challenge lies however in that the improves quickly to something good enough for most people established players often respond with quality improvement but too late they also often forget that this type of improvements has declining return in customer value and that they risk being left a golden product with a very high cost base which no one or very are willing to pay let us take a look at a couple of examples from the world of traditional media houses have high cost bases and are focusing on quality editorial products they have proficient news desks and efficient apparatus for printing and distribution in the bloggers they work for free publishing platforms such wordpress are free global distribution on google facebook and is free most people will however consider the content to be poorer quality than that of journalists the target group is from the target groups of media houses this may turn out to be classical example of disruptive innovation ie players with a different cost structure turning to a new customer segment but happens when the blog quality approaches the quality of our news is it possible to respond with better journalistic products or have reached the level of good enough and if so what happens then know the one last example is youtube currently the largest service on the internet it all started with user generated videos poor quality which could be viewed on the computer could it described as a competitor to tv channels and tv distributors still the quality of youtube is getting better fast you can now content in hd quality from professional players with easy access mobile phone ipad and increasingly on tv can this become competition with time innovative organisations not innovative it is my contention that structured innovation is possible the to the innovation challenge is not to employ more creative people to systemise innovation this is the way to be successful in innovative organisations and it is far more effective than dependent on creative at finn we began working with innovation in and we still a long way from reaching our goal from the start in we experienced a considerable annual growth at the same time realised that there was a limit to how much growth we could unless we took action even more important when we as a part of target management summed up all known growth initiatives we that there was a gap between them and the ambitions of the the answer to filling the gap was innovation consequently we had believe that it was possible to create something new and unknown order to reach our the work with innovation at finn is based on six principles which have identified in leading companies in the field of top management prioritises innovation as core strong user and customer culture for growth and systematic process for finding and implementing incentives supporting in the following i will describe how we interpreted and complied these principles i hope this can be an inspiration to others but would like to emphasise that this is only one way of thinking are probably just as many other good ways of approaching this top management prioritises innovation for innovation to successful it is essential that the top management is committed question of innovation is too important to be delegated to others finn i as general manager and the entire management team are figures when it comes to innovation innovation is one of three of focus this pervades the management team as well as the agenda the organisation i estimate that more than half of the time is spent discussing innovation in one way or it is possible to see what is important in an organisation listening at finn there is a lot of talk of growth and personally i spend a lot of time talking about it both outside we have for example open meetings on a monthly basis innovation often is the main topic and where employees with consensus often present innovative ideas which they been working however commitment at the top means more than just talking it means action i visit the product development teams at finn on regular basis and hear what they are doing learn from them and them encouraging and constructive feedback of course we celebrate when we reach our innovation targets often with layer for everybody in the these are only examples but the main point is that innovation must on the agenda of the top innovation as core competence to all new staff members i say are all innovators regardless of function or position innovation is one of three areas of focus at finn the entire staff faced with this challenge to ensure that innovation is core for everyone and that we continually develop our innovation we have established a separate unit responsible for innovation unit is not responsible itself for implementation but for the of innovation and it is organised as a part of our focus organisational development and continuous improvement this makes easy to see where in the organisation we need to strengthen innovation competence and initiate support measures either in the of assistance or formal training examples of support are creative workshops the challenge of the month and courses creative strong user and customer insight innovation takes place in interface between organisation and market in order to succeed it vital to have an extensive understanding of the needs of customers users expressed and alike closeness to the market those working with innovation and product development is important finn we have tried to resolve this in a number of different first how we are organised we are organised in units placing customers and users in the centre instead of traditional professional silos such as product development development marketing and sales finn eiendom is focusing on and users of the real estate market the same way finn reise is on travel etc not only do the units of product development and report in the same line they also sit next to each other it is my firm belief that this breaks down communication creates a common understanding and common goals the product see and hear what the sales people are up to and vice versa it it easier for those working on the product to get feedback customer meetings and the sales people know more of what is going in product development all in all this creates more customer and but this kind of ad hoc insight and understanding is not enough also has to be structured we have established dedicated units at working with user experience and analysis they assist the development teams in carrying out surveys we have developed a menu of insight tools a taste of insight from where you can choose a tool according to situation and the need we make use of questionnaire surveys interviews user tests and the eye tracking it is how much information you can get out of a user test on a sketch of a product even long before you have started to think finally we involve the customers and users in the product directly we have established close cooperation with our customers in the different market segments early in the process we show them product sketches and get feedback we also have website finn labs where we post sketches and prototypes to feedback from our most avid users in addition to the surveys these measures are instrumental to us being able to the course at an early stage thus saving both time and money but importantly it creates good commercial products that people want culture of growth and innovation the title of the chapter innovation at finn is innovative organisations not the essence of this is that many win over few i believe that an organisation where all the employees take part innovation will be much stronger and more successful than organisation where this is restricted to a small to be successful in this we must create a culture promoting growth innovation at finn this is embedded in the vision together we the best market place as well as in the company values precision headroom and high spirits already in the vision it established that we shall create something and this is supported the values hunger means that we must set high and ambitious precision means that we must exploit customer and user headroom means transparency and that we must listen to the ideas others it also means that we must create a secure environment mistakes are permitted after all most innovations do not succeed punish unsuccessful ideas will create a fear of trying new which is the opposite of what we want finally high spirits mean working with innovation should be finnopp is a tool made to support the culture of open everyone working at finn has access to finnopp and everyone encouraged to contribute you can enter big and small ideas you comment and develop the ideas of others and you can give kudos a of thumbs up for the ideas you like particularly well finnopp become a busy online community where you can view new that have popped up in the last few days or browse through the than ideas in the database here you can see which ideas are most popular which are being developed and which have just launched to customers and finnopp has been a huge success creating a lot of publicity motivation more than per cent of our employees have been in finnopp one way or another it is particularly inspiring to see extensiveness of the material and that not all of it has come those working with product development on a daily basis as a matter fact customer service is one of the units that has contributed most which is only natural when you think of it they are facing customers every day hearing what could have been done better differently they have finally found a channel where this insight being focused and they have found their rightful although our innovation system has been a success i would still like caution those who believe that creating a system is the answer to challenge of innovation it is not however if the six principles have mentioned are in place an innovation system might be rewarding and a useful supportive systematic process for finding and implementing ideas those of who have followed my reasoning so far will understand that is the basis of innovation thinking at finn the tool finnopp is only meant to be a database of ideas it is as much a tool to our innovation process this process consists of three phases create ideas realise ideas and commercialise it lies in the nature of innovation that not all ideas should realised only the best ones thus ideas must be created on a scale it is our experience that there must be someone to drive process forward particularly in the beginning we have for initiated two annual competitions to motivate people to submit ideas we have however also seen that the process after a while thus not requiring the same degree dedicated effort simple measures such as making it possible to thoughts instead of idea have lowered the threshold and taken level of activity at finnopp to new the second phase of the process is to realise the ideas at finnopp realise just over per cent of the submitted ideas a number we relatively pleased with it is however worth mentioning that ideas waiting to be addressed are a challenge in to expectations good communication skills will be required most of the developments at finn come about by normal development with a product manager responsible for a particular selecting ideas and realising them with his own resources we however also experimented with an alternative way of realising ideas giving a venture fund with new money the opportunity to invest in ideas receiving most kudos from the employees this has resulted completely different ideas being prioritised and turned out to quite challenging in this area we quite cracked the code but we are working on finally with regard to commercialising ideas we have already on some elements in this connection for instance development to ensure technically good solutions while at the same creating products possible to commercialise i believe management to be another element an idea is either successful and so the experience gained should be communicated to other areas or it is a failure and if so it should be the search engine sesam is an example of an unsuccessful innovation the history of schibsted media group with sesam schibsted was to compete with google and the yellow pages but realised that battle was lost after having spent mnok on it a failed effort not necessarily a total waste and certainly not if we are able learn from it and make use of this learning in connection with ideas one of the most significant findings in connection with was that it will be a great challenge for major catalogue players google and the yellow pages to respond to a disruptive tender because this will cannibalise enormous catalogue revenues like phoenix bird rising from the ashes of sesam finn oppdrag our effort in emerges focusing on tendering services for it remains to be seen whether we will incentives supporting innovation the last element which must into place to support an innovation effort is incentives at finn have established finn awards an annual gala event at which prizes awarded to the best prizes awarded at finn awards are the prizes for the best the developer of the year the innovator of the year and the prize the winners can get anything from an evening on the town the innovation prize amounting to nok though this is considerable amount of money i still believe the attention given the winners to be the most important it creates a culture innovation and shows that we are a company valuing a world with an increasing rate of innovation will offer in this article i have tried to share with you some of our with structured innovation but i would once again like to that this is in no way the final answer for everyone other with other business cultures must do it differently still i hope problems with adaption prevent anyone from diving in and on with it to my mind it is possible to create organisations in any this will not be any less important in the time to come on contrary the are signs that the rate of innovation is globally it took years for radio to reach million americans tv it took years and for the internet it took four years it facebook three years and eight months to reach million people after seven years it has close to million users the time for responding is getting shorter all the there are primarily two reasons for the increasing rate of a technological development making it cheaper simpler and to build up new services and products the emergence of an middle class in the third the traditional barriers to entry present in most industries are being erased on the internet through the source anyone wanting free access to development tools and building blocks for new products gets it building blocks are available through the web amazon offers storage and services facebook does not only offer identity and a but also free distribution to all the million users of the google offers maps and apple offers payment options through a store solution all in all this makes it relatively simple to new and very powerful services with a minimum of the other developing trend in society which i believe will affect innovation rate is the changes taking place in the third countries at present only a fifth of the total population of world is online there are today many who have not had the to get an education so what will happen when billions of intelligent people are educated and go online there is no doubt in mind that the rate of innovation will increase dramatically in years to do we in scandinavia have anything to offer in this global picture think so according an insead survey of the most innovative in the world the scandinavian countries are all among the top this is an excellent starting point at the same time i think the has come to strengthen our commitment to innovation nationally as as in the individual company if we do that i am confident that have both an exciting and a golden future desire for change by ole jacob the will to be best

mean that more time necessarily the the report released by education sector last month reviews on how schools are using increased learning time mandated by federal government the variations are adding minutes to school day to providing afterschool programs shortening and lunch some approaches show clear potential while others considerable limits to as sensible as using existing time differently sounds its often fall well short of the mark the study says many schools proposing to gain time for instruction by decreasing time namely lunch recess or the time allotted for students to between classes by doing so off the clock warns they are technical compliance with federal rules instead of the hard work comprehensive the report notes that schools that have succeeded with extended have done so largely because they include time as part of a comprehensive reform it reviews successful models including tasc new york citizen schools in boston and the providence after alliance in rhode new designs for extended time should be a part of the improvement plans the report concludes but policymakers and leaders must recognize that successful schools use time not just extend hours and days

by moe stephens general council in case you heard the united states just finished a significant process election time for me always comes with emotions of excitement for potential change or fear of the same as university administrator all of the election coverage also got me think about the election process for fraternities and sororities north america many of you are electing new executive boards and be feeling many of the same emotions i described if you are running for or have recently been elected president your chapter the task before you is likely intimidating exciting full of the i must preface the following with the realization that i am by no an expert in fraternity and sorority life i am well versed and many experiences in this area but it is such a dynamic that i believe you are the experts because you are living that being said i often meet with new presidents and i provide following communicate authentically there are so many different groups a chapter president must communicate with it can be hard remember whom you have brought into the loop if you are what i call authentic communication it matter everyone are bringing to the table will have the same information it require you to be honest with both yourself and your authentic communication is not always the easiest course of action i guarantee you it will only help when the fecal matter hits oscillating device the more trust you have developed with your constituent groups the easier it will be to work through the before you are now living in the fishbowl the phi delta theta chapter the university of washington has a large glassed in dining area call the fishbowl the sidewalk and street right outside are travelled with students and community members passing by the eats there holds social events there and often has special in the fishbowl i have always thought it was great that the could see into the daily life of a phi delt at uw however i also thought about how difficult that might be at times the chapter does in that room is visible and anyone passing by draw their own conclusions about what is happening as a president you are now living in that fishbowl your actions and are being seen and heard often by people you are not even aware watching and listening you are setting an example for your and broadcasting a message to the rest of your community make sure is the right example be certain it is the right make good choices i often end meetings with the phrase make choices outside of the context of sorority and fraternity life simple phrase is much more difficult and open to interpretation as member of a fraternity or sorority it is actually very simple and live the ritual of your organization within your ritual values that are relevant and have withstood the changing times as ed king stated in his classic piece the secret thoughts of because i am a system of values i am therefore an instrument of evaluation my values are clear and absolute and yet difficult emulate to state a few i am honor courage integrity courtesy and i demand self control as well as ambition and what your founders did is take the idea of friendship and move it significant step forward to the concept of commitment as fraternity and sorority advisor i do not think you are going to perfect however i do expect that you and your chapter members about the values of your organization and use them to guide decisions imagine how much easier it would be to make decisions as executive board if you consistently asked the simple question does this align with friendship sound learning or own it you must be willing to accept responsibility for the of your chapter both past and present noted entrepreneur and jim rohn once said you must take personal responsibility you change the circumstances the seasons or the wind but you can yourself once you decide it is time to own it you can begin process of creating positive enjoy the ride being a chapter president is arguably the difficult leadership position on a college campus you are a model a counselor a mentor an administrator an advisor and spokesperson expectations for chapter presidents are high and should be however many chapter presidents get so caught up in all things to all people that they forget to simply be a sister or brother along with the rest of the responsibilities you have as chapter president it is important for you to remember to have take care of yourself and enjoy the my preference for this blog entry would be for this to be conversation and not just me giving advice of course this is not extensive list of advice for new presidents i am not sure one even be compiled i am interested in hearing from all of you because your voice is the one that truly moe has many years of progressive leadership and success in affairs he has traveled the country working for phi delta theta both a leadership consultant and as the director of expansion moe his wife allison and their daughter maya are enjoying the northwest where moe is the assistant director of student activities the university of puget sound moe was the aflv greek advisor the year in moe has a passion for the

biennial general convention where customs link us to the posted on june by by scott mietchen general council in just a few weeks phis from across north america will gather in capital for the th biennial convention will be the fourth time that we have met in the capital city for such meeting the other times being in and in this summer we are continuing a tradition of meeting on a interval as a fraternity since our founding years the first the first convention was held just three short years after the of phi delta theta when seven phis met on december at woodruff house in cincinnati at the time there were only chapters in the fraternity while that first convention was different in size and scope from the one we will soon experience purpose was the same to discuss the state of our brotherhood and its from walter b authoritative account the history of delta theta we know that the first convention was conceived in when founder john mcmillan wilson miami wrote to robert morrison miami what can be done as to holding a at say cincinnati next christmas holidays or what do you advise the matter the suggestion was carried out when in november wilson wrote to morrison who was in tennessee at the time convention will be held between christmas and day cincinnati the minutes of ohio alpha for december report order to transact some business of a general nature a motion by unanimous voice to call a convention to be represented by graduate and undergraduate members of the several colleges of order to meet on tuesday morning dec messrs ross and harrison were appointed to report to the convention feasibility of establishing other chapters of fdth the meeting on december st first organized itself by electing is miami president and benjamin harrison miami following the convention benjamin harrison john mcmillan wilson lw ross were appointed to communicate the proceedings of convention to the existing in at the first convention seven undergraduate and alumni gathered to discuss the state of phi delta theta chart its future growth determine policies and procedures and celebrate the bonds brotherhood in just a few weeks more than undergraduate alumni phis will gather for the th time in our history for similar while every phi delta theta general convention has its own characteristics and while no two conventions are the same there customs and traditions that have developed through the years create common experiences for phis in attendance this will be th general convention having been present at every one since when i attended my first convention in st louis as an phi i am pleased to tell you about some customs and traditions that hope you will experience when we gather in washington dc which you to the experiences of previous convention attendees these listed in no particular order or customs and traditions which link us to the convention many decades ago members who attended the general convention the practice of wearing small silver bars to designate the number conventions they had attended these bars when linked resemble ladders as phis attend more conventions the lengthen and provide striking evidence of a phis devotion to fraternity each bar indicates the city and year in which convention took place the phi who has attended the most conventions and has the longest ladder in fraternity history executive vice president emeritus robert j miller new mexico brother miller served as the chief executive for before retiring as executive vice president in in dc brother miller will secure his rd ladder since he has every convention since the centennial convention in while at the convention be sure to take a close look at ladder if asked i bet he may even share a story or two past william morrison great grandson of morrison and robert morrison westminster grandson of morrison visit with robert j miller new mexico who displaying the longest convention ladder in phi delta theta history the convention in opening business session roll think of this as a chapter meeting roll call but larger and impressive during the first business session on friday morning meeting will begin with the traditional roll call of chapters clubs and general officers of the fraternity the roll call conducted by executive vice president robert a biggs georgia and it is always impressive to hear how widespread the is across north america it is especially moving for many when biggs introduces a new phi delta theta chapter to the convention the introduction please welcome to their first biennial name of chapter or a reinstalled chapter with the please welcome back to the fold name of introductions are always special for those undergraduates and who worked especially hard during the biennium to be assist chartering a new chapter and are usually acknowledged enthusiastic executive vice president robert a biggs georgia southern conducts the roll call during the first business session of the convention in memorial one of the most solemn events which takes place during the convention is the conducting of the ritualistic ceremony the ceremony which is open to as well and by many family members and surviving spouses acknowledges those who have entered the chapter grand since the last convention and special notice to those alumni who have previously served the fraternity in a mark h ochsenbein eastern kentucky general president presents the wreath during the convention committee reports and convention since the general convention has held all supreme and powers of the fraternity the convention has three responsibilities and powers they electing the general consideration of judicial enacting laws for the regulation of the fraternity since only general convention may amend the ritual constitution and statutes of the there will be approximately voting delegates in attendance undergraduate chapter delegates holding about of the voting of the convention imagine a big chapter room with voting phi delta theta is a democratic fraternity and in order to conduct the business of the fraternity a number of committees appointed by the general council to consider issues being presented the convention these committees are composed of both undergraduate alumni voting delegates and discuss issues for the convention committee meetings prior to bringing them to the floor for and voting committees include code committee credentials committee procedure committee nominating appeals committee resolutions committee and wardens committee once committee has reviewed an item under its jurisdiction than it can brought to the convention floor where it will be discussed and necessary voted upon just like in a chapter an undergraduate member of the code committee presents legislation to the convention floor during the convention meet the one of the most important responsibilities of the general convention to elect the five men who will lead the fraternity for the next years as members of the general council the men elected to general council are charged to be the legal representative of fraternity and custodian of the property of the fraternity the council shall interpret and administer all laws of the fraternity make such policies and appointments as may be necessary to promote general welfare of the fraternity living within the regulations the constitution and general statutes of the fraternity the elected to the general council chart the course initiatives and direction of phi delta theta for the biennium beyond during the convention delegates have the chance to meet each of the candidates for the general council in the meet candidates forum in this format each candidate rotates through groups of voting delegates to discuss their ideas and thoughts for future of the fraternity and answer questions from delegates elections matter and the the allow delegates to have questions answered learn about the ideas priorities of the individual candidates who are running for and determine whom to vote for in this election decisions and actions of the general council affect many areas of fraternity and this is the time when delegates help determine future of phi delta general council reporter richard e fabritius kent state with a group of delegates during the general convention session to answer questions about the future of fraternity from convention delegates brother fabritius went on to during the general council model imagine being initiated in a large room in front of hundreds of serving as the chapter with the initiation being conducted by general council for a few men this is precisely will happen to them in washington dc during every convention model initiation is conducted and several new brothers are into the fraternity what an honor and privilege for these brothers to share their initiation experience with phis from north several men will sign the bond of phi delta theta and become during the convention much like lou gehrig columbia signed bond of the new york delta chapter on april the gehrig will be on display during the changing of the during every general convention there is a changing of the guard one general council to the next as the general council is charged overseeing the fraternity between conventions this biennial represents an important orderly transfer of leadership and the formal transition will take place during the business session on saturday afternoon once the council is sworn into office by the convention warden i will have honor as phi delta rd president of pinning the council pin on phi delta th president the leadership transition end with the pinning at this since i will be a past president of the general council ppgc other sitting on the front row will somehow it necessary to

trophy is a canadian inuit soapstone carving called the bird memorabilia from the fraternity the fraternity has quite an important collection of fraternity alumni memorabilia on display at general headquarters in oxford unfortunately hard for many to see these items unless they to ghq however during the convention the fraternity brings some the items and displays them for attendees in addition to historic delta theta badges and publications items of interest which are on display include the gehrig bond neil phi delta badge that he took to the moon and the academy award won by francis lyon ucla definitely want to have a camera with you you take a look at the on display during the convention will be the oscar won by francis and later presented by brother lyon to the general these

state university scott his wife and their children abby and alex live in salt lake filed under brotherhood phi delt general council general convention phi delta theta washington dc comment love your home chapter while serving an international posted on may by by rich fabritius general my phi delt experience has been filled by the presence of so tremendous volunteers many of them have never gotten a mention in scroll or during a convention but they work hard for our men and alumni brothers day after day been asked to write a fraternity volunteer enriched my experience and my life general my variety of great experiences with many a phi volunteer makes it difficult to comment on one my first contact with the general fraternity was through my president when i was an undergraduate brother george porosky with mercedes benz parked in the street across from the chapter house parking lights on he was a consistent positive presence in chapter patient and ever in control george steered us when we it and let us go when we needed to learn a lesson he hated chapter meetings he thought they were too long an engineer so think some of our ridiculousness was in firm contrast to constitution those meetings were long very long he was right course but they were fun and i remember thinking there was no place on the planet rather be than down in the chapter room sunday nights george is a main figure in my memory of but the volunteer who taught me perhaps my most treasured lesson phi delta theta is brother jim warner jim succeeded george province president of sigma south and prowls the sidelines of ohio for us to this day jim was an adviser at akron with ohio his alma mater just like george when i first met him i was undergraduate and remember meeting him at a kent state now there is a rivalry between akron and kent both and between our chapters so i was a tad perplexed by the presence an at a kent homecoming but when i met jim i quickly that he care about what chapter you were from he about you and he cared about phi delta theta i learned from jim lesson that has led me to this position today on the general i learned that phi delt just about your home chapter and a whole lot more than that i learned that phi delt is international brotherhood not a chapter i learned that you can your home chapter while serving an international brotherhood learned that phi delt is a whole lot bigger than kent university and make no mistake about it i love kent state and never be able to repay jim for the gift he gave me he planted me a curiosity about the larger organization i developed a thirst know our brotherhood beyond the buildings of kent ohio curiosity lead me to intern at the general headquarters which lead employment on the ghq staff while working for ghq i met my wife this day gift returns to me daily i imagine life without phi delta theta i imagine my experience without the deep gratifying experiences had the general fraternity and i imagine being a phi without as my brother mentor and thanks brother fabritius is the general council reporter his other service to phi delt has included education commissioner and president rich lives in atlanta with his wife heather and daughters austin and reese a past consultant and director of services for the general headquarters staff he is a graduate of state university and a member of the ohio lambda chapter rich is president managing director of brunner an advertising and agency his hobbies include travel golf and filed under alumni relations phi delt general phi delt volunteers tagged akron george jim warner kent state phi delta theta fabritius volunteerism leave a comment do i know when a chapter is living the ritual a mom tells posted on march by by scott as phi delta theta helps observe national ritual celebration week i asked to share some thoughts on what it means to live the ritual realize that from time to time i am asked by administrators parents alumni and undergraduate members to give definitive definition of how i know when a chapter is living ritual of phi delta theta and when i think about this question come to the conclusion that i know when a chapter is living the when a mom tells me so now going to come back to this as judge concept a little bit later but let me first share thoughts on being a fraternity man with a capital it would be easy and completely appropriate for me to define the as achieving the highest grades on campus providing tremendous amount of community service hours and raising a lot of for charity holding a lot of campus leadership positions and the ritual in all chapter meetings and functions and while each these specific acts are visible public and measurable and all good activities that i certainly encourage for me they this idea of the as i think about the three cardinal principles of friendship learning and rectitude laid out by our founders years ago in bond of phi delta theta and supported in the ritualistic that are the backbone of our fraternity they describe to me characteristics of my concept of a fraternity i want to return for a minute to the original view and perception fraternity men by the broader society i have always been struck by visual representation of a fraternity man which appeared over a ago this drawing coincided with a gathering of delts years ago in louisville kentucky at the general convention this illustration was printed in the and was the first editorial cartoon about fraternity convention ever published if you look closely at cartoon see that it characterizes the phi delt as somewhat larger broader and with more presence than the man he walking next to this cartoon represent him as a drunk slob or frat guy but as phi man as a man of character leader of men this phi delt have been featured on tfm frat the founders of phi delta theta were respected leaders of their and outlined for all of us a set of simple beliefs and which if followed lead to a life of honor respect and to me living the ritual becomes instinctive internalized and in the creation of lifelong habits and it begins at initiation president of phi delta theta i have had the opportunity of and installing many of our newest chapters and to each new chapter the installation banquet i offer the following when you were initiated and all signed the bond of phi delta you agreed to live your lives by three simple principles sound learning and moral rectitude i charge each of you here remember and honor those commitments to each other i charge the men phi delta theta to excel in the classroom to the best of your to sit in the front of class engage with your professors and to the academic to excel on the athletic field or performance venue always your best performance and exhibiting exemplary sportsmanship to engage on the campus get involved in student government other student organizations to lead not just to engage in the local community and serve those in to not abuse alcohol women or each last but not least to act in such a manner both and individually that all of your mothers fathers alumni friends will take pride in you as a fraternity if you do that you will have met the obligations you made when signed the so back to the mom as judge concept i know a chapter is the ritual when i hear from the parent of a phi which usually out to be the mother who calls or writes to tell me about her experience in the fraternity these messages sound like having never been involved in a fraternity before both my husband i were both very impressed and proud to see these young men filled enthusiasm and dedication the fraternity has been a experience for him and i know there will be a void once he this the brothers missouri eta missouri western were going to anyway but they went beyond a philanthropy project and made it personal for my family tanner who has a disability is almost are trying to accept that he will never be married he will never a car and may never attend college he will never have the to be a phi delta theta these men have embraced my family and me for that i am eternally grateful missouri eta chapter from the of my heart i love each and every one of you you are and caring and will always be a blessing in my i was admittedly apprehensive when he expressed an interest becoming involved with a fraternity our family had no experience fraternities or sororities and i had some of the typical regarding the greek system his father and i gave our approval with caveat that he must maintain a high grade point average and jeopardize his scholarship since he wishes to attend law school graduation i am proud to say that he is beginning his senior year has retained his scholarship for all four years in large part due the scholastic emphasis and support of the fraternity i have been impressed with the level of involvement of the alumni with undergraduates in phi delta theta they are truly committed fostering the development of these young men and certainly stress virtues that we all wish to instill in our sons honor loyalty responsibility personally i can attest to new levels of and maturity in my son that i believe are directly attributable to involvement in phi delta with time i have become less concerned with seeing it in terms formal activities and more interested in understanding that the of living the ritual is taking place within our chapters when i from a parent with a testimonial like these i know the chapter living the so in closing here are a few things i believe members of phi theta do every day to live the we care for one another and lift each other we challenge ourselves individually to be better men every we challenge each other to rise to a higher we call a brother out when he is going down the wrong we turn our backs on a brother in we celebrate each we believe in words like fraternity honor duty leadership brotherhood love and not we take pride in identifying ourselves as fraternity we believe in the lifetime commitments we made to each other we signed the my hope is that all of our brothers do these things that we strive to live the ritual to the best of our abilities because members of phi delta

the fraternity world we are very lucky to be phi delts one of the best if not the best reputation in the fraternity today other fraternities envy our organization for a variety reasons our educational programming is among the best out providing our undergrads and alumni volunteers with opportunities for growth and development our undergraduates are the best men walking the hills of college campuses across america our alumni are engaged and give tremendous amounts of talent and treasure to phi delt and most importantly we are willing to make hard decisions for the betterment of the in order to honor and perpetuate the objectives of the immortal other groups envy us because we make hard i personally find strength in the notion that i am a member of organization who is willing to do the right thing which leads me reputation management we owe each other and ourselves the effort be the best we can be to manage our reputations individually and an do you like what you see when you look in the mirror do you feel living up to the challenges of the argue that the best reputation management that can be done making sure you can look yourself in the eye being a phi means better than common and challenging ourselves and our brothers to better than the great thing about phi delt is the expectations are clear and to understand and we know when lived up to the challenge when fallen short falling short is ok falling short means recognize the need for improvement and perhaps some help from brothers in the process what there i was given a book call the edge when i went off to kent state

defense of posted on september by by scott mietchen president of the general as many readers of the phi delta theta blog have discovered this is national hazing prevention week and phi delta theta is doing all can to raise awareness about the issue in the past i have about my own experiences of being hazed hazing others and hazing in my own chapter over the years i have sat on both sides many discussions debating the pros and cons of hazing definitions hazing and hazing activities and the appropriateness and of having a culture of hazing within a chapter i hope that others take the time to share their thoughts on hazing in these that our undergraduate brothers give real thought to the expressed but i know that always the case i know that in many chapters across north america there are a certain number of brothers who simply roll their eyes and make some disparaging about yet another lecture on hazing i know that when leaders some chapters stand up in a meeting and propose the need to end that there can often be loud and vigorous to the concept change from some in the and sometimes i wonder why this continues to be an issue in the movement and why some members feel the need to continue hazing to so not going to here a lecture from me today about why is bad today i am writing to extend a sincere and honest to those who believe hazing makes phi delta theta a better the my challenge today directed at those undergraduate brothers either like hazing or have worked to end hazing in their my challenge today is to those brothers who rolled their eyes when thought this was going to be one more lecture chance for the general council president to yammer on about hazing more time my challenge is to those who fight vigorously effectively to keep hazing traditions in here is my challenge and offer to those the phi delta theta blog has become a very effective communication not only for phi delts but for the larger greek community blog are distributed over the facebook fan page to phis the blog posts are also read by other sorority and higher education leaders across north america many entries are and shared through email lists phi delta blog has become a key source for some of leading thought in and about the greek i am offering access to the phi delta theta blog to one member who can write a powerful thoughtful and well reasoned of hazing but there are some parameters and the rules and this is a real this offer is limited to current phi delta theta initiated members it is not open to alumni or the author must write an essay defending which the fraternity will run on the phi delta theta blog next writers can read other blog posts to determine an appropriate the essay does not need to deal with the legality or illegality the essay must discuss at a minimum the following why hazing should be allowed in phi delta why hazing helps create stronger why hazing helps us live up to the principles outlined in the why hazing is philosophically morally and ethically why hazing helps build better analyze and defend the ratio of hazing given that hazing activities have lead to harm injury or even death in cases to those seeking to join greek the essay cannot use the following the military does it they are professionally others do it the why i mom mom just defend why it is good for the betterment of phi in the essay you parse words or hazing activities this not a defense of whether or not doing interviews to meet the brothers or having house chores etc is hazing this needs to written as a defense of the benefits of hazing and the positive nature of things such as but not limited night time or any other big brother night with liquor pressure to consume wall sits calisthenics wearing funny clothes and pranks and eating gross or bad food sleep kangaroo courts or other mental late night runs swims servitude activities for older you get the picture in other words use your essay debate and argue for whether or not getting signatures is a good bad thing keep it intellectually honest and focused on the that everyone would understand as it must be understood that your essay if selected will published under your name anonymity be accepted we all need be willing to publically stand by our how it will be i will reach out to others in the fraternity for their input but will take responsibility for choosing the is a winner in short the answer is no if no essay is submitted that follows rules and parameters or follow the common rules of logic there will be no winning entry however if a essay is submitted then yes there will be a winner have to agree with what the brother writes it just needs to well written argued and neither you or your chapter will be disciplined for submitting an as general council president i offer my word that no brother submits an entry will be subject to discipline by the general or general headquarters i also offer my word that any entry will result in an investigation into activities in your chapter as a of an essay submission for those who know me you know that i by my word this is not a trick or trap this is a sincere only true believers in the benefits of hazing need the purpose of this challenge is not to encourage a brother to write essay defending a point of view they may not believe it this looking for someone to be a advocate this is a challenge those who believe that the effort to hazing is simply wrong and that hazing should be allowed to take in phi delta if you win hand you the fraternity a winning essay will have two significant opportunities to make the case about the benefits of the winning essay will run on the phi delta theta blog reaches well over people in october the writer of the winning essay will receive an trip to st louis in january as my guest at the leadership conference at plc i will yield my primetime spot to the brother to present his essay and make the case for phi delta theta should allow the winner however must also willing to engage in discussion debate with responders to the blog post and with their peers faculty at plc in a public debate so have access to the phi delta theta megaphone but need to be prepared to take part in a discussion about subject with your peers across north how to submit an essays can be submitted directly to me through my personal account my email account can be found on the phi delta theta under the contact us section the deadline for submissions october please include your name chapter and contact number in your submission so i can contact you with any questions winning essay will appear on the phi delta theta blog not long the why this in some ways this challenge harkens back to the early days of fraternity when a great deal of time was spent in chapter debating the significant issues of the day this was how the members of phi delta theta developed their minds analytical skills persuasive debating talents this is where phis learned to take position defend an idea and become a phi delta theta has taken an active stance against hazing for decades and yet it continues in far too many places i can only conclude it continues because there remain active believers in its practice well as defenders of its continuing use there must be phis who believe phi delta efforts to end hazing are wrong if delta theta is wrong in working to eradicate hazing than it would much better to bring the debate out in the public light and let it the scrutiny of active supreme court justice william o douglas once wrote the way to noxious ideas is with other ideas the way to combat falsehoods with this is an opportunity for defenders of hazing to make their case the phi delt nation that phi delta theta should reconsider our on the i encourage phis who have brothers in their chapters who defend protect hazing practices to share this challenge with those and encourage them to submit an essay it be acceptable defend hazing behind closed doors but not be willing to make a defense for its use in our phikeia education i think it is clear where i and the entire general council stand and have stood for many years personally i believe our effort to end hazing is the right decision for phi delta however i also understand that not all brothers may not agree this position it is those brothers i challenge today with genuine offer of challenging the current position microphone is brother

prevention week phi delta theta scott mietchen comments invitation to nfl commissioner roger goodell please join us in to stop posted on august by by scott mietchen general council hazing as the international president of phi delta theta i that anytime i say or write this word many of our members undergraduate and alumni roll their eyes and expect to hear another lecture on the litany of reasons why hazing has no place in greek movement in general or in our fraternity specifically this piece directed at the members of phi delta theta it is directed at one of the most powerful thoughtful and men in the world of sports roger goodell the commissioner of national football you see while the words fraternity and hazing are often together the problem of hazing exists in many areas of our including professional college and high school athletics i refuse accept the common perception that hazing is just a problem in fact i believe that fraternities and sororities and their respective chapters do more try and combat hazing then any organizations i can think of i that the greek system gets most of the focus and i realize we have to completely end these practices within our own organizations though we have been waging the fight against hazing for however we greeks cannot combat hazing alone without key joining with us to end these stupid pointless harmful and dangerous traditions in fact it makes it more difficult for us combat hazing in our own ranks when the media celebrates acts hazing in shows such as the hbo series hard knocks where humorously profiled hazing in the nfl this past that is why i was so pleased to read this past week that jack del head coach of the jacksonville jaguars has banned hazing this from the jaguars rookie training camp after things got out of hand coach del rio defended his decision by saying that needed to have more respect for each other in order to be teammates and with his simple order hazing stopped in the training camp and just this week jason garrett head coach of dallas cowboys followed suit with a similar ban for his for a coach to take this step in the nfl is important because it trickle down to other nfl teams and then into collegiate and school athletics ask any high school athlete coach or referee hazing and you will hear some incredible stories you can google high school sports hazing and read an astonishing number deplorable stories the nfl serves as a role model to high school collegiate athletes whether it accepts the role or not and hazing is accepted and even celebrated in the nfl it makes it acceptable at the high school and collegiate levels by students that hazing is an acceptable i am asking nfl commissioner roger goodell for help last i wrote commissioner goodell a letter asking for his leadership addressing hazing in the nfl and offering as help phi delta years of experience in fighting the issue that request for help the commissioner and offer of assistance by our fraternity today the nfl sets the tone for many norms in our society and players coaches and owners do indeed serve as role models for youth their leadership on any issue can make a difference leadership to join the fight against hazing just might even save at the time i wrote commissioner goodell last fall there were other things on his plate including the recently completed talks between the players and owners those talks are now the players are back in training camp and the nfl will most likely another record breaking season unfortunately the commissioner an opportunity to ban hazing with the recently completed bargaining while i realize that there is much the office throughout the year on a wide variety of issues i would hope that may see the steps recently taken by the jaguars and cowboys as opportunity to use his position of leadership to begin stamping hazing in the nfl his actions now may help lead to the elimination hazing in other levels of sports which can also help us in our against hazing commissioner goodell has the unilateral ability draw the line in the sand regarding behavioral standards in the nfl authority he has used in the past to deal with other issues which viewed as a threat to the league its players i believe commissioner has the decency to take a stand that can affect of young men and women who may never play in his league and beyond illegality of hazing in many states just stupid wrong not suggesting that we blame hazing within our organization on nfl far from it phi delta theta will continue its to stamp out hazing in our own organization regardless of what do however i am suggesting that the active and vocal leadership commissioner goodell on this issue could impact many parts of for decades to commissioner goodell you have the ability to unilaterally stop in the nfl all it takes from you is the stroke of a pen consider joining us in this effort as it will have very consequences far beyond the gates of the national football

wrong posted on april by by scott mietchen general council i am writing as the international president of phi delta fraternity to express my surprise that such a international publication as the wall street journal would allow a weakly argued article as shutter fraternities for young good to appear on its news pages while the piece could certainly been written as an oped piece expressing the personal point of view it appeared in a section reserved news items in my view the writer exhibited journalistic and logic standards and did a tremendous disservice to millions of current undergraduate alumni members who have exemplary fraternity experiences please let me first let me state that what happened to ms seccuro as undergraduate at the university of virginia years ago is horrible and beyond explanation or excuse and i hope the was appropriately punished but however horrible this event was i agree it was horrible it was not caused because a fraternity at the university of virginia for the same reason that it did happen because the university of virginia is coeducational happened because the young men involved did not know the boundaries they legal moral or ethical between right and the author ms flanagan writes the greek system is dedicated quelling young anxiety about submitting themselves to four of book learning by providing them with a variety of activities drinking drugging espn watching and the mistreatment of women i could not disagree with ms flanagan about her broad and untrue characterization of fraternity men this simply not a description of fraternity life that i recognize as i believe her article commits one of the classic logical fallacies confusing association with as the president of phi delta theta fraternity with nearly undergraduate members and alumni members located in chapters over north american campuses i can state unequivocally that characterization of what we are dedicated to is just wrong and based on a stereotypical view often times reinforced in media through movies such as animal house time to put house to rest a movie nothing more not reality i also state unequivocally that i have never heard of any other or international fraternity dedicated to the activities described in the the vast majority of fraternity men i know do not fit the description at all the men i know serve as campus leaders academic success in the classroom take part in academic graduate at higher levels than men move on to or professional schools at higher levels excel on the athletic or artistic venue and serve their communities this may play a role in explaining why fraternity men generally have a great deal pride and affection for their fraternity as well as i sadly have to agree with ms assessment that abuse alcohol is a significant problem on college campuses today and i have to agree that surveys reveal that this problem can fraternity populations at a higher level than the general body i also agree that abuse of alcohol plays a significant role both men and women in many of the challenges facing today whether it be sexual harassment or abuse academic issues or harmful interpersonal the entire greek movement fraternities and sororities working our partners in higher education has been working to educate members and stem the abuse of alcohol for many years each of the than fraternities has developed own approaches for addressing this serious issue i applaud all these proactive efforts for phi delta theta in addition to education programs we have taken the approach of creating housing and removing alcohol from our chapter houses for the decade for our organization this has worked for fraternities other approaches have i wish that all fraternity chapters across north america offered exemplary experience but that would be dishonest unfortunately chapters have lost their way and digressed from the values around they were created it is then up to each fraternity to hold chapters accountable to the values and beliefs of their organizations i believe most fraternities work to hold individual chapters accountable i know that phi delta theta committed to upholding our founding principles of friendship learning and fraternities have existed and thrived on north american campuses nearly two centuries we have our issues that we continue to and we have never claimed to be perfect however as a former university administrator i would argue that fraternities sororities continue to provide an invaluable learning experience complements the classroom experience and that we continue to the best real life leadership learning laboratory on a as the father of two children one a daughter who is in her junior of high school and just beginning the college search process and other a junior high school son i have to admit that i am proud to that i not only believe in the continuing relevance and importance fraternity and sorority system but that i enthusiastically encourage both my son and daughter to consider if is right for them for phi delta theta we have had a chapter at university of virginia since and have a great deal of pride in accomplishments and characteristics of the men that comprise chapter at i think it is unfortunate that the author would take such a personal experience and use it to demonize and categorize the more undergraduate men as well as millions of alumni who belong college fraternal organizations in north america we all corporate employees for the unethical actions of a few we fire all of the faculty of a university because one plagiarizes thesis we cancel all professional sports because some broke the rules and took drugs we down all organizations because one operated in an manner it just how we do this is the story of a despicable rape and its aftermath not a about fraternities a sound argument is a valid argument with premises this article provided neither please use poor and lack of facts to paint all of us

september by by scott mietchen general council this week serves as national hazing prevention week and as council president i was asked to write about why hazing has no in phi delta theta while it would be easy for me to simply repeat greek mantra outlining the evils of hazing in order discredit hazing practices i wanted to use this opportunity to tell own story with hazing and why i feel so strongly about the need bring an end to these practices you see as a phikeia i was as a new initiate i was an active and enthusiastic hazer as a officer i stopped hazing in our chapter this is a bit of my being i pledged phi delta theta at the university of utah in the fall this was just a few years after the release of animal house i was the poster child for the target market for greek life at the i was the consummate joiner i was bound and determined to involved on campus and even though i come from a background i saw fraternity life as the way to immediately involved on this large public university campus going through rush was split between three fraternities at the end of a very formal week period and ultimately decided to pledge phi delta theta because liked the laid back real and friendly nature of the guys i met guys made me feel welcome and soon after our official pledge ceremony we held our first meeting and were given the requirements to complete in order to initiated our requirements included the usual items read and the phikeia manual meet and learn something about all of the organize a community service event organize a social with a pledge class etc the chapter officers also told us that the pledge as identified by the chapter brothers would be recognized initiation with the low bond number of the pledge class competitive i was determined to earn that low bond now i expected some fun and games throughout my pledge because i had seen them in the movies and i figured they were simply rite of passage that i could tolerate and survive my ultimate however was to earn the low bond number and i worked diligently to that top pledge i played the role to the best of my abilities completed my assignments early i mastered facts about the i met with all of the active brothers i maintained a attitude and i adopted the attitude of grin and bear it through hazing hazing in my chapter extremely physical it primarily mental with some minor physical activities included i paddled forced to do calisthenics or consume massive amounts alcohol or dropped off in the dessert somewhere blindfolded and to walk back for me it was more subtle line ups late night sessions servitude yelling demeaning remarks surprise kangaroo courts etc and i excelled at all of it i could recite greek alphabet backwards and forwards before the match burned finger i could stand with a spotlight in my face at am while being yelled and cursed at by the wimpiest guy in chapter who also happened to be fairly inebriated i could say sir faster than almost anyone and mean it i could memorize poems used to address the brothers as well as to answer the phone knew that i could put up with anything because i wanted to be and i wanted that low bond when it came time for initiation or i put up with a lot wore the dumb clothes ate the horrible food carried items campus gave up sleep lived in squalor and continued to endure games mental hazing included those exercises where we were lead believe we be initiated or that our entire pledge class was failure after five days of sleep deprivation spotlights poor food mind games physical stress and threats i have to admit began to wonder if it was all worth it then just as quickly as started it was over and i was initiated however i am sad to say remember much of my own initiation i was simply too tired mentally frayed to pay attention when initiation starts at and ends at am and occurs after five days of hell there little to remember or cherish i was simply in survival mode but the end i had survived and achieved my goal i had been named best pledge and was rewarded with the low bond number in my class it felt great the pledge program had made me a great unfortunately i had also developed some real enmity toward several the brothers and younger alumni who were the most aggressive hazers the chapter i put on a smile in their presence but i developed respect for them and to this day i have no desire to with them at alumni events i always thought it odd that i had a collection of miscellaneous facts and figures about the fraternity but i had not learned very much about what makes for a strong however i rationalized that perhaps learning about running the too important and once i was initiated i wait have my turn to haze the next pledge class now it was my and now it was my turn to be a not long after being initiated we took our spring pledge class part of my own pledge program i had read the prohibiting hazing it was printed right in the phikeia manual but had bought into the tradition and rite of passage rationales think anything bad would happen it was during the first class after mine that i became a great hazer i could demand play mental games and demean the pledges with the best of them the worst hazer but i held my own not proud of the that i could get in a face at am and yell at because he know how many bricks there were in old north dorm believed that if they really wanted to be phis they needed to earn and that this was just part of the path to membership after all had come through just fine and it was by now i was also on the executive committee and had to learn more about the policies i met first chapter consultant from general headquarters and engaged in heated debate with him about what was and was not hazing i to focus on the specific aspects that made an activity a activity because it made for an endless debate however i could quite bring myself to truthfully evaluate whether it was morally ethically right or wrong quite frankly at the time i thought policies were just set by a bunch of general officers who really know what was happening at the at the same time my pledge class had taken on several key positions and decided to try and really upgrade our chapter and some fraternity awards however to do this we knew we needed to something about our pledge program or perhaps we could just about some of our most cherished traditions in our awards why i stopped the the next fall my sophomore year we took a fairly large pledge and our pledge program contained the same hazing traditions and of passage from previous years and i participated as however this time something happened that changed my our phikeia class had completed their pledge program and was for initiation week it was at this point that one of our keith started to become quiet he had always been somewhat but now it was becoming more pronounced our initiation lasted five days with formal initiation on the last evening the first four days of keith became progressively withdrawn more reserved and more quiet quite frankly several of sleep deprivation stress and mental hazing had dimmed the spark his eyes and we started to get having finished the fun of we were preparing the pledge for their formal initiation except that we had a problem when we to get keith for the initiation ceremony we found him in his curled up in the corner of the pledge room rocking back and forth humming he was he had simply gone beyond his for emotional stress and lack of sleep and was now nearly we were able to get keith to his feet and literally helped him each step of the entire initiation ceremony with one brother on arm whispering in his ears the words he was to repeat we were for keith and scared for ourselves toward the end of the when keith realized that he had been initiated his mental started to improve since the emotional stress of the past five days begun to dissipate however as active members we were concerned for safety and for his reaction and to truthful we were terrified that the chapter would get into we persuaded keith to stay at the chapter house for an additional days after initiation so he could sleep and return to a normal state mind which he did however it was then and there that i saw dangers and banality of hazing on that day i and several of pledge brothers made the commitment to end hazing in our chapter had come with the fact that hazing funny entertaining and it can be very stopping hazing i discovered a very simple truth in our fight to end hazing most the brothers in the chapter really like hazing they just along with it because it was tradition except for a small number hardcore hazers and they were hardcore there was very little against stopping the hazing as officers we simply said no hazing and for the most part hazing ended it discussions at ten chapter meetings or a chapter task force anything else it simply took leaders standing up and saying no hazing hazing is defined as any action taken or situation intentionally or unintentionally whether with or without the of the persons subjected to that action which produces mental physical discomfort embarrassment harassment or generally individuals within chapters with hazing cultures of age or status have the same common reply when asked about practices heard the excuses for years and i can tell you experience that they are simply no one will get funny the they like it they said it was okay if they it helps build team cohesiveness and i went through it a rite of one person can stop some may read this and think there they go again one of those national guys preaching to us again about hazing and you know i would understand that mentality because i felt the same way at time but i would ask you to consider for just a minute the morals safety and potential disasters that might occur should program of hazing go wrong i would ask you to consider if you be so resolute in your opinions if you or your chapter damaged or even lost a brother i would ask you to consider would all be worth it for the sake of tradition i would hope you be so nonchalant in ignoring all of the advice and help available you to end hazing in your if your chapter has a hazing problem i ask you as a brother consider taking just one step please consider being that phi who stands up says no more and stops the hazing your chapter become a better place because of your the an amazing thing happened once we stopped the hazing and improved phikeia education program our chapter got remarkably better we in numbers academics quality chapter operations and several years after these changes took hold my chapter went on to some of the most prestigious awards some of my most loyal and active alumni today come from the pledge classes were spared the indignities of hazing and to this day keith one of my best friends he and his wife have raised a great family he remains a loyal and active phi and as i write this i realize beyond that initiation week nearly years ago he and i have talked about this probably something we would all just please remember and consider hazing proud to be a brother mietchen is the general council

by moe stephens general council in case you heard the united states just finished a significant process election time for me always comes with emotions of excitement for potential change or fear of the same as university administrator all of the election coverage also got me think about the election process for fraternities and sororities north america many of you are electing new executive boards and be feeling many of the same emotions i described if you are running for or have recently been elected president your chapter the task before you is likely intimidating exciting full of the i must preface the following with the realization that i am by no an expert in fraternity and sorority life i am well versed and many experiences in this area but it is such a dynamic that i believe you are the experts because you are living that being said i often meet with new presidents and i provide following communicate authentically there are so many different groups a chapter president must communicate with it can be hard remember whom you have brought into the loop if you are what i call authentic communication it matter everyone are bringing to the table will have the same information it require you to be honest with both yourself and your authentic communication is not always the easiest course of action i guarantee you it will only help when the fecal matter hits oscillating device the more trust you have developed with your constituent groups the easier it will be to work through the before you are now living in the fishbowl the phi delta theta chapter the university of washington has a large glassed in dining area call the fishbowl the sidewalk and street right outside are travelled with students and community members passing by the eats there holds social events there and often has special in the fishbowl i have always thought it was great that the could see into the daily life of a phi delt at uw however i also thought about how difficult that might be at times the chapter does in that room is visible and anyone passing by draw their own conclusions about what is happening as a president you are now living in that fishbowl your actions and are being seen and heard often by people you are not even aware watching and listening you are setting an example for your and broadcasting a message to the rest of your community make sure is the right example be certain it is the right make good choices i often end meetings with the phrase make choices outside of the context of sorority and fraternity life simple phrase is much more difficult and open to interpretation as member of a fraternity or sorority it is actually very simple and live the ritual of your organization within your ritual values that are relevant and have withstood the changing times as ed king stated in his classic piece the secret thoughts of because i am a system of values i am therefore an instrument of evaluation my values are clear and absolute and yet difficult emulate to state a few i am honor courage integrity courtesy and i demand self control as well as ambition and what your founders did is take the idea of friendship and move it significant step forward to the concept of commitment as fraternity and sorority advisor i do not think you are going to perfect however i do expect that you and your chapter members about the values of your organization and use them to guide decisions imagine how much easier it would be to make decisions as executive board if you consistently asked the simple question does this align with friendship sound learning or own it you must be willing to accept responsibility for the of your chapter both past and present noted entrepreneur and jim rohn once said you must take personal responsibility you change the circumstances the seasons or the wind but you can yourself once you decide it is time to own it you can begin process of creating positive enjoy the ride being a chapter president is arguably the difficult leadership position on a college campus you are a model a counselor a mentor an administrator an advisor and spokesperson expectations for chapter presidents are high and should be however many chapter presidents get so caught up in all things to all people that they forget to simply be a sister or brother along with the rest of the responsibilities you have as chapter president it is important for you to remember to have take care of yourself and enjoy the my preference for this blog entry would be for this to be conversation and not just me giving advice of course this is not extensive list of advice for new presidents i am not sure one even be compiled i am interested in hearing from all of you because your voice is the one that truly moe has many years of progressive leadership and success in affairs he has traveled the country working for phi delta theta both a leadership consultant and as the director of expansion moe his wife allison and their

biennial convention will be the fourth time that we have met in the capital city for such meeting the other times being in and in this summer we are continuing a tradition of meeting on a interval as a fraternity since our founding years the first the first convention was held just three short years after the of phi delta theta when seven phis met on december at woodruff house in cincinnati at the time there were only chapters in the fraternity while that first convention was different in size and scope from the one we will soon experience purpose was the same to discuss the state of our brotherhood and its from walter b authoritative account the history of delta theta we know that the first convention was conceived in when founder john mcmillan wilson miami wrote to robert morrison miami what can be done as to holding a at say cincinnati next christmas holidays or what do you advise the matter the suggestion was carried out when in november wilson wrote to morrison who was in tennessee at the time convention will be held between christmas and day cincinnati the minutes of ohio alpha for december report order to transact some business of a general nature a motion by unanimous voice to call a convention to be represented by graduate and undergraduate members of the several colleges of order to meet on tuesday morning dec messrs ross and harrison were appointed to report to the convention feasibility of establishing other chapters of fdth the meeting on december st first organized itself by electing is miami president and benjamin harrison miami following the convention benjamin harrison john mcmillan wilson lw ross were appointed to communicate the proceedings of convention to the existing in at the first convention seven undergraduate and alumni gathered to discuss the state of phi delta theta chart its future growth determine policies and procedures and celebrate the bonds brotherhood in just a few weeks more than undergraduate alumni phis will gather for the th time in our history for similar while every phi delta theta general convention has its own characteristics and while no two conventions are the same there customs and traditions that have developed through the years create common experiences for phis in attendance this will be th general convention having been present at every one since when i attended my first convention in st louis as an phi i am pleased to tell you about some customs and traditions that hope you will experience when we gather in washington dc which you to the experiences of previous convention attendees these listed in no particular order or customs and traditions which link us to the convention many decades ago members who attended the general convention the practice of wearing small silver bars to designate the number conventions they had attended these bars when linked resemble ladders as phis attend more conventions the lengthen and provide striking evidence of a phis devotion to fraternity each bar indicates the city and year in which convention took place the phi who has attended the most conventions and has the longest ladder in fraternity history executive vice president emeritus robert j miller new mexico brother miller served as the chief executive for before retiring as executive vice president in in dc brother miller will secure his rd ladder since he has every convention since the centennial convention in while at the convention be sure to take a close look at ladder if asked i bet he may even share a story or two past william morrison great grandson of morrison and robert morrison westminster grandson of morrison visit with robert j miller new mexico who displaying the longest convention ladder in phi delta theta history the convention in opening business session roll think of this as a chapter meeting roll call but larger and impressive during the first business session on friday morning meeting will begin with the traditional roll call of chapters clubs and general officers of the fraternity the roll call conducted by executive vice president robert a biggs georgia and it is always impressive to hear how widespread the is across north america it is especially moving for many when biggs introduces a new phi delta theta chapter to the convention the introduction please welcome to their first biennial name of chapter or a reinstalled chapter with the please welcome back to the fold name of introductions are always special for those undergraduates and who worked especially hard during the biennium to be assist chartering a new chapter and are usually acknowledged enthusiastic executive vice president robert a biggs georgia southern conducts the roll call during the first business session of the convention in memorial one of the most solemn events which takes place during the convention is the conducting of the ritualistic ceremony the ceremony which is open to as well and by many family members and surviving spouses acknowledges those who have entered the chapter grand since the last convention and special notice to those alumni who have previously served the fraternity in a mark h ochsenbein eastern kentucky general president presents the wreath during the convention committee reports and convention since the general convention has held all supreme and powers of the fraternity the convention has three responsibilities and powers they electing the general consideration of judicial enacting laws for the regulation of the fraternity since only general convention may amend the ritual constitution and statutes of the there will be approximately voting delegates in attendance undergraduate chapter delegates holding about of the voting of the convention imagine a big chapter room with voting phi delta theta is a democratic fraternity and in order to conduct the business of the fraternity a number of committees appointed by the general council to consider issues being presented the convention these committees are composed of both undergraduate alumni voting delegates and discuss issues for the convention committee meetings prior to bringing them to the floor for and voting committees include code committee credentials committee procedure committee nominating appeals committee resolutions committee and wardens committee once committee has reviewed an item under its jurisdiction than it can brought to the convention floor where it will be discussed and necessary voted upon just like in a chapter an undergraduate member of the code committee presents legislation to the convention floor during the convention meet the one of the most important responsibilities of the general convention to elect the five men who will lead the fraternity for the next years as members of the general council the men elected to general council are charged to be the legal representative of fraternity and custodian of the property of the fraternity the council shall interpret and administer all laws of the fraternity make such policies and appointments as may be necessary to promote general welfare of the fraternity living within the regulations the constitution and general statutes of the fraternity the elected to the general council chart the course initiatives and direction of phi delta theta for the biennium beyond during the convention delegates have the chance to meet each of the candidates for the general council in the meet candidates forum in this format each candidate rotates through groups of voting delegates to discuss their ideas and thoughts for future of the fraternity and answer questions from delegates elections matter and the the allow delegates to have questions answered learn about the ideas priorities of the individual candidates who are running for and determine whom to vote for in this election decisions and actions of the general council affect many areas of fraternity and this is the time when delegates help determine future of phi delta general council reporter richard e fabritius kent state with a group of delegates during the general convention session to answer questions about the future of fraternity from convention delegates brother fabritius went on to during the general council model imagine being initiated in a large room in front of hundreds of serving as the chapter with the initiation being conducted by general council for a few men this is precisely will happen to them in washington dc during every convention model initiation is conducted and several new brothers are into the fraternity what an honor and privilege for these brothers to share their initiation experience with phis from north several men will sign the bond of phi delta theta and become during the convention much like lou gehrig columbia signed bond of the new york delta chapter on april the gehrig will be on display during the changing of the during every general convention there is a changing of the guard one general council to the next as the general council is charged overseeing the fraternity between conventions this biennial represents an important orderly transfer of leadership and the formal transition will

home chapter while serving an international posted on may by by rich fabritius general my phi delt experience has been filled by the presence of so tremendous volunteers many of them have never gotten a mention in scroll or during a convention but they work hard for our men and alumni brothers day after day been asked to write a fraternity volunteer enriched my experience and my life general my variety of great experiences with many a phi volunteer makes it difficult to comment on one my first contact with the general fraternity was through my president when i was an undergraduate brother george porosky with mercedes benz parked in the street across from the chapter house parking lights on he was a consistent positive presence in chapter patient and ever in control george steered us when we it and let us go when we needed to learn a lesson he hated chapter meetings he thought they were too long an engineer so think some of our ridiculousness was in firm contrast to constitution those meetings were long very long he was right course but they were fun and i remember thinking there was no place on the planet rather be than down in the chapter room sunday nights george is a main figure in my memory of but the volunteer who taught me perhaps my most treasured lesson phi delta theta is brother jim warner jim succeeded george province president of sigma south and prowls the sidelines of ohio for us to this day jim was an adviser at akron with ohio his alma mater just like george when i first met him i was undergraduate and remember meeting him at a kent state now there is a rivalry between akron and kent both and between our chapters so i was a tad perplexed by the presence an at a kent homecoming but when i met jim i quickly that he care about what chapter you were from he about you and he cared about phi delta theta i learned from jim lesson that has led me to this position today on the general i learned that phi delt just about your home chapter and a whole lot more than that i learned that phi delt is international brotherhood not a chapter i learned that you can your home chapter while serving an international brotherhood learned that phi delt is a whole lot bigger than kent university and make no mistake about it i love kent state and never be able to repay jim for the gift he gave me he planted me a curiosity about the larger organization i developed a thirst know our brotherhood beyond the buildings of kent ohio curiosity lead me to intern at the general headquarters which lead employment on the ghq staff while working for ghq i met my wife this day gift returns to me daily i imagine life without phi delta theta i imagine my experience without the deep gratifying experiences had the general fraternity and i imagine being a phi without as my brother mentor and thanks brother fabritius is the general council reporter his other service to phi delt has included education commissioner and president rich lives in atlanta with his

warner kent state phi delta theta fabritius volunteerism leave a comment do i know when a chapter is living the ritual a mom tells posted on march by by scott as phi delta theta helps observe national ritual celebration week i asked to share some thoughts on what it means to live the ritual realize that from time to time i am asked by administrators parents alumni and undergraduate members to give definitive definition of how i know when a chapter is living ritual of phi delta theta and when i think about this question come to the conclusion that i know when a chapter is living the when a mom tells me so now going to come back to this as judge concept a little bit later but let me first share thoughts on being a fraternity man with a capital it would be easy and completely appropriate for me to define the as achieving the highest grades on campus providing tremendous amount of community service hours and raising a lot of for charity holding a lot of campus leadership positions and the ritual in all chapter meetings and functions and while each these specific acts are visible public and measurable and all good activities that i certainly encourage for me they this idea of the as i think about the three cardinal principles of friendship learning and rectitude laid out by our founders years ago in bond of phi delta theta and supported in the ritualistic that are the backbone of our fraternity they describe to me characteristics of my concept of a fraternity i want to return for a minute to the original view and perception fraternity men by the broader society i have always been struck by visual representation of a fraternity man which appeared over a ago this drawing coincided with a gathering of delts years ago in louisville kentucky at the general convention this illustration was printed in the and was the first editorial cartoon about fraternity convention ever published if you look closely at cartoon see that it characterizes the phi delt as somewhat larger broader and with more presence than the man he walking next to this cartoon represent him as a drunk slob or frat guy but as phi man as a man of character leader of men this phi delt have been featured on tfm frat the founders of phi delta theta were respected leaders of their and outlined for all of us a set of simple beliefs and which if followed lead to a life of honor respect and to me living the ritual becomes instinctive internalized and in the creation of lifelong habits and it begins at initiation president of phi delta theta i have had the opportunity of and installing many of our newest chapters and to each new chapter the installation banquet i offer the following when you were initiated and all signed the bond of phi delta you agreed to live your lives by three simple principles sound learning and moral rectitude i charge each of you here remember and honor those commitments to each other i charge the men phi delta theta to excel in the classroom to the best of your to sit in the front of class engage with your professors and to the academic to excel on the athletic field or performance venue always your best performance and exhibiting exemplary sportsmanship to engage on the campus get involved in student government other student organizations to lead not just to engage in the local community and serve those in to not abuse alcohol women or each last but not least to act in such a manner both and individually that all of your mothers fathers alumni friends will take pride in you as a fraternity if you do that you will have met the obligations you made when signed the so back to the mom as judge concept i know a chapter is the ritual when i hear from the parent of a phi which usually out to be the mother who calls or writes to tell me about her experience in the fraternity these messages sound like having never been involved in a fraternity before both my husband i were both very impressed and proud to see these young men filled enthusiasm and dedication the fraternity has been a experience for him and i know there will be a void once he this the brothers missouri eta missouri western were going to anyway but they went beyond a philanthropy project and made it personal for my family tanner who has a disability is almost are trying to accept that he will never be married he will never a car and may never attend college he will never have the to be a phi delta theta these men have embraced my family and me for that i am eternally grateful missouri eta chapter from the of my heart i love each and every one of you you are and caring and will always be a blessing in my i was admittedly apprehensive when he expressed an interest becoming involved with a fraternity our family had no experience fraternities or sororities and i had some of the typical regarding the greek system his father and i gave our approval with caveat that he must maintain a high grade point average and jeopardize his scholarship since he wishes to attend law school graduation i am proud to say that he is beginning his senior year has retained his scholarship for all four years in large part due the scholastic emphasis and support of the fraternity i have been impressed with the level of involvement of the alumni with undergraduates in phi delta theta they are truly committed fostering the development of these young men and certainly stress virtues that we all wish to instill in our sons honor loyalty responsibility personally i can attest to new levels of and maturity in my son that i believe are directly attributable to involvement in phi delta with time i have become less concerned with seeing it in terms formal activities and more interested in understanding that the of living the ritual is taking place within our chapters when i from a parent with a testimonial like these i know the chapter living the so in closing here are a few things i believe members of phi theta do every day to live the we care for one another and lift each other we challenge ourselves individually to be better men every we challenge each other to rise to a higher we call a brother out when he is going down the wrong we turn our backs on a brother in we celebrate each we believe in words like fraternity honor duty leadership brotherhood love and not we take pride in identifying ourselves as fraternity we believe in the lifetime commitments we made to each other we signed the my hope is that all of our brothers do these things that we strive to live the ritual to the best of our abilities because members of phi delta theta because what phi delts brother mietchen is the general council president scott is a graduate of the university of utah where he earned both his bs mpa he has served the fraternity as a chapter

tagged fraternity delta theta ritual scott mietchen comments your posted on february by by rich when i was asked to blog about pr for this post my thoughts went to exploring an experience from my professional life an advertising guy i work alongside our pr professionals all the as well as practitioners from other agencies fun to work them in building a business building their while there are certainly lessons and observations i can draw upon inform this post in the end i find them a little weightless in context of being a instead i got to thinking about reputations within our fraternity the fraternity world we are very lucky to be phi delts one of the best if not the best reputation in the fraternity today other fraternities envy our organization for a variety reasons our educational programming is among the best out providing our undergrads and alumni volunteers with opportunities for growth and development our undergraduates are the best men walking the hills of college campuses across america our alumni are engaged and give tremendous amounts of talent and treasure to phi delt and most importantly we are willing to make hard decisions for the betterment of the in order to honor and perpetuate the objectives of the immortal other groups envy us because we make hard i personally find strength in the notion that i am a member of organization who is willing to do the right thing which leads me reputation management we owe each other and ourselves the effort be the best we can be to manage our reputations individually and an do you like what you see when you look in the mirror do you feel living up to the challenges of the argue that the best reputation management that can be done making sure you can look yourself in the eye being a phi means better than common and challenging ourselves and our brothers to better than the great thing about phi delt is the expectations are clear and to understand and we know when lived up to the challenge when fallen short falling short is ok falling short means recognize the need for improvement and perhaps some help from brothers in the process what there i was given a book call the edge when i went off to kent state it a compilation of inspirational quotes and stories the was a cleveland area high school wrestling coach with the of my badge it was my most prized possession in college many an rolled when i quoted the edge at a chapter meeting during my chapter meeting before graduating i bequeathed the edge to one of favorite brothers i miss that book but i learned years later collin boetger still has it in

defense of posted on september by by scott mietchen president of the general as many readers of the phi delta theta blog have discovered this is national hazing prevention week and phi delta theta is doing all can to raise awareness about the issue in the past i have about my own experiences of being hazed hazing others and hazing in my own chapter over the years i have sat on both sides many discussions debating the pros and cons of hazing definitions hazing and hazing activities and the appropriateness and of having a culture of hazing within a chapter i hope that others take the time to share their thoughts on hazing in these that our undergraduate brothers give real thought to the expressed but i know that always the case i know that in many chapters across north america there are a certain number of brothers who simply roll their eyes and make some disparaging about yet another lecture on hazing i know that when leaders some chapters stand up in a meeting and propose the need to end that there can often be loud and vigorous to the concept change from some in the and sometimes i wonder why this continues to be an issue in the movement and why some members feel the need to continue hazing to so not going to here a lecture from me today about why is bad today i am writing to extend a sincere and honest to those who believe hazing makes phi delta theta a better the my challenge today directed at those undergraduate brothers either like hazing or have worked to end hazing in their my challenge today is to those brothers who rolled their eyes when thought this was going to be one more lecture chance for the general council president to yammer on about hazing more time my challenge is to those who fight vigorously effectively to keep hazing traditions in here is my challenge and offer to those the phi delta theta blog has become a very effective communication not only for phi delts but for the larger greek community blog are distributed over the facebook fan page to phis the blog posts are also read by other sorority and higher education leaders across north america many entries are and shared through email lists phi delta blog has become a key source for some of leading thought in and about the greek i am offering access to the phi delta theta blog to one member who can write a powerful thoughtful and well reasoned of hazing but there are some parameters and the rules and this is a real this offer is limited to current phi delta theta initiated members it is not open to alumni or the author must write an essay defending which the fraternity will run on the phi delta theta blog next writers can read other blog posts to determine an appropriate the essay does not need to deal with the legality or illegality the essay must discuss at a minimum the following why hazing should be allowed in phi delta why hazing helps create stronger why hazing helps us live up to the principles outlined in the why hazing is philosophically morally and ethically why hazing helps build better analyze and defend the ratio of hazing given that hazing activities have lead to harm injury or even death in cases to those seeking to join greek the essay cannot use the following the military does it they are professionally others do it the why i mom mom just defend why it is good for the betterment of phi in the essay you parse words or hazing activities this not a defense of whether or not doing interviews to meet the brothers or having house chores etc is hazing this needs to written as a defense of the benefits of hazing and the positive nature of things such as but not limited night time or any other big brother night with liquor pressure to consume wall sits calisthenics wearing funny clothes and pranks and eating gross or bad food sleep kangaroo courts or other mental late night runs swims servitude activities for older you get the picture in other words use your essay debate and argue for whether or not getting signatures is a

winner have to agree with what the brother writes it just needs to well written argued and neither you or your chapter will be disciplined for submitting an as general council president i offer my word that no brother submits an entry will be subject to discipline by the general or general headquarters i also offer my word that any entry will result in an investigation into activities in your chapter as a of an essay submission for those who know me you know that i by my word this is not a trick or trap this is a sincere only true believers in the benefits of hazing need the purpose of this challenge is not to encourage a brother to write essay defending a point of view they may not believe it this looking for someone to be a advocate this is a challenge those who believe that the effort to hazing is simply wrong and that hazing should be allowed to take in phi delta if you win hand you the fraternity a winning essay will have two significant opportunities to make the case

contact us section the deadline for submissions october please include your name chapter and contact number in your submission so i can contact you with any questions winning essay will appear on the phi delta theta blog not long the why this in some ways this challenge harkens back to the early days of fraternity when a great deal of time was spent in chapter debating the significant issues of the day this was how the members of phi delta theta developed their minds analytical skills persuasive debating talents this is where phis learned to take position defend an idea and become a phi delta theta has taken an active stance against hazing for decades and yet it continues in far too many places i can only conclude it continues because there remain active believers in its practice well as defenders of its continuing use there must be phis who believe phi delta efforts to end hazing are wrong if delta theta is wrong in working to eradicate hazing than it would much better to bring the debate out in the public light and let it the scrutiny of active supreme court justice william o douglas once wrote the way to noxious ideas is with other ideas the way to combat falsehoods with this is an opportunity for defenders of hazing to make their case the phi delt nation that phi delta theta should reconsider our on the i encourage phis who have brothers in their chapters who defend protect hazing practices to share this challenge with those and encourage them to submit an essay it be acceptable defend hazing behind closed doors but not be willing to make a defense for its use in our phikeia education i think it is clear where i and the entire general council stand and have stood for many years personally i believe our effort to end hazing is the right decision for phi delta however i also understand that not all brothers may not agree this position it is those brothers i challenge today with genuine offer of challenging the current position microphone is brother

prevention week phi delta theta scott mietchen comments invitation to nfl commissioner roger goodell please join us in to stop posted on august by by scott mietchen general council hazing as the international president of phi delta theta i that anytime i say or write this word many of our members undergraduate and alumni roll their eyes and expect to hear another lecture on the litany of reasons why hazing has no place in greek movement in general or in our fraternity specifically this piece directed at the members of phi delta theta it is directed at one of the most powerful thoughtful and men in the world of sports roger goodell the commissioner of national football you see while the words fraternity and hazing are often together the problem of hazing exists in many areas of our including professional college and high school athletics i refuse accept the common perception that hazing is just a problem in fact i believe that fraternities and sororities and their respective chapters do more try and combat hazing then any organizations i can think of i that the greek system gets most of the focus and i realize we have to completely end these practices within our own organizations though we have been waging the fight against hazing for however we greeks cannot combat hazing alone without key joining with us to end these stupid pointless harmful and dangerous traditions in fact it makes it more difficult for us combat hazing in our own ranks when the media celebrates acts hazing in shows such as the hbo series hard knocks where humorously profiled hazing in the nfl this past that is why i was so pleased to read this past week that jack del head coach of the jacksonville jaguars has banned hazing this from the jaguars rookie training camp after things got out of hand coach del rio defended his decision by saying that needed to have more respect for each other in order to be teammates and with his simple order hazing stopped in the training camp and just this week jason garrett head coach of dallas cowboys followed suit with a similar ban for his for a coach to take this step in the nfl is important because it trickle down to other nfl teams and then into collegiate and school athletics ask any high school athlete coach or referee hazing and you will hear some incredible stories you can google high school sports hazing and read an astonishing number deplorable stories the nfl serves as a role model to high school collegiate athletes whether it accepts the role or not and hazing is accepted and even celebrated in the nfl it makes it acceptable at the high school and collegiate levels by students that hazing is an acceptable i am asking nfl commissioner roger goodell for help last i wrote commissioner goodell a letter asking for his leadership addressing hazing in the nfl and offering as help phi delta years of experience in fighting the issue that request for help the commissioner and offer of assistance by our fraternity today the nfl sets the tone for many norms in our society and players coaches and owners do indeed serve as role models for youth their leadership on any issue can make a difference leadership to join the fight against hazing just might even save at the time i wrote commissioner goodell last fall there were other things on his plate including the recently completed talks between the players and owners those talks are now the players are back in training camp and the nfl will most likely another record breaking season unfortunately the commissioner an opportunity to ban hazing with the recently completed bargaining while i realize that there is much the office throughout the year on a wide variety of issues i would hope that may see the steps recently taken by the jaguars and cowboys as opportunity to use his position of leadership to begin stamping hazing in the nfl his actions now may help lead to the elimination hazing in other levels of sports which can also help us in our against hazing commissioner goodell has the unilateral ability draw the line in the sand regarding behavioral standards in the nfl authority he has used in the past to deal with other issues which viewed as a threat to the league its players i believe commissioner has the decency to take a stand that can affect of young men and women who may never play in his league and beyond illegality of hazing in many states just stupid wrong not suggesting that we blame hazing within our organization on nfl far from it phi delta theta will continue its to stamp out hazing in our own organization regardless of what do however i am suggesting that the active and vocal leadership commissioner goodell on this issue could impact many parts of for decades to commissioner goodell you have the ability to unilaterally stop in the nfl all it takes from you is the stroke of a pen consider joining us in this effort as it will have very consequences far beyond the gates of the national football

wrong posted on april by by scott mietchen general council i am writing as the international president of phi delta fraternity to express my surprise that such a international publication as the wall street journal would allow a weakly argued article as shutter fraternities for young good to appear on its news pages while the piece could certainly been written as an oped piece expressing the personal point of view it appeared in a section reserved news items in my view the writer exhibited journalistic and logic standards and did a tremendous disservice to millions of current undergraduate alumni members who have exemplary fraternity experiences please let me first let me state that what happened to ms seccuro as undergraduate at the university of virginia years ago is horrible and beyond explanation or excuse and i hope the was appropriately punished but however horrible this event was i agree it was horrible it was not caused because a fraternity at the university of virginia for the same reason that it did happen because the university of virginia is coeducational happened because the young men involved did not know the boundaries they legal moral or ethical between right and the author ms flanagan writes the greek system is dedicated quelling young anxiety about submitting themselves to four of book learning by providing them with a variety of activities drinking drugging espn watching and the mistreatment of women i could not disagree with ms flanagan about her broad and untrue characterization of fraternity men this simply not a description of fraternity life that i recognize as i believe her article commits one of the classic logical fallacies confusing association with as the president of phi delta theta fraternity with nearly undergraduate members and alumni members located in chapters over north american campuses i can state unequivocally that characterization of what we are dedicated to is just wrong and based on a stereotypical view often times reinforced in media through movies such as animal house time to put house to rest a movie nothing more not reality i also state unequivocally that i have never heard of any other or international fraternity dedicated to the activities described in the the vast majority of fraternity men i know do not fit the description at all the men i know serve as campus leaders academic success in the classroom take part in academic graduate at higher levels than men move on to or professional schools at higher levels excel on the athletic or artistic venue and serve their communities this may play a role in explaining why fraternity men generally have a great deal pride and affection for their fraternity as well as i sadly have to agree with ms assessment that abuse alcohol is a significant problem on college campuses today and i have to agree that surveys reveal that this problem can fraternity populations at a higher level than the general body i also agree that abuse of alcohol plays a significant role both men and women in many of the challenges facing today whether it be sexual harassment or abuse academic issues or harmful interpersonal the entire greek movement fraternities and sororities working our partners in higher education has been working to educate members and stem the abuse of alcohol for many years each of the than fraternities has developed own approaches for addressing this serious issue i applaud all these proactive efforts for phi delta theta in addition to education programs we have taken the approach of creating housing and removing alcohol from our chapter houses for the decade for our organization this has worked for fraternities other approaches have i wish that all fraternity chapters across north america offered exemplary experience but that would be dishonest unfortunately chapters have lost their way and digressed from the values around they were created it is then up to each fraternity to hold chapters accountable to the values and beliefs of their organizations i believe most fraternities work to hold individual chapters accountable i know that phi delta theta committed to upholding our founding principles of friendship learning and fraternities have existed and thrived on north american campuses nearly two centuries we have our issues that we continue to and we have never claimed to be perfect however as a former university administrator i would argue that fraternities sororities continue to provide an invaluable learning experience complements the classroom experience and that we continue to the best real life leadership learning laboratory on a as the father of two children one a daughter who is in her junior of high school and just beginning the college search process and other a junior high school son i have to admit that i am proud to that i not only believe in the continuing relevance and importance fraternity and sorority system but that i enthusiastically encourage both my son and daughter to consider if is right for them for phi delta theta we have had a chapter at university of virginia since and have a great deal of pride in accomplishments and characteristics of the men that comprise chapter at i think it is unfortunate that the author would take such a personal experience and use it to demonize and categorize the more undergraduate men as well as millions of alumni who belong college fraternal organizations in north america we all corporate employees for the unethical actions of a few we fire all of the faculty of a university because one plagiarizes thesis we cancel all professional sports because some broke the rules and took drugs we down all organizations because one operated in an manner it just how we do this is the story of a despicable rape and its aftermath not a about fraternities a sound argument is a valid argument with premises this article provided neither please use poor and lack of facts to paint all of us

filed under phi delt general council phi delt volunteers tagged liz seccuro phi delta theta scott wall street journal comments journey from being hazed to being an enthusiastic hazer posted on september by by scott mietchen general council this week serves as national hazing prevention week and as council president i was asked to write about why hazing has no in phi delta theta while it would be easy for me to simply repeat greek mantra outlining the evils of hazing in order discredit hazing practices i wanted to use this opportunity to tell own story with hazing and why i feel so strongly about the need bring an end to these practices you see as a phikeia i was as a new initiate i was an active and enthusiastic hazer as a officer i stopped hazing in our chapter this is a bit of my being i pledged phi delta theta at the university of utah in the fall this was just a few years after the release of animal house i was the poster child for the target market for greek life at the i was the consummate joiner i was bound and determined to involved on campus and even though i come from a background i saw fraternity life as the way to immediately involved on this large public university campus going through rush was split between three fraternities at the end of a very formal week period and ultimately decided to pledge phi delta theta because liked the laid back real and friendly nature of the guys i met guys made me feel welcome and soon after our official pledge ceremony we held our first meeting and were given the requirements to complete in order to initiated our requirements included the usual items read and the phikeia manual meet and learn something about all of the organize a community service event organize a social with a pledge class etc the chapter officers also told us that the pledge as identified by the chapter brothers would be recognized initiation with the low bond number of the pledge class competitive i was determined to earn that low bond now i expected some fun and games throughout my pledge because i had seen them in the movies and i figured they were simply rite of passage that i could tolerate and survive my ultimate however was to earn the low bond number and i worked diligently to that top pledge i played the role to the best of my abilities completed my assignments early i mastered facts about the i met with all of the active brothers i maintained a attitude and i adopted the attitude of grin and bear it through hazing hazing in my chapter extremely physical it primarily mental with some minor physical activities included i paddled forced to do calisthenics or consume massive amounts alcohol or dropped off in the dessert somewhere blindfolded and to walk back for me it was more subtle line ups late night sessions servitude yelling demeaning remarks surprise kangaroo courts etc and i excelled at all of it i could recite greek alphabet backwards and forwards before the match burned finger i could stand with a spotlight in my face at am while being yelled and cursed at by the wimpiest guy in chapter who also happened to be fairly inebriated i could say sir faster than almost anyone and mean it i could memorize poems used to address the brothers as well as to answer the phone knew that i could put up with anything because i wanted to be and i wanted that low bond when it came time for initiation or i put up with a lot wore the dumb clothes ate the horrible food carried items campus gave up sleep lived in squalor and continued to endure games mental hazing included those exercises where we were lead believe we be initiated or that our entire pledge class was failure after five days of sleep deprivation spotlights poor food mind games physical stress and threats i have to admit began to wonder if it was all worth it then just as quickly as started it was over and i was initiated however i am sad to say remember much of my own initiation i was simply too tired mentally frayed to pay attention when initiation starts at and ends at am and occurs after five days of hell there little to remember or cherish i was simply in survival mode but the end i had survived and achieved my goal i had been named best pledge and was rewarded with the low bond number in my class it felt great the pledge program had made me a great unfortunately i had also developed some real enmity toward several the brothers and younger alumni who were the most aggressive hazers the chapter i put on a smile in their presence but i developed respect for them and to this day i have no desire to with them at alumni events i always thought it odd that i had a collection of miscellaneous facts and figures about the fraternity but i had not learned very much about what makes for a strong however i rationalized that perhaps learning about running the too important and once i was initiated i wait have my turn to haze the next pledge class now it was my and now it was my turn to be a not long after being initiated we took our spring pledge class part of my own pledge program i had read the prohibiting hazing it was printed right in the phikeia manual but had bought into the tradition and rite of passage rationales think anything bad would happen it was during the first class after mine that i became a great hazer i could demand play mental games and demean the pledges with the best of them the worst hazer but i held my own not proud of the that i could get in a face at am and yell at because he know how many bricks there were in old north dorm believed that if they really wanted to be phis they needed to earn and that this was just part of the path to membership after all had come through just fine and it was by now i was also on the executive committee and had to learn more about the policies i met first chapter consultant from general headquarters and engaged in heated debate with him about what was and was not hazing i to focus on the specific aspects that made an activity a activity because it made for an endless debate however i could quite bring myself to truthfully evaluate whether it was morally ethically right or wrong quite frankly at the time i thought policies were just set by a bunch of general officers who really know what was happening at the at the same time my pledge class had taken on several key positions and decided to try and really upgrade our chapter and some fraternity awards however to do this we knew we needed to something about our pledge program or perhaps we could just about some of our most cherished traditions in our awards why i stopped the the next fall my sophomore year we took a fairly large pledge and our pledge program contained the same hazing traditions and of passage from previous years and i participated as however this time something happened that changed my our phikeia class had completed their pledge program and was for initiation week it was at this point that one of our keith started to become quiet he had always been somewhat but now it was becoming more pronounced our initiation lasted five days with formal initiation on the last evening the first four days of keith became progressively withdrawn more reserved and more quiet quite frankly several of sleep deprivation stress and mental hazing had dimmed the spark his eyes and we started to get having finished the fun of we were preparing the pledge for their formal initiation except that we had a problem when we to get keith for the initiation ceremony we found him in his curled up in the corner of the pledge room rocking back and forth humming he was he had simply gone beyond his for emotional stress and lack of sleep and was now nearly we were able to get keith to his feet and literally helped him each step of the entire initiation ceremony with one brother on arm whispering in his ears the words he was to repeat we were for keith and scared for ourselves toward the end of the when keith realized that he had been initiated his mental started to improve since the emotional stress of the past five days begun to dissipate however as active members we were concerned for safety and for his reaction and to truthful we were terrified that the chapter would get into we persuaded keith to stay at the chapter house for an additional days after initiation so he could sleep and return to a normal state mind which he did however it was then and there that i saw dangers and banality of hazing on that day i and several of pledge brothers made the commitment to end hazing in our chapter had come with the fact that hazing funny entertaining and it can be very stopping hazing i discovered a very simple truth in our fight to end hazing most the brothers in the chapter really like hazing they just along with it because it was tradition except for a small number hardcore hazers and they were hardcore there was very little against stopping the hazing as officers we simply said no hazing and for the most part hazing ended it discussions at ten chapter meetings or a chapter task force anything else it simply took leaders standing up and saying no hazing hazing is defined as any action taken or situation intentionally or unintentionally whether with or without the of the persons subjected to that action which produces mental physical discomfort embarrassment harassment or generally individuals within chapters with hazing cultures of age or status have the same common reply when asked about practices heard the excuses for years and i can tell you experience that they are simply no one will get funny the they like it they said it was okay if they it helps build team cohesiveness and i went through it a rite of one person can stop some may read this and think there they go again one of those national guys preaching to us again about hazing and you know i would understand that mentality because i felt the same way at time but i would ask you to consider for just a minute the morals safety and potential disasters that might occur should program of hazing go wrong i would ask you to consider if you be so resolute in your opinions if you or your chapter damaged or even lost a brother i would ask you to consider would all be worth it for the sake of tradition i would hope you be so nonchalant in ignoring all of the advice and help available you to end hazing in your if your chapter has a hazing problem i ask you as a brother consider taking just one step please consider being that phi who stands up says no more and stops the hazing your chapter become a better place because of your the an amazing thing happened once we stopped the hazing and improved phikeia education program our chapter got remarkably better we in numbers academics quality chapter operations and several years after these changes took hold my chapter went on to some of the most prestigious awards some of my most loyal and active alumni today come from the pledge classes were spared the indignities of hazing and to this day keith one of my best friends he and his wife have raised a great family he remains a loyal and active phi and as i write this i realize beyond that initiation week nearly years ago he and i have talked about this probably something we would all just please remember and consider hazing proud to be a brother mietchen is the general council

example of how organizations could partner to propose one integrated project concept with distinct scopes of work that the funding agencies could region has established an economic development strategy team comprised of economic development organizations an mep center workforce investment boards wib and american job centers a university or community college and related intermediary organizations to lead the economic development planning efforts a regular basis the team analyzes economic development data and trends to identify industries that hold a comparative advantage for the region or where investment has been increasing as part of this effort the team prepared an asset map and developed a comprehensive regional strategy for growing jobs in key industries the data reveal that the region is continuing to experience growth in the manufacturing sector this validates the thinking because they have successfully encouraged several manufacturers to expand operations locally plus they attracted three manufacturers in the last year strategy team meets to discuss options presented by the make it in america challenge ffo the team reviews their existing asset map and comprehensive regional strategy to assess strengths and weaknesses the team develops a series of specific tasks in the areas of economic development supply chain development and workforce training that best positions the region to attract new investments and expand more manufacturing operations the team strategizes to demonstrate how work in all three of these areas together will grow on the results of their planning efforts the leadership team decides to develop a proposal for funding to support the development and execution of an integrated targeted manufacturing strategy for their region the team has carefully considered the sequence of activities for each of the three project components while the mep center and the wib are ramping up the supply chain and workforce development aspects the infrastructure project will be completed in time and ready for the newly trained workers team outlines three innovative and complementary scopes of work eda applicant the eligible economic development organization decides to focus on updating the existing capacity of infrastructures which is necessary to facilitate the expansion of production capacity of businesses at the industrial park tenants specifically cited lack of water connectivity as a barrier to growth the edo outlines a plan to upgrade these public assets which will benefit the entire manufacturing supply chain nist applicant the mep center decides on two ways to work with current or prospective suppliers for the manufacturer in the targeted industry scouting suppliers in the region to provide market intelligence industry trends and data about the supply chain capabilities and capacity and ability to satisfy requirements of potential new that are considering investing in the region and providing technical assistance to smes ensuring that the suppliers can meet the needs of companies interested in investment and expansion wib applicant is already working in close partnership with the mep center to identify workforce requirements these requirements will be communicated to the local community college to ensure that new entrants and incumbent skills are aligned to the skills demanded by the employer and are up to current industry standards skilled workers ensure that the pipeline of qualified job applicants will support business growth in the region particularly for occupations and industries for which employers are using visas to employ foreign workers see appendix c for more information is this initiative needed overall objective of the challenge is to make it more attractive for businesses to build continue or expand their operations in the united states rather than abroad this national competition up to american communities or regions will become better situated to attract companies to continue operations expand or build in their area resulting in job growth and a stronger economy the challenge will elevate the focus on to one of greater prominence and highlight best practices in promoting job creation and business growth retention and because the make it in america challenge is a coordinated agency effort it will ensure that complementary resources are

funding agencies eda and eta if the team does not request funding from both of these funding agencies the application will be considered and will not be reviewed nist funds available through the make it in america challenge can only be awarded to an existing mep center in good standing as a result all applicants are encouraged to include a nist mep center on their team so that the team is eligible to receive nist funding for projects where an mep center is not reasonably available for example if there is not an mep center located in the nist funds will not be awarded however all applications must propose engagement with appropriate smes and partners to address outreach service delivery and technology commercialization needs of smes see also section ivb of the should dra funding for projects located in the dra service applicants required to submit separate applications to each applicants can apply for eda nist and eta funding at one time through grantsgov applicants must however request funding from each agency and create separate scopes of work for the use of the funds they have requested in order to apply for dra funds applicants must fill out a separate dra application see appendix b of the ffo for more information on how to apply for dra funds an applicant be selected for funding from only one funding agency eg eda but not the others nist and the funding agencies eda nist and eta intend to make their individual awards to the same applicant teams representing approximately projects selected under this competition the one exception will be if projects are located in an area where an mep center is not reasonably available in that case the project team would be unable to apply to nist for funding but could still receive funding from eda and eta in addition dra expects to approve up to three separate awards within the dra region for projects which also leverage funds from the other funding each member of an applicant team need to submit their own sf to all three funding agencies or should the applicant team as a whole submit one sf to all three funding applicant team member should submit an sf to the funding agency or agencies to which they are collectively the applicant team members should be applying for a total funding sources so each of funding agencies should receive an sf from at least one or more are for a single funding the team the one exception to this is if center is not reasonably available to the applicant in that case the applicant cannot apply to nist for funding because only existing nist mep centers are in this instance an applicant not be required to provide an sf to nist the project area be a subset of the region outlined in the comprehensive economic development strategy ceds or alternative eda approved strategic planning applicants have the flexibility to suggest geographies based on demonstrated analysis of quantitative qualitative information about where and how the area targeted for development our applicant team consists of more than one organization which one of us should submit the application package on authorized organizational representative aor for the organization that is applying for eda funds must submit the application package on grantsgov see section vd of the ffo for grantsgov submission applicants regions or industry clusters submit more than one ffo does not restrict the number of distinct project proposals one region or industry cluster can submit however the funding agencies request that applicants refrain from submitting multiple copies of the same application package if multiple copies of an application are received the funding agencies will only review the last application received an organization be part of more than one application team responding to the the ffo does not restrict the number of applicant teams one organization can be a member of or affiliated many organizations should form the applicant application package must be submitted by an organization or a team made up of organizations referred to as the applicant team that individually meet the eligibility requirements outlined in section iv of the ffo for each of the funding sources an individual organization or an applicant team must respond to the three distinct scopes of work for example one organization that met all the eligibility requirements could submit an application package that proposes activities for all funding alternatively two or more organizations known as an applicant team could submit an application for a project that proposes activities with each organization responsible for their portion of the scope of work for each distinct funding an mep subrecipient apply as an mep center for the funds from nist the mep subrecipient does not hold the cooperative agreement with nist mep they are not considered an existing mep center and therefore are not eligible to apply directly for the funds from nist mep the subrecipient could of course serve as part of the team assembled by the existing mep center to address sme needs for the a state agency holds the mep cooperative agreement should the cooperative agreement holder be the prime mep applicant in the the mep center ie cooperative agreement holder be represented in more than one proposal from that ffo says the mep awardee must designate fte to the does this have to be whole person or fte equivalent across several whole fte person should be assigned to the nist mep expects that one designated mep staff member will be responsible and dedicated to the success of this that will require the person assigned to have sufficient time devoted to this project to manage and collaborate our experience suggests that anything less than fte is not i lose points if my applicant team does not include an nist mep as either an eligible applicant or project will consist of one award from each of the federal funding however in the absence of an existing mep center on an applicant team nist funds will not be awarded for projects where an mep center is not reasonably available the applicant or applicant team will still be expected to respond to the scope of work by engaging appropriate smes and partners to address the outreach service delivery and technology commercialization needs of smes is a nist mep center not reasonably reasonably means that there is no mep center that can provide the desired services in the targeted region applicant teams should demonstrate why services are not available from an mep center either because there is no mep center operating in the region at the time of application or other considerations that make including an mep center on an applicant team impractical or other eligible organizations could my applicant team include if there is no nist mep center reasonably available what types of projects can that organization applicant team could include organizations such as industry associations community colleges sbdcs export promotion intermediaries university technology transfer offices or any other organizations that engage smes and partners to address the outreach service delivery and technology commercialization needs of smes those organizations would be expected to propose projects ie provide information or services that serve the needs of smes within the context of the package application package on the grantsgov website only includes application forms for eda where do i find application forms for nist and forms for nist and eta can be found under the tab for the grantsgov make it in america challenge these forms must

by moe stephens general council in case you heard the united states just finished a significant process election time for me always comes with emotions of excitement for potential change or fear of the same as university administrator all of the election coverage also got me think about the election process for fraternities and sororities north america many of you are electing new executive boards and be feeling many of the same emotions i described if you are running for or have recently been elected president your chapter the task before you is likely intimidating exciting full of the i must preface the following with the realization that i am by no an expert in fraternity and sorority life i am well versed and many experiences in this area but it is such a dynamic that i believe you are the experts because you are living that being said i often meet with new presidents and i provide following communicate authentically there are so many different groups a chapter president must communicate with it can be hard remember whom you have brought into the loop if you are what i call authentic communication it matter everyone are bringing to the table will have the same information it require you to be honest with both yourself and your authentic communication is not always the easiest course of action i guarantee you it will only help when the fecal matter hits oscillating device the more trust you have developed with your constituent groups the easier it will be to work through the before you are now living in the fishbowl the phi delta theta chapter the university of washington has a large glassed in dining area call the fishbowl the sidewalk and street right outside are travelled with students and community members passing by the eats there holds social events there and often has special in the fishbowl i have always thought it was great that the could see into the daily life of a phi delt at uw however i also thought about how difficult that might be at times the chapter does in that room is visible and anyone passing by draw their own conclusions about what is happening as a president you are now living in that fishbowl your actions and are being seen and heard often by people you are not even aware watching and listening you are setting an example for your and broadcasting a message to the rest of your community make sure is the right example be certain it is the right make good choices i often end meetings with the phrase make choices outside of the context of sorority and fraternity life simple phrase is much more difficult and open to interpretation as member of a fraternity or sorority it is actually very simple and live the ritual of your organization within your ritual values that are relevant and have withstood the changing times as ed king stated in his classic piece the secret thoughts of because i am a system of values i am therefore an instrument of evaluation my values are clear and absolute and yet difficult emulate to state a few i am honor courage integrity courtesy and i demand self control as well as ambition and what your founders did is take the idea of friendship and move it significant step forward to the concept of commitment as fraternity and sorority advisor i do not think you are going to perfect however i do expect that you and your chapter members about the values of your organization and use them to guide decisions imagine how much easier it would be to make decisions as executive board if you consistently asked the simple question does this align with friendship sound learning or own it you must be willing to accept responsibility for the of your chapter both past and present noted entrepreneur and jim rohn once said you must take personal responsibility you change the circumstances the seasons or the wind but you can yourself once you decide it is time to own it you can begin process of creating positive enjoy the ride being a chapter president is arguably the difficult leadership position on a college campus you are a model a counselor a mentor an administrator an advisor and spokesperson expectations for chapter presidents are high and should be however many chapter presidents get so caught up in all things to all people that they forget to simply be a sister or brother along with the rest of the responsibilities you have as chapter president it is important for you to remember to have take care of yourself and enjoy the my preference for this blog entry would be for this to be conversation and not just me giving advice of course this is not extensive list of advice for new presidents i am not sure one even be compiled i am interested in hearing from all of you because your voice is the one that truly moe has many years of progressive leadership and success in affairs he has traveled the country working for phi delta theta both a leadership consultant and as the director of expansion moe his wife allison and their

biennial convention will be the fourth time that we have met in the capital city for such meeting the other times being in and in this summer we are continuing a tradition of meeting on a interval as a fraternity since our founding years the first the first convention was held just three short years after the of phi delta theta when seven phis met on december at woodruff house in cincinnati at the time there were only chapters in the fraternity while that first convention was different in size and scope from the one we will soon experience purpose was the same to discuss the state of our brotherhood and its from walter b authoritative account the history of delta theta we know that the first convention was conceived in when founder john mcmillan wilson miami wrote to robert morrison miami what can be done as to holding a at say cincinnati next christmas holidays or what do you advise the matter the suggestion was carried out when in november wilson wrote to morrison who was in tennessee at the time convention will be held between christmas and day cincinnati the minutes of ohio alpha for december report order to transact some business of a general nature a motion by unanimous voice to call a convention to be represented by graduate and undergraduate members of the several colleges of order to meet on tuesday morning dec messrs ross and harrison were appointed to report to the convention feasibility of establishing other chapters of fdth the meeting on december st first organized itself by electing is miami president and benjamin harrison miami following the convention benjamin harrison john mcmillan wilson lw ross were appointed to communicate the proceedings of convention to the existing in at the first convention seven undergraduate and alumni gathered to discuss the state of phi delta theta chart its future growth determine policies and procedures and celebrate the bonds brotherhood in just a few weeks more than undergraduate alumni phis will gather for the th time in our history for similar while every phi delta theta general convention has its own characteristics and while no two conventions are the same there customs and traditions that have developed through the years create common experiences for phis in attendance this will be th general convention having been present at every one since when i attended my first convention in st louis as an phi i am pleased to tell you about some customs and traditions that hope you will experience when we gather in washington dc which you to the experiences of previous convention attendees these listed in no particular order or customs and traditions which link us to the convention many decades ago members who attended the general convention the practice of wearing small silver bars to designate the number conventions they had attended these bars when linked resemble ladders as phis attend more conventions the lengthen and provide striking evidence of a phis devotion to fraternity each bar indicates the city and year in which convention took place the phi who has attended the most conventions and has the longest ladder in fraternity history executive vice president emeritus robert j miller new mexico brother miller served as the chief executive for before retiring as executive vice president in in dc brother miller will secure his rd ladder since he has every convention since the centennial convention in while at the convention be sure to take a close look at ladder if asked i bet he may even share a story or two past william morrison great grandson of morrison and robert morrison westminster grandson of morrison visit with robert j miller new mexico who displaying the longest convention ladder in phi delta theta history the convention in opening business session roll think of this as a chapter meeting roll call but larger and impressive during the first business session on friday morning meeting will begin with the traditional roll call of chapters clubs and general officers of the fraternity the roll call conducted by executive vice president robert a biggs georgia and it is always impressive to hear how widespread the is across north america it is especially moving for many when biggs introduces a new phi delta theta chapter to the convention the introduction please welcome to their first biennial name of chapter or a reinstalled chapter with the please welcome back to the fold name of introductions are always special for those undergraduates and who worked especially hard during the biennium to be assist chartering a new chapter and are usually acknowledged enthusiastic executive vice president robert a biggs georgia southern conducts the roll call during the first business session of the convention in memorial one of the most solemn events which takes place during the convention is the conducting of the ritualistic ceremony the ceremony which is open to as well and by many family members and surviving spouses acknowledges those who have entered the chapter grand since the last convention and special notice to those alumni who have previously served the fraternity in a mark h ochsenbein eastern kentucky general president presents the wreath during the convention committee reports and convention since the general convention has held all supreme and powers of the fraternity the convention has three responsibilities and powers they electing the general consideration of judicial enacting laws for the regulation of the fraternity since only general convention may amend the ritual constitution and statutes of the there will be approximately voting delegates in attendance undergraduate chapter delegates holding about of the voting of the convention imagine a big chapter room with voting phi delta theta is a democratic fraternity and in order to conduct the business of the fraternity a number of committees appointed by the general council to consider issues being presented the convention these committees are composed of both undergraduate alumni voting delegates and discuss issues for the convention committee meetings prior to bringing them to the floor for and voting committees include code committee credentials committee procedure committee nominating appeals committee resolutions committee and wardens committee once committee has reviewed an item under its jurisdiction than it can brought to the convention floor where it will be discussed and necessary voted upon just like in a chapter an undergraduate member of the code committee presents legislation to the convention floor during the convention meet the one of the most important responsibilities of the general convention to elect the five men who will lead the fraternity for the next years as members of the general council the men elected to general council are charged to be the legal representative of fraternity and custodian of the property of the fraternity the council shall interpret and administer all laws of the fraternity make such policies and appointments as may be necessary to promote general welfare of the fraternity living within the regulations the constitution and general statutes of the fraternity the elected to the general council chart the course initiatives and direction of phi delta theta for the biennium beyond during the convention delegates have the chance to meet each of the candidates for the general council in the meet candidates forum in this format each candidate rotates through groups of voting delegates to discuss their ideas and thoughts for future of the fraternity and answer questions from delegates elections matter and the the allow delegates to have questions answered learn about the ideas priorities of the individual candidates who are running for and determine whom to vote for in this election decisions and actions of the general council affect many areas of fraternity and this is the time when delegates help determine future of phi delta general council reporter richard e fabritius kent state with a group of delegates during the general convention session to answer questions about the future of fraternity from convention delegates brother fabritius went on to during the general council model imagine being initiated in a large room in front of hundreds of serving as the chapter with the initiation being conducted by general council for a few men this is precisely will happen to them in washington dc during every convention model initiation is conducted and several new brothers are into the fraternity what an honor and privilege for these brothers to share their initiation experience with phis from north several men will sign the bond of phi delta theta and become during the convention much like lou gehrig columbia signed bond of the new york delta chapter on april the gehrig will be on display during the changing of the during every general convention there is a changing of the guard one general council to the next as the general council is charged overseeing the fraternity between conventions this biennial represents an important orderly transfer of leadership and the formal transition will

home chapter while serving an international posted on may by by rich fabritius general my phi delt experience has been filled by the presence of so tremendous volunteers many of them have never gotten a mention in scroll or during a convention but they work hard for our men and alumni brothers day after day been asked to write a fraternity volunteer enriched my experience and my life general my variety of great experiences with many a phi volunteer makes it difficult to comment on one my first contact with the general fraternity was through my president when i was an undergraduate brother george porosky with mercedes benz parked in the street across from the chapter house parking lights on he was a consistent positive presence in chapter patient and ever in control george steered us when we it and let us go when we needed to learn a lesson he hated chapter meetings he thought they were too long an engineer so think some of our ridiculousness was in firm contrast to constitution those meetings were long very long he was right course but they were fun and i remember thinking there was no place on the planet rather be than down in the chapter room sunday nights george is a main figure in my memory of but the volunteer who taught me perhaps my most treasured lesson phi delta theta is brother jim warner jim succeeded george province president of sigma south and prowls the sidelines of ohio for us to this day jim was an adviser at akron with ohio his alma mater just like george when i first met him i was undergraduate and remember meeting him at a kent state now there is a rivalry between akron and kent both and between our chapters so i was a tad perplexed by the presence an at a kent homecoming but when i met jim i quickly that he care about what chapter you were from he about you and he cared about phi delta theta i learned from jim lesson that has led me to this position today on the general i learned that phi delt just about your home chapter and a whole lot more than that i learned that phi delt is international brotherhood not a chapter i learned that you can your home chapter while serving an international brotherhood learned that phi delt is a whole lot bigger than kent university and make no mistake about it i love kent state and never be able to repay jim for the gift he gave me he planted me a curiosity about the larger organization i developed a thirst know our brotherhood beyond the buildings of kent ohio curiosity lead me to intern at the general headquarters which lead employment on the ghq staff while working for ghq i met my wife this day gift returns to me daily i imagine life without phi delta theta i imagine my experience without the deep gratifying experiences had the general fraternity and i imagine being a phi

warner kent state phi delta theta fabritius volunteerism leave a comment do i know when a chapter is living the ritual a mom tells posted on march by by scott as phi delta theta helps observe national ritual celebration week i asked to share some thoughts on what it means to live the ritual realize that from time to time i am asked by administrators parents alumni and undergraduate members to give definitive definition of how i know when a chapter is living ritual of phi delta theta and when i think about this question come to the conclusion that i know when a chapter is living the when a mom tells me so now going to come back to this as judge concept a little bit later but let me first share thoughts on being a fraternity man with a capital it would be easy and completely appropriate for me to define the as achieving the highest grades on campus providing tremendous amount of community service hours and raising a lot of for charity holding a lot of campus leadership positions and the ritual in all chapter meetings and functions and while each these specific acts are visible public and measurable and all good activities that i certainly encourage for me they this idea of the as i think about the three cardinal principles of friendship learning and rectitude laid out by our founders years ago in bond of phi delta theta and supported in the ritualistic that are the backbone of our fraternity they describe to me characteristics of my concept of a fraternity i want to return for a minute to the original view and perception fraternity men by the broader society i have always been struck by visual representation of a fraternity man which appeared over a ago this drawing coincided with a gathering of delts years ago in louisville kentucky at the general convention this illustration was printed in the and was the first editorial cartoon about fraternity convention ever published if you look closely at cartoon see that it characterizes the phi delt as somewhat larger broader and with more presence than the man he walking next to this cartoon represent him as a drunk slob or frat guy but as phi man as a man of character leader of men this phi delt have been featured on tfm frat the founders of phi delta theta were respected leaders of their and outlined for all of us a set of simple beliefs and which if followed lead to a life of honor respect and to me living the ritual becomes instinctive internalized and in the creation of lifelong habits and it begins at initiation president of phi delta theta i have had the opportunity of and installing many of our newest chapters and to each new chapter the installation banquet i offer the following when you were initiated and all signed the bond of phi delta you agreed to live your lives by three simple principles sound learning and moral rectitude i charge each of you here remember and honor those commitments to each other i charge the men phi delta theta to excel in the classroom to the best of your to sit in the front of class engage with your professors and to the academic to excel on the athletic field or performance venue always your best performance and exhibiting exemplary sportsmanship to engage on the campus get involved in student government other student organizations to lead not just to engage in the local community and serve those in to not abuse alcohol women or each last but not least to act in such a manner both and individually that all of your mothers fathers alumni friends will take pride in you as a fraternity if you do that you will have met the obligations you made when signed the so back to the mom as judge concept i know a chapter is the ritual when i hear from the parent of a phi which usually out to be the mother who calls or writes to tell me about her experience in the fraternity these messages sound like having never been involved in a fraternity before both my husband i were both very impressed and proud to see these young men filled enthusiasm and dedication the fraternity has been a experience for him and i know there will be a void once he this the brothers missouri eta missouri western were going to anyway but they went beyond a philanthropy project and made it personal for my family tanner who has a disability is almost are trying to accept that he will never be married he will never a car and may never attend college he will never have the to be a phi delta theta these men have embraced my family and me for that i am eternally grateful missouri eta chapter from the of my heart i love each and every one of you you are and caring and will always be a blessing in my i was admittedly apprehensive when he expressed an interest becoming involved with a fraternity our family had no experience fraternities or sororities and i had some of the typical regarding the greek system his father and i gave our approval with caveat that he must maintain a high grade point average and jeopardize his scholarship since he wishes to attend law school graduation i am proud to say that he is beginning his senior year has retained his scholarship for all four years in large part due the scholastic emphasis and support of the fraternity i have been impressed with the level of involvement of the alumni with undergraduates in phi delta theta they are truly committed fostering the development of these young men and certainly stress virtues that we all wish to instill in our sons honor loyalty responsibility personally i can attest to new levels of and maturity in my son that i believe are directly attributable to involvement in phi delta with time i have become less concerned with seeing it in terms formal activities and more interested in understanding that the of living the ritual is taking place within our chapters when i from a parent with a testimonial like these i know the chapter living the so in closing here are a few things i believe members of phi theta do every day to live the we care for one another and lift each other we challenge ourselves individually to be better men every we challenge each other to rise to a higher we call a brother out when he is going down the wrong we turn our backs on a brother in we celebrate each we believe in words like fraternity honor duty leadership brotherhood love and not we take pride in identifying ourselves as fraternity we believe in the lifetime commitments we made to each other we signed the my hope is that all of our brothers do these things that we strive to live the ritual to the best of our abilities because members of phi delta theta because what phi delts brother mietchen is the general council president scott is a graduate of the university of utah where he earned both his bs mpa he has served the fraternity as a chapter

professional life an advertising guy i work alongside our pr professionals all the as well as practitioners from other agencies fun to work them in building a business building their while there are certainly lessons and observations i can draw upon inform this post in the end i find them a little weightless in context of being a instead i got to thinking about reputations within our fraternity the fraternity world we are very lucky to be phi delts one of the best if not the best reputation in the fraternity today other fraternities envy our organization for a variety reasons our educational programming is among the best out providing our undergrads and alumni volunteers with opportunities for growth and development our undergraduates are the best men walking the hills of college campuses across america our alumni are engaged and give tremendous amounts of talent and treasure to phi delt and most importantly we are willing to make hard decisions for the betterment of the in order to honor and perpetuate the objectives of the immortal other groups envy us because we make hard i personally find strength in the notion that i am a member of organization who is willing to do the right thing which leads me reputation management we owe each other and ourselves the effort be the best we can be to manage our reputations individually and an do you like what you see when you look in the mirror do you feel living up to the challenges of the argue that the best reputation management that can be done making sure you can look yourself in the eye being a phi means better than common and challenging ourselves and our brothers to better than the great thing about phi delt is the expectations are clear and to understand and we know when lived up to the challenge when fallen short falling short is ok falling short means recognize the need for improvement and perhaps some help from brothers in the process what there i was given a book call the edge when i went off to kent state it a compilation of inspirational quotes and stories the was a cleveland area high school wrestling coach with the of my badge it was my most prized possession in college many an rolled when i quoted the edge at a chapter meeting during my chapter meeting before graduating i bequeathed the edge to one of favorite brothers i miss that book but i learned years later collin boetger still has it in his home years since i gave it to that spring night in my favorite passage from the edge is a poem entitles the man in end this post with it i hope you challenge yourself to your reputation by challenging yourself to be the best you can be live a satisfied life knowing that you are accepting the challenge our founders to be more than ordinary more than average in the the only one who will

management and policy at heinz college of carnegie mellon filed under career advice phi delt general uncategorized tagged advice career development chris brussalis phi theta values leave a comment defense of posted on september by by scott mietchen president of the general as many readers of the phi delta theta blog have discovered this is national hazing prevention week and phi delta theta is doing all can to raise awareness about the issue in the past i have about my own experiences of being hazed hazing others and hazing in my own chapter over the years i have sat on both sides many discussions debating the pros and cons of hazing definitions hazing and hazing activities and the appropriateness and of having a culture of hazing within a chapter i hope that others take the time to share their thoughts on hazing in these that our undergraduate brothers give real thought to the expressed but i know that always the case i know that in many chapters across north america there are a certain number of brothers who simply roll their eyes and make some disparaging about yet another lecture on hazing i know that when leaders some chapters stand up in a meeting and propose the need to end that there can often be loud and vigorous to the concept change from some in the and sometimes i wonder why this continues to be an issue in the movement and why some members feel the need to continue hazing to so not going to here a lecture from me today about why is bad today i am writing to extend a sincere and honest to those who believe hazing makes phi delta theta a better the my challenge today directed at those undergraduate brothers either like hazing or have worked to end hazing in their my challenge today is to those brothers who rolled their eyes when thought this was going to be one more lecture chance for the general council president to yammer on about hazing more time my challenge is to those who fight vigorously effectively to keep hazing traditions in here is my challenge and offer to those the phi delta theta blog has become a very effective communication not only for phi delts but for the larger greek community blog are distributed over the facebook fan page to phis the blog posts are also read by other sorority and higher education leaders across north america many entries are and shared through email lists phi delta blog has become a key source for some of leading thought in and about the greek i am offering access to the phi delta theta blog to one member who can write a powerful thoughtful and well reasoned of hazing but there are some parameters and the rules and this is a real this offer is limited to current phi delta theta initiated members it is not open to alumni or the author must write an essay defending which the fraternity will run on the phi delta theta blog next writers can read other blog posts to determine an appropriate the essay does not need to deal with the legality or illegality the essay must discuss at a minimum the following why hazing should be allowed in phi delta why hazing helps create stronger why hazing helps us live up to the principles outlined in the why hazing is philosophically morally and ethically why hazing helps build better analyze and defend the ratio of hazing given that hazing activities have lead to harm injury or even death in cases to those seeking to join greek the essay cannot use the following the military does it they are professionally others do it the why i mom mom just defend why it is good for the betterment of phi in the essay you parse words or hazing activities this not a defense of whether or not doing interviews to meet the brothers or having house chores etc is hazing this needs to written as a defense of the benefits of hazing and the positive nature of things such as but not limited night time or any other big brother night with liquor pressure to consume wall sits calisthenics wearing funny clothes and pranks and eating gross or bad food

word that no brother submits an entry will be subject to discipline by the general or general headquarters i also offer my word that any entry will result in an investigation into activities in your chapter as a of an essay submission for those who know me you know that i by my word this is not a trick or trap this is a sincere only true believers in the benefits of hazing need the purpose of this challenge is not to encourage a brother to write essay defending a point of view they may not believe it this looking for someone to be a advocate this is a challenge those who believe that the

contact us section the deadline for submissions october please include your name chapter and contact number in your submission so i can contact you with any questions winning essay will appear on the phi delta theta blog not long the why this in some ways this challenge harkens back to the early days of fraternity when a great deal of time was spent in chapter debating the significant issues of the day this was how the members of phi delta theta developed their minds analytical skills persuasive debating talents this is where phis learned to take position defend an idea and become a phi delta theta has taken an active stance against hazing for decades and yet it continues in far too many places i can only conclude it continues because there remain active believers in its practice well as defenders of its continuing use there must be phis who believe phi delta efforts to end hazing are wrong if delta theta is wrong in working to eradicate hazing than it would much better to bring the debate out in the public light and let it the scrutiny of active supreme court justice william o douglas once wrote the way to noxious ideas is with other ideas the way to combat falsehoods with this is an opportunity for defenders of hazing to make their case the phi delt nation that phi delta theta should reconsider our on the i encourage phis who have brothers in their chapters who defend protect hazing practices to share this challenge with those and encourage them to submit an essay it be acceptable defend hazing behind closed doors but not be willing to make a defense for its use in our phikeia education i think it is clear where i and the entire general council stand and have stood for many years personally i believe our effort to end hazing is the right decision for phi delta however i also understand that not all brothers may not agree this position it is those brothers i challenge today with genuine offer of challenging the current position microphone is brother

prevention week phi delta theta scott mietchen comments invitation to nfl commissioner roger goodell please join us in to stop posted on august by by scott mietchen general council hazing as the international president of phi delta theta i that anytime i say or write this word many of our members undergraduate and alumni roll their eyes and expect to hear another lecture on the litany of reasons why hazing has no place in greek movement in general or in our fraternity specifically this piece directed at the members of phi delta theta it is directed at one of the most powerful thoughtful and men in the world of sports roger goodell the commissioner of national football you see while the words fraternity and hazing are often together the problem of hazing exists in many areas of our including professional college and high school athletics i refuse accept the common perception that hazing is just a problem in fact i believe that fraternities and sororities and their respective chapters do more try and combat hazing then any organizations i can think of i that the greek system gets most of the focus and i realize we have to completely end these practices within our own organizations though we have been waging the fight against hazing for however we greeks cannot combat hazing alone without key joining with us to end these stupid pointless harmful and dangerous traditions in fact it makes it more difficult for us combat hazing in our own ranks when the media celebrates acts hazing in shows such as the hbo series hard knocks where humorously profiled hazing in the nfl this past that is why i was so pleased to read this past week that jack del head coach of the jacksonville jaguars has banned hazing this from the jaguars rookie training camp after things got out of hand coach del rio defended his decision by saying that needed to have more respect for each other in order to be teammates and with his simple order hazing stopped in the training camp and just this week jason garrett head coach of dallas cowboys followed suit with a similar ban for his for a coach to take this step in the nfl is important because it trickle down to other nfl teams and then into collegiate and school athletics ask any high school athlete coach or referee hazing and you will hear some incredible stories you can google high school sports hazing and read an astonishing number deplorable stories the nfl serves as a role model to high school collegiate athletes whether it accepts the role or not and hazing is accepted and even celebrated in the nfl it makes it acceptable at the high school and collegiate levels by students that hazing is an acceptable i am asking nfl commissioner roger goodell for help last i wrote commissioner goodell a letter asking for his leadership addressing hazing in the nfl and offering as help phi delta years of experience in fighting the issue that request for help the commissioner and offer of assistance by our fraternity today the nfl sets the tone for many norms in our society and players coaches and owners do indeed serve as role models for youth their leadership on any issue can make a difference leadership to join the fight against hazing just might even save at the time i wrote commissioner goodell last fall there were other things on his plate including the recently completed talks between the players and owners those talks are now the players are back in training camp and the nfl will most likely another record breaking season unfortunately the commissioner an opportunity to ban hazing with the recently completed bargaining while i realize that there is much the office throughout the year on a wide variety of issues i would hope that may see the steps recently taken by the jaguars and cowboys as opportunity to use his position of leadership to begin stamping hazing in the nfl his actions now may help lead to the elimination hazing in other levels of sports which can also help us in our against hazing commissioner goodell has the unilateral ability draw the line in the sand regarding behavioral standards in the nfl authority he has used in the past to deal with other issues which viewed as a threat to the league its players i believe commissioner has the decency to take a stand that can affect of young men and women who may never play in his league and beyond illegality of hazing in many states just stupid wrong not suggesting that we blame hazing within our organization on nfl far from it phi delta theta will continue its to stamp out hazing in our own organization regardless of what do however i am suggesting that the active and vocal leadership commissioner goodell on this issue could impact many parts of for decades to commissioner goodell you have the ability to unilaterally stop in the nfl all it takes from you is the stroke of a pen consider joining us in this effort as it will have very consequences far beyond the gates of the national football

wrong posted on april by by scott mietchen general council i am writing as the international president of phi delta fraternity to express my surprise that such a international publication as the wall street journal would allow a weakly argued article as shutter fraternities for young good to appear on its news pages while the piece could certainly been written as an oped piece expressing the personal point of view it appeared in a section reserved news items in my view the writer exhibited journalistic and logic standards and did a tremendous disservice to millions of current undergraduate alumni members who have exemplary fraternity experiences please let me first let me state that what happened to ms seccuro as undergraduate at the university of virginia years ago is horrible and beyond explanation or excuse and i hope the was appropriately punished but however horrible this event was i agree it was horrible it was not caused because a fraternity at the university of virginia for the same reason that it did happen because the university of virginia is coeducational happened because the young men involved did not know the boundaries they legal moral or ethical between right and the author ms flanagan writes the greek system is dedicated quelling young anxiety about submitting themselves to four of book learning by providing them with a variety of activities drinking drugging espn watching and the mistreatment of women i could not disagree with ms flanagan about her broad and untrue characterization of fraternity men this simply not a description of fraternity life that i recognize as i believe her article commits one of the classic logical fallacies confusing association with as the president of phi delta theta fraternity with nearly undergraduate members and alumni members located in chapters over north american campuses i can state unequivocally that characterization of what we are dedicated to is just wrong and based on a stereotypical view often times reinforced in media through movies such as animal house time to put house to rest a movie nothing more not reality i also state unequivocally that i have never heard of any other or international fraternity dedicated to the activities described in the the vast majority of fraternity men i know do not fit the description at all the men i know serve as campus leaders academic success in the classroom take part in academic graduate at higher levels than men move on to or professional schools at higher levels excel on the athletic or artistic venue and serve their communities this may play a role in explaining why fraternity men generally have a great deal pride and affection for their fraternity as well as i sadly have to agree with ms assessment that abuse alcohol is a significant problem on college campuses today and i have to agree that surveys reveal that this problem can fraternity populations at a higher level than the general body i also agree that abuse of alcohol plays a significant role both men and women in many of the challenges facing today whether it be sexual harassment or abuse academic issues or harmful interpersonal the entire greek movement fraternities and sororities working our partners in higher education has been working to educate members and stem the abuse of alcohol for many years each of the than fraternities has developed own approaches for addressing this serious issue i applaud all these proactive efforts for phi delta theta in addition to education programs we have taken the approach of creating housing and removing alcohol from our chapter houses for the decade for our organization this has worked for fraternities other approaches have i wish that all fraternity chapters across north america offered exemplary experience but that would be dishonest unfortunately chapters have lost their way and digressed from the values around they were created it is then up to each fraternity to hold chapters accountable to the values and beliefs of their organizations i believe most fraternities work to hold individual chapters accountable i know that phi delta theta committed to upholding our founding principles of friendship learning and fraternities have existed and thrived on north american campuses nearly two centuries we have our issues that we continue to and we have never claimed to be perfect however as a former university administrator i would argue that fraternities sororities continue to provide an invaluable learning experience complements the classroom experience and that we continue to the best real life leadership learning laboratory on a as the father of two children one a daughter who is in her junior of high school and just beginning the college search process and other a junior high school son i have to admit that i am proud to that i not only believe in the continuing relevance and importance fraternity and sorority system but that i enthusiastically encourage both my son and daughter to consider if is right for them for phi delta theta we have had a chapter at university of virginia since and have a great deal of pride in accomplishments and characteristics of the men that comprise chapter at i think it is unfortunate that the author would take such a personal experience and use it to demonize and categorize the more undergraduate men as well as millions of alumni who belong college fraternal organizations in north america we all corporate employees for the unethical actions of a few we fire all of the faculty of a university because one plagiarizes thesis we cancel all professional sports because some broke the rules and took drugs we down all organizations because one operated in an manner it just how we do this is the story of a despicable rape and its aftermath not a about fraternities a sound argument is a valid argument with premises this article provided neither please use poor and lack of facts to paint all of us

filed under phi delt general council phi delt volunteers tagged liz seccuro phi delta theta scott wall street journal comments journey from being hazed to being an enthusiastic hazer posted on september by by scott mietchen general council this week serves as national hazing prevention week and as council president i was asked to write about why hazing has no in phi delta theta while it would be easy for me to simply repeat greek mantra outlining the evils of hazing in order discredit hazing practices i wanted to use this opportunity to tell own story with hazing and why i feel so strongly about the need bring an end to these practices you see as a phikeia i was as a new initiate i was an active and enthusiastic hazer as a officer i stopped hazing in our chapter this is a bit of my being i pledged phi delta theta at the university of utah in the fall this was just a few years after the release of animal house i was the poster child for the target market for greek life at the i was the consummate joiner i was bound and determined to involved on campus and even though i come from a background i saw fraternity life as the way to immediately involved on this large public university campus going through rush was split between three fraternities at the end of a very formal week period and ultimately decided to pledge phi delta theta because liked the laid back real and friendly nature of the guys i met guys made me feel welcome and soon after our official pledge ceremony we held our first meeting and were given the requirements to complete in order to initiated our requirements included the usual items read and the phikeia manual meet and learn something about all of the organize a community service event organize a social with a pledge class etc the chapter officers also told us that the pledge as identified by the chapter brothers would be recognized initiation with the low bond number of the pledge class competitive i was determined to earn that low bond now i expected some fun and games throughout my pledge because i had seen them in the movies and i figured they were simply rite of passage that i could tolerate and survive my ultimate however was to earn the low bond number and i worked diligently to that top pledge i played the role to the best of my abilities completed my assignments early i mastered facts about the i met with all of the active brothers i maintained a attitude and i adopted the attitude of grin and bear it through hazing hazing in my chapter extremely physical it primarily mental with some minor physical activities included i paddled forced to do calisthenics or consume massive amounts alcohol or dropped off in the dessert somewhere blindfolded and to walk back for me it was more subtle line ups late night sessions servitude yelling demeaning remarks surprise kangaroo courts etc and i excelled at all of it i could recite greek alphabet backwards and forwards before the match burned finger i could stand with a spotlight in my face at am while being yelled and cursed at by the wimpiest guy in chapter who also happened to be fairly inebriated i could say sir faster than almost anyone and mean it i could memorize poems used to address the brothers as well as to answer the phone knew that i could put up with anything because i wanted to be and i wanted that low bond when it came time for initiation or i put up with a lot wore the dumb clothes ate the horrible food carried items campus gave up sleep lived in squalor and continued to endure games mental hazing included those exercises where we were lead believe we be initiated or that our entire pledge class was failure after five days of sleep deprivation spotlights poor food mind games physical stress and threats i have to admit began to wonder if it was all worth it then just as quickly as started it was over and i was initiated however i am sad to say remember much of my own initiation i was simply too tired mentally frayed to pay attention when initiation starts at and ends at am and occurs after five days of hell there little to remember or cherish i was simply in survival mode but the end i had survived and achieved my goal i had been named best pledge and was rewarded with the low bond number in my class it felt great the pledge program had made me a great unfortunately i had also developed some real enmity toward several the brothers and younger alumni who were the most aggressive hazers the chapter i put on a smile in their presence but i developed respect for them and to this day i have no desire to with them at alumni events i always thought it odd that i had a collection of miscellaneous facts and figures about the fraternity but i had not learned very much about what makes for a strong however i rationalized that perhaps learning about running the too important and once i was initiated i wait have my turn to haze the next pledge class now it was my and now it was my turn to be a not long after being initiated we took our spring pledge class part of my own pledge program i had read the prohibiting hazing it was printed right in the phikeia manual but had bought into the tradition and rite of passage rationales think anything bad would happen it was during the first class after mine that i became a great hazer i could demand play mental games and demean the pledges with the best of them the worst hazer but i held my own not proud of the that i could get in a face at am and yell at because he know how many bricks there were in old north dorm believed that if they really wanted to be phis they needed to earn and that this was just part of the path to membership after all had come through just fine and it was by now i was also on the executive committee and had to learn more about the policies i met first chapter consultant from general headquarters and engaged in heated debate with him about what was and was not hazing i to focus on the specific aspects that made an activity a activity because it made for an endless debate however i could quite bring myself to truthfully evaluate whether it was morally ethically right or wrong quite frankly at the time i thought policies were just set by a bunch of general officers who really know what was happening at the at the same time my pledge class had taken on several key positions and decided to try and really upgrade our chapter and some fraternity awards however to do this we knew we needed to something about our pledge program or perhaps we could just about some of our most cherished traditions in our awards why i stopped the the next fall my sophomore year we took a fairly large pledge and our pledge program contained the same hazing traditions and of passage from previous years and i participated as however this time something happened that changed my our phikeia class had completed their pledge program and was for initiation week it was at this point that one of our keith started to become quiet he had always been somewhat but now it was becoming more pronounced our initiation lasted five days with formal initiation on the last evening the first four days of keith became progressively withdrawn more reserved and more quiet quite frankly several of sleep deprivation stress and mental hazing had dimmed the spark his eyes and we started to get having finished the fun of we were preparing the pledge for their formal initiation except that we had a problem when we to get keith for the initiation ceremony we found him in his curled up in the corner of the pledge room rocking back and forth humming he was he had simply gone beyond his for emotional stress and lack of sleep and was now nearly we were able to get keith to his feet and literally helped him each step of the entire initiation ceremony with one brother on arm whispering in his ears the words he was to repeat we were for keith and scared for ourselves toward the end of the when keith realized that he had been initiated his mental started to improve since the emotional stress of the past five days begun to dissipate however as active members we were concerned for safety and for his reaction and to truthful we were terrified that the chapter would get into we persuaded keith to stay at the chapter house for an additional days after initiation so he could sleep and return to a normal state mind which he did however it was then and there that i saw dangers and banality of hazing on that day i and several of pledge brothers made the commitment to end hazing in our chapter had come with the fact that hazing funny entertaining and it can be very stopping hazing i discovered a very simple truth in our fight to end hazing most the brothers in the chapter really like hazing they just along with it because it was tradition except for a small number hardcore hazers and they were hardcore there was very little against stopping the hazing as officers we simply said no hazing and for the most part hazing ended it discussions at ten chapter meetings or a chapter task force anything else it simply took leaders standing up and saying no hazing hazing is defined as any action taken or situation intentionally or unintentionally whether with or without the of the persons subjected to that action which produces mental physical discomfort embarrassment harassment or generally individuals within chapters with hazing cultures of age or status have the same common reply when asked about practices heard the excuses for years and i can tell you experience that they are simply no one will get funny the they like it they said it was okay if they it helps build team cohesiveness and i went through it a rite of one person can stop some may read this and think there they go again one of those national guys preaching to us again about hazing and you know i would understand that mentality because i felt the same way at time but i would ask you to consider for just a minute the morals safety and potential disasters that might occur should program of hazing go wrong i would ask you to consider if you be so resolute in your opinions if you or your chapter damaged or even lost a brother i would ask you to consider would all be worth it for the sake of tradition i would hope you be so nonchalant in ignoring all of the advice and help available you to end hazing in your if your chapter has a hazing problem i ask you as a brother consider taking just one step please consider being that phi who stands up says no more and stops the hazing your chapter become a better place because of your the an amazing thing happened once we stopped the hazing and improved phikeia education program our chapter got remarkably better we in numbers academics quality chapter operations and several years after these changes took hold my chapter went on to some of the most prestigious awards some of my most loyal and active alumni today come from the pledge classes were spared the indignities of hazing and to this day keith one of my best friends he and his wife have raised a great family he remains a loyal and active phi and as i write this i realize beyond that initiation week nearly years ago he and i have talked about this probably something we would all just please remember and consider hazing proud to be a brother mietchen is the general council

endy he is an assistant professor at stanford university dr endy is the director biofab an open facility advancing biotechnology and he is president of the biobricks foundation as well as being a member of national committee on science technology and law endy we are happy to have you here with us today why you drew thank you chairwoman gutmann vice chairman wagner and members of given the limited time i prepared nine slides which like to and quickly go through been asked to speak on the overview context of the technology of synthetic biology and in framing remarks like to recognize that the technology is stewart brand has noted that if we think of this century the century as a century of biology it must also be a century bioethics let me express my gratitude to you and to the commission investing your life energy in starting the process here in the stages of synthetic this is a cover or derived version of the cover from the economist response to the article coming from the team at the venter institute science it follows in the tradition of press coverage biotechnology about years ago when jacques loeb and his team working on artificial parthenogenesis the initiation of development the absence of a sperm that achievement received similar popular attention and it creates many questions in the minds diverse publics such as is life being created from scratch are recapitulating in the laboratory spontaneous generation and so and so i want to simply acknowledge this at the outset of my technical and express my own opinions that at this point life has not now created from inanimate matter i believe this is a subject for a lot discussion but i want to share this so that i can move on to what consider to be very important practical technical matters and ethics associated with i believe that the capacity to synthesize genomes and to install in replicating cells is what an engineer which is what i am call a btd a big technical deal i think dan gibson and latreague the doctors who are the first authors of the work at venter institute deserve high praise for their accomplishments i only now imagine some of the reasons i think this is a big deal and what like to do is give you an abstract framework in addition some examples for this so that in your work you might find the in my own this little cartoon i drew shows how life works natural living exist via this process of direct descent and replication from parents to ourselves to our children if we are so fortunate so we familiar with this how we inherit and are part of the the technologies within synthetic biology including synthetic allow for a very interesting alternative path you can take an and sequence it and that converts the physical genetic material information that can be stored on a database and a computer which means that we can change it and edit it as information and the technology of synthesis of dna which come back to allows the genetic material to be recompiled if that can be established in cellular chassis and replication initiated off life goes so these two tools reading and writing of dna allow part of material of life the genetic material to be decoupled from physical process of replication and this decoupling then allows synthetic living systems which are derived from natural systems based on their designs to be this means that the selections have to be natural they can be fashioned selections for solving important problems decoupling has been demonstrated for some viruses and now with the from the venter institute a why is this a big deal well stresses can arise when material information become for example you might familiar with music and entertainment and video when music available on compact disks the distribution of the material as as compact disks is how the markets were defined how sharing ownership were defined and so on but as soon as the encoding the music was separated from the compact disk and available as mp files or digital music files over a network created a tremendous number of changes you had napster as a sharing service and as a president of a university all of a copyright violations by your students might become a problem you the itunes store today and so it also challenges safety and security frameworks where if you want limit access to a gene encoding a toxin by only having experts with that what if you make that sequence available on the internet now somebody could print the gene or a pathogen and so on being to go from material to information and back to material can stress change current practices and relationships part of the this capacity of construct and reinstall and initiate replication of genome is a big deal come back to let me go into the technology just a bit these four bottles show basis of dna in a form known as phosphoramidites and this is based the work of marvin caruthers and his colleagues in colorado ago so the four bases are a t c and g the nucleotides of dna bottles cost about each the materials are derived from what happens with this material is you hook it up to a machine is a very outdated picture this machine is called a dna you can see the bottles of chemicals hooked up to that machine what this machine will do is take information coming in over a network and organize the dispensing of the chemicals in a order the order that you want and so if you would like to print scratch a particular sequence of dna you enter that into the and the machine will dispense the chemicals in that order and to degree that the machine can successfully construct call oligonucleotide you will get that physical piece of genetic so this is the essence of one of the directions or dimensions of technologies in synthetic biology the ability to go from that describes the dna sequence to physical genetic my limited opinion i believe that the capacity to and construct dna is the most currently the number one and important technology of the st century the only thing i imagine that would trump this would be some source of clean fuel this is equivalent in importance in my opinion to the to manufacture silicon wafers and computing i think our economy our security and our ethical leadership will be depend on prowess at being able to compile genetic we go from abstract information to physical living design i want talk a little bit about where we have come and where this might because again i think the change of capacity here is very and means that the committee is unlikely in my opinion to sufficient all of the existing and past bioethics work in the i think there is new stuff happening that warrants to be specific about six years ago the longest fragment of material that had been constructed from scratch was base small bacterial viruses today with dan gibson and colleagues their work at the venter institute we have now seen published megabase a million base pairs of dna constructed from scratch a fold improvement in six where should we expect to be six years from now well the extrapolation which may not come true and is worth discussion be times greater million base pairs of material million base pairs of genetic material is most known microbes all the ones i know about yeast and almost as big as the worm or the fly and just below the average length of a human chromosome mean going to know how to weave a worm or fly a fly hammer out a human but it means going to have the capacity tinker at the level of genetics that is the more technical context shown here is a gap this gap about meters we have a much bigger gap in synthetic biology down the technical weeds of the work on the left trying to what i believe to be the case today that of all engineering projects can be encoded by less than base pairs designer dna which is about a dozen or so functional components so the biotech industry that we are familiar with is today making engineered genomes and delivering products to on the right we now see that we have the capacity to construct scratch a million base pairs of dna and researchers in japan reassembled from natural fragments million base pairs of dna are not designer genomes these are recapitulations of sequences but the magnitude of these construction projects significant you could encode thousands of components here i know how to put together a thousand different dna components others here can teach me and that would be fantastic but in context what we find as engineers or engineers of biology have a fold gap that is we could right now the construction technologies that exist we could struggle and try hope to get times better at putting together the pieces of dna order to do useful very early and going to be a long haul i think to better at putting this stuff back into place let me try and give some context from a different area so characters that you things like the gettysburg address which is around characters it gets you an editorial in the new york times and almost gets you dan paper which is about what would be you know the sort of stuff you could write with million characters well you certainly get plays like exit you get the color purple which is not even a million you even get war and peace as a novel one of the things to through and imagine as a future in genomics and empowers biology what do we do to write genomes either to learn or do things one of the exciting pulls let me put this in context here are some teenagers who when they encountered biotechnology like how it smelled literally odor so they wanted to write a simple genetic program the cells are growing smell like wintergreen otherwise smell bananas you can do this by getting cells to manufacture salicylate which smells like wintergreen or isoamyl acetate chemical odor that smells like bananas just because we can the genome make it easy to compile the dna that implements simple genetic program what would the letters be do start with a t an a or c or so one of the challenges of technologies beyond the tools building also going to need to invent and develop the and grammars that allow us to write dna programs or poems a research shown here are three of the core technologies that powered the generation of genetic engineering recombinant dna for cutting pasting polymerase chain reaction for amplifying materials and sequencing for reading out the code in synthetic biology we see the leadership of synthetic genomics a technology platform for dna and genomes this allows some people to become experts as and other people to become experts as builders like an architect and contractor very different from current practice where people need to be expert in both activities we may have some other technologies coming online abstraction leads to languages and grammars and standards that allow people define genetic elements in a way that makes sharing easier ends up being the case i believe that to have a chance at ethical we must leave the future development of the tools sometimes ethical matters are but i think they are gray and very practically to resolve and lead the of ethical questions you have to have a stake in the game so my last slide i want to make some couplings as an engineer practically to ethical matters i encounter we often learn best tinkering i overstate how little we know about biology and much we stand to learn by trying new things out one thing to a car apart and see what all the pieces are and you sort of how a car works but if you put the car back together and you have some things out when you turn the key a big deal if it or not because you have learned something new about the just our capacity to build dna is going to let all sorts of and researchers learn more and become better engineers of a value an innate value that must not be overlooked in freedom of the press in this case i mean the dna press ability to synthesize dna in genomes is like a printing press but for the material that encodes much of life if one publisher all the presses that would give a publisher tremendous leverage very interesting to me that so far as i know there are sustained public investments at getting better at building dna presses which means that the public input into the discussion commissions such as this and other venues is practically institutions and individuals hackers are community so engineer a civil engineer by training i like to build stuff i for amtrak one summer fixing bridges between here and biology is the most compelling manufacturing technology i have seen not the only person who thinks that most of the people coming after me they are much younger they see a nanotechnology works taken over the planet life constructive we can imagine being inspired to get better at programming it with the tools of synthetic biology then find these communities and them because they are accessible technologies oftentimes we have very significant responsibility as leaders in ethics in technology science to enable and partner with or ostracize these communities we invent a world of biotechnology which i think what trying to do or do we push people out to the margins cut them off and create the consequences of that sort of lastly preparedness and reconciliation biosafety accidents happen we have the gene therapy experiences from penn more will occur we have the anthrax attacks from nature is not same as a representative liberal democracy and that creates a between our expectations and duties to protect the rights of individual in a world that oftentimes can be cruel how do we this and not make such truths thank you very amy thank you very i know how many of you recognize this but i think it does not without saying dr endy you did a truly extraordinary job synthesizing succinctly the science and your perspective on it thank you very much for and there will be more in time for moving on our next speaker is dr bonnie bassler dr bassler is howard hughes medical institute investigator she is the professor of molecular biology at princeton university dr bassler also the president of the american society for microbiology winner of the princeton university award distinguished teaching and the recipient of the wiley prize biomedical i could go on with dr honors but instead i will welcome somebody i have known for more years than like to much younger than i am welcome dr bonnie thank you dr gutmann so pleased that the commission has asked by the president to consider the benefits risks and issues related to the field of synthetic biology i have been asked compare and contrast the engineering perspective with that of biological and genetic sciences and to explain approaches by synthetic biology and how they differ from other approaches biological manipulation in addition i will cover what has accomplished in the field and what i think are important obstacles the advancement of synthetic every living organism including simplest life form bacterium is loaded with molecular devices that are their design complexity and efficiency even to our most engineers and physicists as a microbiologist i offer a few from the bacteria bacteria have miniature motors that operate boat engines complete with propellers the motors use a called atp as fuel this contraption allows cells to swim liquid at a pace that given their size would make michael when bacteria settle out of their liquid world on to a surface example in the ocean when they find themselves in the sediments perhaps when they encounter a droplet of oil they sense that have they sense that they need another form of transportation sprout thousands of appendages like spider legs to crawl surfaces when they leave the surface to return to the environment these legs fall off and the boat propeller reengages are the perfect amphibious turning to information flow inheritance and cellular bacteria have similar equipment machines are from component proteins one such apparatus can rapidly copy nucleotide base that constitutes the genome in the process proofreads every letter how accurate is the proofreader if the being typed at a reasonable rate say words per minute and human being typed continuously for eight hours a day five days a it would be as if he or she made one mistake every copying the genetic code or the dna is not sufficient for life happen the biological machinery of a cell must convert information embedded in the dna molecule into complete take our best understood bacterium ecoli there are thousands elements that the proteins synthesize or allow the cell to acquire the environment that are essential for life to name a few lipids required to build the membrane that encapsulates and protect contents of the cell nutrients must be consumed to remake parts wear out atp nadp and phosphate are a must for supplying energy list goes on and on i repeat that none of these cellular are made directly from dna or directly from lastly these cellular components are not swishing around rather there is precise spatial organization to each part and provides asymmetry another feature we understand is essential life even in bacteria without asymmetry no embryo could develop neurons could not process information our intestines could not nutrients and bacteria could neither swim nor crawl indeed cells even bacterial cells possess architectures which the component parts are put in specific places at specific biologists have a natural desire to pick apart and analyze amazing life processes to understand how the natural world engineers have a natural desire to exploit these living structures build increasingly useful apparatuses thus the intersection the synthetic biology field is synthetic biology builds on traditional genetic engineering but a fundamental difference traditional biologists research at the scale synthetic biologists promise to the foundational knowledge acquired by traditional biologists using principles from engineering refine excel and apply it at that could achieve unprecedented good for the public we now have hope of efficiently applying biological solutions to some of grandest problems facing the synthetic biology is taking the natural course one expects excellent scientists from two disciplines combine their talents we this happening all over in science today especially in biophysics chemical biology computational biology and biology so why right now do we need a series of ethics hearings synthetic biology what are the benchmark questions that arise synthetic biology that do not arise in these other interdisciplinary the catalyst for convening these hearings was the publication science magazine of a manuscript entitled creation of a bacterial controlled by a chemically synthesized genome why does manuscript cause unease to address this i examined what accomplished in this publication the authors have to their credit assembled the largest piece of dna to however to replicate the synthesized dna the authors required living cell complete with the requisite thousands of components all of the biological machines required were assembled and functioning every cellular component was sitting exactly the correct place in the cell and primed for operation membrane was present to house both the introduced dna and its functions so that the second round of replication could occur authors used a bacterial genome that had gone through billion of refinement to which they made only modest changes this dna all of the instructions for assembling working machines for precisely timed production and destruction of each component and spatial localization of each to put the present work into context i remind the commission that arthur kornberg a nobel prize winning scientist and colleagues synthesized and replicated the virus cx genome in exploiting the bacterial component housed in a living cell accomplishment is strikingly the genome replicated in is significantly larger than the from that is no surprise given years of technological also between then and now there have been thousands of experiments labs all across the world in which sequences of dna have synthesized and introduced into cells and the cells dutifully out the instructions provided in the dna thus the recent provides us an incremental technical step forward in dna synthesis assembly what the work does not do is provide information or about the nature of is there any technology or finding in this manuscript that should us ethical unease my answer is no any anxiety i have regarding work stems from the use of a misleading title creation of a bacterial cell and some ensuing sensationalist that occurred in the popular the authors did not create they cloned given the title and some the news coverage of this paper it is understandable that makers and the public are concerned the title does not represent scientific findings in the paper the title has unnecessarily scientists are committed to performing research that is in the interest and they have a responsibility to articulate accurately findings and the implications of their research i hope through hearings and the work of the commission we can move past the and focus on the future of this field and any genuine ethical it to finish i go back to the science of synthetic biology there wonderful news ahead for this field even with our understanding of complexity we do understand many things are now able to logically string together biological and get them to perform new functions we can engineer organisms to or to produce useful things we can build entirely new functions do not to our knowledge occur in nature such research tremendous promise for the future of renewable energy new synthesis a sustainable environment food and synthetic biology is however a young field and it faces hurdles first one concerns reliable function even when scientists believe know the components in a particular pathway when we put them using synthetic biology they often fail to mimic the performance of the device natural systems do not fail when conditions change rather they adjust to new environments we do understand why synthetic circuits are flimsy and natural circuits there are three components in the circadian clock that give oscillations associated with the hour cycle the clock is exceptionally precise the period is exactly hours and lasts the lifetime of the organism when synthetic oscillators built by macarthur fellow and cal tech professor michael elowitz his colleagues are introduced into bacteria they oscillate synthetic oscillators only function in a subset of cells they extreme variation between cells after a handful of oscillations synthetic machines stop what is important is that we are learning how to build these and we now have some early synthetic machines in hand studies of sturdy natural systems and their brittle counterparts will provide us two things a deeper understanding robustness in natural systems and the ability to increasingly precise and reliable biological another challenge facing the synthetic biology field concerns typically when we introduce nonnative parts into compel them to carry out new jobs we weaken them these tasks with a fitness price at present at the test tube level many processes work reliably in however at larger or in competitive arrangements either get rid of engineered pieces or they are outcompeted by their natural when the forces of natural selection provide new traits the exhibit enhanced vigor when human engineer synthetic parts we make them in summary the promise of synthetic biology is great but notorious complexity and of biological systems the delicate balance that needs to be struck for these systems to viable makes the engineering approach extremely challenging but we only in the early we need to move these studies forward and we need to keep our focus the bacteria bacteria provide humanity a virtually untapped of spectacular devices and ingenious pathways their surpasses everything else on the planet we know there are millions millions of genes in the microbial world and we have no clues as their functions that means there already exist millions of molecules of medical industrial and agricultural relevance exist millions of biological devices awaiting discovery in prototypes for constructing real machines bacteria are our only limitless renewable resource and scientists have only studied few of them as a nation we have to take this resource seriously as significant part of our future we certainly need ethical oversight regulation but we need it applied in a practical and creative way balances the merits and concerns of scientific achievement and to sensationalism in the media if we can have that scientists but especially in this case biologists and engineers continue to work to enhance human by understanding appropriately harnessing the power and diversity of the natural thank amy thank you very much dr bassler i think you get a glimpse here of important it is to bring engineering and biology together and both different perspectives but also the interaction and very interconnected perspectives so thank you very much for that we now turn to our last speaker for this session dr rob carlson rob carlson is a principal with biodesic a and design firm dr carlson is the author of a very accomplished important book biology is technology the promise and new business of engineering life dr carlson writes on preparedness on synthetic vaccines and other robert okay well first chairman gutmann and members of the committee you very much for the invitation honored to be here i am also in the fortunate position of following two introductions so going to take a very different perspective and go into sort of higher level context for how the world is and as synthetic biology is itself a conglomeration of tools it is tool in itself to be used in producing systems that have defined behaviors i am going to take a step outside of the immediate context and show you a car commercial to start with and the audio here is not important but this is my favorite car commercial of all time it is beautiful synopsis of what we mean by the word engineering in modern what you see here is a honda element slowly coming together bricks and the very end of this piece a very that says every piece has its purpose this works in my opinion because it brings together our expectations how engineering functions all these individual pieces have functions they are understood we combine them together in a system and then we understand how that system works too the piece missing from this is that of course there are hands and human intent in engineering and where the issues come the reason i start with this commercial is that its understanding engineering drives our economy today this is how we build everything in our world today we have computer models we computer manufacturing and stuff gets moved around the world we this march from consumer electronics and the speed with which comes to the world is due to the facility we have in designing building objects of course we have none of that for biology nonetheless in hierarchy of engineering and economic complexities starting with single cell and recombinant dna we can make enzymes drugs materials starting to build systems that have multiple genes a single cell type someday down the road we may be relying synthetic single cells or maybe something a chassis cell that will provide the metabolic products synthetic circuits to make more complex materials somewhere down road have multiple cells contributing to growth differentiation of everything from tissues new tissues in our perhaps larger objects someday we may grow i would note that not the case however that all of this somehow off in the future somewhere the top corner a of a woman claudia castrilla who two years ago had her replaced by an transplant there was a donor whose stem cells were stripped from it and her cells were seeded it it was differentiated in the lab and transported doing well last week we had the first announcement of induced pluripotent cells made from peripheral blood and the first announcement of transplant that was designed to differentiate inside the body of young boy it was put into it look anything like stem today in that they are different technologies but it be too before they come together and that has to be on your radar as nonetheless despite the fact that we are very early in this just barely beginning to get ahold of how to build things biological systems in the us today we derive the equivalent of our gdp from genetically modified stuff a big number about the same as we derive from mining today broken into areas genetically modified crops in the us market revenues those crops are about billion a year a low estimate only includes cotton soy and corn if you include alfalfa and genetically modified sugar beets come back another or so genetic drugs are about billion the biggest part industrial biotechnology fuels enzymes and materials faster and much less regulated and much closer to the consumer i that economic activity is going to drive a lot of the uptake development of biological technologies especially synthetic so the next important thing to note is that not the only who are going down this road the numbers for other countries are of hard to come by these are the best estimates from my firm so and we continue to refine these china supposedly is at about their gdp already from biotech and they have a target of in years malaysia claims this year and they have a target of gdp by i know that i really believe either of numbers but published india and pakistan each substantially smaller numbers pakistan is interesting because all of that until this year was unapproved genome cotton made somebody else but pirated essentially and brought into the europe basically looks like the us except of course they have much in the way of genome and the definition of biotechnology is very different all over world different agencies in the us government use definitions the oecd has a particular definition that includes other than genetically modified products so hard to sort exactly going on here but these are my best estimates so not going to spend a lot of time going through the slide the is there are all kinds of different drivers for people to adopt develop biological technologies it has particular technologies and set of this set of technologies is international and distributed already looks like brewing beer than it does like oil production we might open source biology at some point here in the future if we can out the legal issues and there are many uncertainties as to how goes forward to have mostly to do with investment and how fast really want to we heard earlier about the importance of reading and writing dna are both improving exponentially that is the productivity of reading dna and writing dna have been improving exponentially for than two decades now the cost of reading dna and of writing genes particular from scratch has been falling exponentially that an important impact on our economy yet because been too so to really get ahold of it and to really use broadly that i showed you have any synthetic biology in it recombinant dna techniques it is coming revenues from biology are maybe a couple of million dollars a year at this all and instruments and what so now on to what do you do with that dna you can stick together the little pieces you can make using dna synthesis and them together and make genomes the longest accomplished synthetic over the last years and it clear how much longer the game go on once we get another order magnitude we are at the level human chromosomes and building a human chromosome from scratch is extremely complex endeavor and it clear that just making dna you anywhere but all that said it seems like this is from publication i helped write a few years ago we have had a rate of increase and penetration into the economy and we have all of new tools coming online that can radically change the rate at we make progress both building these systems for trial and error learning what not and building components of the again not going to go through all this but this is one version a chart of how we might make all kinds of different biofuels and in opinion going to need all these different energy sources if truly want to have renewable energy in this country we need all this stuff there are some industrial chemistry on here and a whole of biology on this chart we accomplish the goal of independence particularly if using biological sources of unless we get all of similarly i go into details this is a timeline from the outbreak essentially what i have done is look at the diagnostic and sort of action events in the sars outbreak what find is we were technologically unprepared for this and unprepared for natural outbreaks we need much better technology identify threats to understand threats and to respond to whether they are natural or as is inevitably the case threats the only way going to get there in my opinion is have innovation everywhere and anywhere as fast as we can and the way technology development has always worked in this is the us small business administration list of technologies that spent some of their time in the garage in development cycle and i think biology has to be the same way in for us to get where going to go where we need to briefly instructive to think about aviation in our context beginning of aviation there was in fact no government investment like no government investment now in synthetic biology in us anyway and there were distributed innovators they talked to other and each had different ways of going about their strategy and met with different results one was making flights berlin and had the story of air foils those happened to be and he died in a resulting crash samuel langley had a particular a particular mathematic duration called law which said faster you go the lower the air resistance so that led to a strategy and led to his airplanes often folding up as soon as they my point there is that going to see all kinds of innovation and most of not going to work out eventually wright talking to octave chanute or whoever else is there they are going to get biological technologies working but going to take a long aviation took almost years before it became truly important in economy that said biology is already distributed this is a of gene synthesis foundries these are companies selling gene services since been a lot of consolidation there four major providers of gene synthesis service you them a sequence and a credit card and they fedex you the dna two later there are only four now driven by economics but i there are any technical barriers to additional participants that if you want to set up shop anywhere in the world with a new technology you need any special environment you need special drew mentioned students building genetically modified systems igems this is a map of countries from igem the competition increased every year i am fortunate to be a judge and the usually surprise me sometimes they scare this year there are teams registered so far drew is that drew robert now international teams have won in the past this is by no an activity dominated by the united states or by europe school students and undergraduates get together every year and try build systems that have defined how many genes are enough well so this is the sort of technical perspective on the comments we just heard the project jay work at berkeley at amyris to make a drug in yeast genes from four organisms way north million if you include the biofuels spinoff not a hack have to rebuild it in a different organism and spend same amount of money but get biofuels out of twelve genes the gibson paper describes roughly genes drew i have no idea how to do anything with genes and it took whole bunch of really skilled people to do something interesting genes for this the last thing i want to do is say something about regulation your remit necessarily to think about prescription regulation but think the impacts of regulating are important to think about here so think drugs are illicit drugs are an important model to so most of the cocaine that comes into the us or to of cocaine that comes into the us depending on whether you believe us navy or us coast guard comes in some point of its journey in those cost a couple of million at best to build carry million in cargo the drug smugglers may have moved on fully submersible submarines one was discovered last finish in just a moment and a focus of development effort that was prompted by an attempt to production and distribution technologies the same thing happened methamphetamines the own reporting on what happened when tried to crack down on domestic methamphetamine production is that created a bigger blacker market that is much harder for them penetrate and not asserting exactly the same thing will happen in biology if some attempt is made to regulate dna synthesis but i think the same thing would happen because dna synthesis is a technology the dna you make with dna synthesis has some value not very large dna is everywhere in our world not expensive but the products that you hope to make using that dna much more valuable many billions of dollars where the dna itself thousands of dollars at this point in so if you attempt to restrict access to the inexpensive thing easy to make i suspect going to happen is there will be a broadly distributed black market very hard to see into all i wanted to thank amy thank you very much dr carlson we have ample time now for i ask both the commission member and the public to keep questions any comments preceding questions brief so we can give ourselves to hear more and probe our three presenters i will actually turn to vice chair for the first jim i appreciate the given the structure that we imagined and the flow of the commission know when again we will have an opportunity to have an of scientists folks who are as knowledgeable as you like to several questions but start with a naive question about dr bassler you spoke about differentiating between engineering and synthetic biology largely as a matter of scale wonder also and again a very naive question focusing on synthetic biology as our ability to synthesize sequences base pair sequences but we spoken about the need or maybe there is no need or the possibility that synthetic might ultimately address some of the machinery that you have about the protoplasmic chassis that would be operated by the software is synthetic biology do we anticipate it going in direction or is it strictly focused on the bonnie well i think that there are sort of a few kinds of synthetic i think people like talking around this paper that really interested in being able to make bigger pieces of dna pieces of dna means more genes that we can put together hopefully logical i think there is a second kind of synthetic biology that likes engineers who like to think about as drew said or dr carlson cars work right so they would like to take genes with functions if these could be modular each function could you put together and make some new contraption or a better contraption already and i think the third kind of synthetic biologist that actually been talked about today are people who are trying to think about did life actually arise on earth i think jack szotstak phd is best example of this their approach is orthogonal they take littlest bits they can not nitrogen and carbons but lipids nucleotides and try to get them to to understand that could have so i think all three of those things are in our future i think three of those things will be working together if we can make pieces of dna then the gizmo guys can string more genes together hopefully make more interesting i will finish by saying that the premise of all of this is that we to know what those genes do these are not just a t g and put together evolution did that for us biologists have provided knowledge about some of these functions and that is a real part synthetic biology if you want to go beyond just making longer amy great i open it up nita thank you for these presentations they were terrifically amy i ask everybody to project into the mics because i think people in back of the room would appreciate hearing as clearly as we around table can so project out get close bring the mic nita going to project a little bit more thank you i just started saying thank you for these presentations in case you hear i want to jump to some of the recommendations that each of you made both in your published work and here today about so dr carlson you suggest that methamphetamines might be a analogy and dr endy i know you have been quoted and suggest perhaps regulation would be difficult and it would create more toward other countries or other resources but i wonder if you thinking of a particular model of regulation like methamphetamine restricting access rather than something like licensing or wondering with something like biobricks is there some sort registration requirement for to track what they doing and more like gun licensing laws to know where different products were going and to be able to know what the outcome of these things would amy drew do you want to drew i think if you can bring forward a conversation about regulation immediate question becomes to what end or to what challenge is being focused and and so it could be in the case of something like the biobricks international genetically engineered machines igem and competition like rob mentioned where we have genetically machines an olympics around the world the regulation would be safety are these students in their work in schools and high schools and schools and colleges being safe are they being and keeping the public safe and the environment safe to the best know what we have done at igem as synthetic biology has grown out of engineering is to leverage and take advantage of the past successes in that area for example the recombinant dna committee rac and the office of biotechnology assessment at the oba here in the united states both provide biosafety guidelines the engineering of genetic material the igem teams in order participate in the competition and be judged have to answer questions with their submission do you have a biosafety committee your institution yes or no what do they think of your project yes do you have any safety concerns about your project are any of biobrick parts you are contributing back to share with the do they have safety concerns with what we see by this mechanism is we are practically promulgating practices as they exist around the topic of biosafety where we into puzzles on this one particular topic of governance is when technology platforms begin to move beyond an institutional framework so we have igem teams right now although there some who would like to participate coming from outside universities community colleges or even a high school on a if you think about a future where you go from information to your genetic engineering design suite can be a phone on a school where you can move the information around and email the so what are the challenges in biosafety governance keep remarks limited to that for going to be to figure out how to deal with an increased scope genetic engineering work an increased pace of the work where it not be the case that every new design can go through the exact deep review and dealt with practically already at levels but we now need to figure out how to promulgate that or disallow outright such work beyond you know relatively institutional bounds that can afford to have an established biosafety nita can i have a to this interested in the that all of you reference in your work and i know that with the competition they are excluded from the competition wondering if biobricks would actually sell directly to individual who wished to purchase to construct in their garage and one of the small organization inventors that dr carlson refers to synthetic biology and if so given that igem excludes them what of biosafety concerns should we have about the there any way to track what they are purchasing and what the and development course would be from those drew i think a good question that brings up two dimensions governance one is biosafety and second is property in the same way that very enthusiastic about the technology synthetic genomics but heard concern about its equally enthusiastic about individuals who are compelled to and learn about biology and to tinker with it for useful purposes the i think unfortunate that represented with that label to honest i would prefer it to be represented with a if you look at the success of igem for example very specifically team that won last year from the university of cambridge in implemented seven biosynthetic pathways in different strains of to make a rainbow of colors they called this is a feat of genetic engineering that makes jay for million seem really great but now they can do it for how did they succeed they did it together half of the genetic that went into the project came from the collection they got that for free the gene synthesis company in menlo park gave them free gene synthesis because its president is a of the university and dupont gave the students free access to specially strain of ecoli that overproduced the precursor so the successes in synthetic biology at the level of young people not they are i think it diy is an unfortunate misrepresentation what we have work through in terms of the biosafety is can we expand beyond institutional biosafety framework boundaries can we take an from amateur radio for example and establish a process many exciting things to a second challenge then to say this very briefly comes back property rights the biobricks foundation is a public organization it own the biobrick parts we freedom to operate on the uses of the genetic components in new biobrick parts came into the competition contributions from over the world if we wanted to be upstanding citizens in the world property rights have to try and get claims on those and within the not for or against patents per se but in this context doing for uses of genetic functions would cost about per which adds up to million the budget for this student educational event distributed worldwide is million so the and pace of work in the technology is in this case outstripped created not a governance challenge but i think an ownership and innovation amy thank you yes raju great presentations thank can you compare and contrast what is happening technically in biology to what happened in recombinant dna technology in the some people argue this is no different and there is absolutely new in synthetic biology than what we have been doing for the last or amy bonnie you want to bonnie yeah i think the difference is slight i think there is dna right and then there is the stringing together of known functions it is genetic we have been doing this biologists for years right we call i think that the fundamental difference is that biologists typically think about optimization of the process like can you this to work if it works in a petri dish but if you really want to make products you medicines vaccines we have to take this engineering view where think about you know how to get these components to work together how to get these to work reliably in a large scale you what actual parts do we need and what can you do away with this how engineers think about building so i really do believe that the difference is the perspective optimization and scale that traditional biologists amy let me just follow up on jim see if the others amy and going to open it to the others as well if you would answer question about the past and also project forward part of our charge is to think about answers to this question as one reporter asked me is the cat already out of the box before things happen that we prepared so how different is what synthetic biology is doing now and different is it likely to be moving and this is a question what do you anticipate likely the developments here moving rob you want to rob gee so first i mostly agree with what dr bassler said i think that effort to bring engineering practices in is new and brings power attempt to actually go instead of to a science paper to a that has revenue is an important step and it clear to me you get there without the engineering component and i know going to be totally we should be clear that igem is kind of an experiment and the agenda that came out of mit the ability to snap these parts like legos and a lot in there good and a lot like unclear that you can qualify these parts carefully enough to them in this way actually not very good at measuring most of components that we want to use well enough to use them in the way like to use and what do i think is coming boy i think the cat was out of the bag decades ago i think it is too i think anything we can do about this at this point time to go back to the previous question or two questions amy you are very consistent rob the issue is could you possibly limit access is it possible proscribe these technologies in any way i see a ability to limit access to the technology so one kind regulation that i think is off the table amy what about knowing happening we are a public deliberative in part because we as a nation are committed to actually things out in the open except when privacy concerns arise a important exception but not really relevant so what about access to rob so i think our only tool in fact i think that trying to track of what people are doing trying to have people volunteer and it together speaking for myself my own company started in my garage it was garage biology company and is really really hard it would have been easier had i had the resources of a or a larger company and we are probably going to succeed but saying we are going to with a particular nonetheless i think any way you could have stopped from doing what i wanted to do in my garage nothing no regulation covering what i was up to and i was very careful to only do things that i was sure were without amy and here to prove rob here the fbi did not come and so going forward if you are worried about threats if you worried about mistakes i think the only way we can deal with issue is to try to make sure everyone is open about what they are and one way to help enforce that is to not enforce it but to to set up some sort of framework where people can ask so every day if you are in the lab you stumble over something work you stumble over some bit of a recipe from some or kit that work the way supposed to you want to someone about that we should help people ask that question in part make sure that they putting it to some use that is years ago it happen to me so much these days years ago used to receive interesting emails from people saying what do think if i do this what should i do about that most of the time would say well not such a big deal you can try that i think going to work every once in a while i get an email says i want to play with this immune system gene and this gene and i say really a bad idea please do and we want that to be common right we want those kinds of to come up so that some kind of the best i think we can amy thank drew agree technically scientifically that synthetic represents an outgrowth of genetic engineering but i would equally not more strongly urge you to recognize that changes in process and scope can lead to very significant so for example when carper mead and lynn conway backed off on on design on the computer chip in the early s if you their rules the chips be as powerful because they used silicon but all have regular layouts what this led to was could get your designs fabricated on any different available wafer manufacturing facility because it matter if the lined up exactly right and the significance of that one difference was that now all of a sudden many people students could design what became micro processors and have researchers that had bad internal policies could outsource through external service getting access to their own fab lines first igem class before igem existed all we wanted to do was our students out of the lab we wanted them to spend a month designing dna based on everything we knew from the biology that biologists gave to us at the end of the month going to ship dna over the internet to a company the company will print the dna students get it back and they try it nothing worked that year except we learned how to decouple the of genetic material from its fabrication and so that means biological engineering student who is a sophomore today in a course has a very different experience and just last spring they quite literally designing new genes sending them to a company and getting it back and testing it out in a couple of you index the capacity to the genome scale and it makes a difference you combine that with component libraries that broken meaning they sometimes sort of work which is better nothing which is where we are and all of a sudden new please underestimate the consequences of changes in process if the technology is an incremental development amy thank dan this will be a question again about the future of the field somewhere in this pile of things i read maybe it was one of you said it engineers abhor complexity maybe one of the two of you somebody else but it seems to me that what we heard from bassler is that the are very complex interactions gene chromatin interactions gene membrane as far as the future of the field wondering whether there from an engineering perspective advantages of pursuing the which would lead you in the direction of eukaryocites organisms versus the engineering perspective that pushes utililty keeping to smaller simple organisms that can products which would be very useful to is there a push or a pull in one direction towards the simplicity towards the drew quick answer engineers are not always devoted to a model system as a geneticist biologist might be they like to solve problems or opportunities and so you know professor ron weiss in the engineering department at mit would be someone who moved engineering in bacteria to yeast and now stem cells and his in engineering biological systems in mammalian cells has to do implementing a synthetic program that would inside a detect levels of insulin and sugar and coordinate the production insulin within a living body and provide a living therapy for so i think it would be wise to expect that although are the most amazing things and i agree with everything bassler is saying the engineering community is unlikely to stay there and in terms of complexity what you see in synthetic biology from naive perspective is we are scrambling we are trying look at the history of technological development and engineering distill anything to the challenge of how do we get better engineering i could talk about telegraph technology in britain in the s roman aqueducts and from the end of past experiences we find interesting to us as engineers one hallmark of biology is complexity and it would be a mistake of the highest order to that as we go into this challenge of getting better at biology we will not learn tremendous new engineering from the my hope is that as engineers biology will teach us how to better with complexity how to better integrate artificial systems with a richer environment in a way that leads to increased flourishing and sustainable civilization where that all plays out and when it out you know we predict but it seems like a very amy since we have this great opportunity for the conversation engineer and biology bonnie you want to give the bonnie i want to be clear complexity is the goal and i mean to that the engineers want to avoid that they would love biologists we would love to understand complexity what we to do but we you know we get genes for million bucks to work together where we are so i think the focus and the goal would be to move this to more more and more complicated organisms but just the way biology happened in the last years we start with bacteria because they simpler right they have fewer bits fewer wires right but truth is at least currently is that even with our best bacteria you know we do it yet so what we find right now overwhelming beautiful complexity of these organisms is humbling hubris to think you can do this in a human i think the focus on bacteria very often we learn the principles learn the rules from studying these bacterial systems and then we to apply that to ever more complicated organisms but we need to clear we even understand ecoli yet so that i think is a bigger sort of hurdle than our ability to make dna to clone that we yet put complicated systems by any means together with parts that we think we understand deeply but the need jobs you the beauty of it too right that there and there in the amy barbara i wanted to put together a couple of your previous comments and ask a real specific question about the commission and if this is really strategic priority for our country synthetic biology and i want talk about the value side of what recommendations could this commission make that might support that value where do you think the areas are that we need most help and i have to say that i was caught by your freedom of writing if you will if one of the areas specifically might need a recommendation or are there other areas that you rob all right give it a so as drew noted very little public funding of gene technologies all of that is in the private sector for the most a very different story in dna sequencing so that has been benefit of substantial government support prizes awards contracts for purchasing instruments what and actually very similar to the way integrated circuits so intel was able to fund its fabrication facilities in large because it had contracts to sell chips to the us government for variety of purposes as has happened in dna but in my conversations with people in the gene synthesis industry us government funds at most of their activities by purchases professors who have grants who buy genes or occasionally the or some organization funded by the nih will have a bunch of essentially written from scratch by dna synthesis to see how they but other than that not a lot of support there is little drew correct me if wrong on the engineering side of things or ability to actually build dna circuits with defined function there some support from the nsf maybe some support from the nih but so great unclear how much work in industry can be said to supporting that kind of activity as opposed to just trying to something to work to put on the market as soon as i think that one of the benefits of the us government investment better understanding how to build biological systems that have functions is that it will help us sort out the inevitable mistakes come out of the commercial world so one of first products i forget which one it was in the late s they tested the field many years and it looked to be okay then a couple of after it was released to farmers in some fraction of the plants cotton balls fell off i think of the the new york times reported on that for a couple of months and there was no longer reporting it appears what happened was some of agreement was signed and farmers received payments and nobody explored at least publicly what went wrong that crop that had made it through the regulatory process and had and i think it would be nice if we had some that we have now that same capability would help us pandemics and help us build better amy thank anita thank you i had three questions and in some form or another three have been i had a question about regulation and pointed out not regulation is prohibition and might have to look at licensing registration or even what kind of adjudicatory role government play in the the other is cloning versus creation i guess i kind of want to there a little bit with you because on the one hand i think you quite right a strong sense in which dr research more sort of a cloning than a creation kind of research yet as if the public is as comfortable as biologists are with the of cloning so i want you to say a little bit about why if research that dr venter has come out with is more like cloning than creation why we be worried about that because as we know some kinds of cloning still invoke a kind anxiety in the mind of the public why is this sort of a continuation of benign and the third question is about the public investment issue i struck by both of the comments from engineers about how public investment in synthetic biology and yet i remember in the the government putting lots and lots of money into dna sequencing mapping and that was a huge public investment but without investment a lot of happening in the synthetic biology be those are my bonnie so i agree with you that cloning is a hot word and i think unfortunately i think the cloning that the public is most about is what we would call human reproductive cloning but synonymously with what molecular biologists have done for almost years which is to move genes around in bacteria to cut and put of dna this paper is about molecular biology and cloning in the context what we have done since the discovery of dna almost it making i think what the public fears is that going to make this organism person right from scratch and that we have no ability do these were genes that evolution worked on for billions of years me this finding would be like if shakespeare writes this perfect and i put the play on the xerox machine and then get hamlet i think that the xerox machine wrote hamlet right so what it is traditional cloning in the sense of what molecular have done except a lot bigger piece of dna and that is important for our future and our ability to synthesize useful at industrial skill we have to be able to make bigger and pieces of dna in order to make more interesting and i think the problem is that the public misunderstands what the cloning means when it has this very negative connotation that has to with i think human biology and stem cells and not what this anita could you reframe your wonderful point about creation and cloning without using the word bonnie a dna synthesis on a machine of a known anita it works for i have a question of the funding and so forth can we be more about the role of government it has been a huge government in the foundations of genetic and genomic drew yeah thank you very much let me try and be so absolutely everything happening depends on the successes the genome projects the successes of molecular biology genetics can acknowledge warren weaver and the rockefeller foundation mendel before him and the patronage of the scientists in the century and so let me turn it to synthetic biology very specifically and use example of dna so without naming the federal agency in there was the public funding for an advanced dna synthesis program in place the of this program was to be able to construct base pairs synthetic dna in hours the purpose of the program was to rapid response vaccination which i sure hear about later morning the program was shut down the reason why gets us back to question and perhaps a comment from you about the role the the program was shut down because it was put through the post drill the washington post asked what is the worst case associated with this public investment and the program answered honestly not content to synthesize polio virus in our agency can do it in hours and leadership of that agency not in the political position to defend that and the reason in a political position to defend that is that they had framing no public framing from an ethics perspective from government perspective from a safety perspective or from a perspective or you name it that would give them comfort that okay to explore developing tools that will make the engineering biology easier without putting their careers on the i think if you were to look throughout the federal funding agencies see many agencies that are chomping at the bit to try and figure how to provide significant public support for this important area they are hampered by the fact that not been an okay to say have to explore we have to i think this commission which i recognize as being the public venue for considering this has a very role to play because it makes it okay to talk about this it makes okay to try and make the next step because you know going have a place to work it out and discuss and learn so i really do you both for the in closing i should also acknowledge that we do have very essential modest and sustained support from national foundation and from the national institutes of health but funding amounts are in small numbers of millions of dollars which is lot of taxpayer money but not compared to the genome projects and is more reflective of a very scrappy very innovative research amy thank you nelson let me move back to the first question that nita asked limitations on the technology and perhaps go to someone with my someone who cloned his first pieces of dna when i was an undergrad and now i struggle with a virus that can change every base of kb genome in one day in one patient i have always been humbled the way natural selection that frankly can sweep aside every thing think we can intelligently do in the laboratory because of way that mother nature has done things for billions of i was struck by some of your comments in that sense by the arguments that you have made and i was wondering if the three of could briefly expand on what you think might be the ultimate on this technology which is just the fact that so ham fisted being able to do amy one of you can take it and then going to go to the public bonnie right i think that nature is and i think that the of beauty of this commission and the problem is the beginning this field and our knowledge and understanding is so limited but is how all scientific fields have started by this people you know scientists and engineers so about how things work we do these little bits we hope we something that makes you know years from now we can do it a bit and i think that the future that the public is really worried about really far in the future that does not mean you guys should not trying to manage or think about that but i think that the reality what we are able to do in the lab as opposed to the publicity of we are able to do in the lab are strikingly and so i think of course this is how science happens right so think totally a wonderful and and an field to have the engineers helping the biologists to learn and the biologists giving the engineers fodder to work with i think least right now what you said we are bad at it because we understand complexity but amy drew very quickly regarding does the fact that these are highly evolved systems how does that limit what our capacity to deliver know i have any experience engineering machines replicate in engineers really do for approximation all our we make are disposable artifacts the thing then to say about that you know a lesson from francis arnold at cal tech and evolution becomes an editor a partner with us not fighting against and it becomes as i suspect hear today from some of the leaders in the field you know thinking how to take forward engineering and synthesis and every other idea us naive of biology have and couple that to power of evolution to make more complicated systems incredible amy going to oh yes rob why you chime and then going to ask if anybody would like to ask a rob the thing i would add to that is that it took about years to from octave chanute sort of falling off a hill in berlin to the which was the first airplane designed and built entirely on computer using the pioneers of flight try to build geese and today we build a goose we have no idea really how a goose can manage do what it does the aerodynamics involved are extremely complex energy management is extremely complex and all we can do is take step at a time and see how far we get and in that same frame i think all of this has to go complexity out there we seen and acknowledge that nature can do marvelous things and we to accomplish a very small fraction are be able to emulate a fraction of that beautiful amy thank yes would you introduce yourself and then ask your robert yes i am dr robert donahue with the national institutes of and my question is to dr i would be interested in your comments dealing with it seems synthetic biology is heading towards bacteria and you are the on intercommunication between bacteria what impact is this going have on that amy thank you very much a model question i would bonnie try to give a model answer so i think synthetic biology focused on bacteria now because they are simple right so i the beginning and what this gentleman is asking is we know bacteria work in groups they communicate with each other chemicals and that allows them to carry out collective behaviors our simplest organisms have group a paper in where synthetic biologists have put together communication circuit and got groups of cells to do things that tried to mimic what natural cells do so i think that again the next step in being able to take one cell and a synthetic circuit in it now we can do it in groups of cells and them to act coordinately i think a beautiful and extension of synthetic amy thank you steve my name is steve mcgill a student at the university of pennsylvania was wondering i guess what the current state of the property environment is there for these genes these parts and what you think it should be going forward with synthetic biology thank amy thank drew you are asking about the property right situation on the uses genetic so for example columbia university from marty work the patent on green fluorescent dna a separate equally if not more important around the tools of synthetic and the property rights around doing in terms of the uses around the component libraries you know you find available analysis for how many patents have been filed uses of genetic functions in the united states in europe and japan how that sort of tapers off throughout the operating practically right now in what the lawyers recommend me describe as legal limbo in that we sort of have operational research exemption at universities in the united better in switzerland and better in other so that allows what randy redburg the director of igem calls a and get system to work for students and organizations it then creates boundaries beyond research organizations so if a like genencor would like to use biobricks clearing to work around component libraries is a mess we really do need to grow up and out who to scale and define best available practice around freedom to operate and perhaps consider the development of a right that is better optimized to the future of biotechnology have the capital costs and latencies as we see present in patent amy the question the uncertainty is probably the worst situation to be rob would you like to address rob speaking from experience in the academic and commercial world pretty unhappy with the way patents are being applied to simply because so complicated so expensive it makes it to do specifically from the commercial perspective one of our projects you look into the costs we put into developing the actual molecules the costs we put into getting a patent the patent costs are running about times the capital costs of the actual project and those costs are fees so the transaction costs for us to to secure some sort of property right as called are they totally outweigh what we spend on the actual project and that represents a barrier to innovation and i know you guys going to fix that but you could at least recommend that you think about other ways to secure property right for dna constitution enables congress to spin up that kind of thing and we have right now are trademarks patents copyrights what not can patent dna but you copyright dna and it would be examining whether extending copyright to cover dna or creating other kind of property right to cover dna would be a useful thing amy thank you david my name is david clayman a current student at the university pennsylvania like to ask what role private industry or may play in providing a robust error checking mechanism for perhaps bioenthusiasts prior to the introduction of tools at such cheap that problems may rob do you have specific david i think to the analogy of the software development community developed very robust algorithms for error checking and error prior to the facilitation of the distribution of software tools of great power and flexibility and ease that amateurs could rob great thank you i think the private industry has some initial quite significant around trying to coordinate the screening sequence going into gene synthesis processes not the solution all the biosecurity problems but the example where with the technology allows you to get a little bit ahead of the now if you want to search for examples from other developments the moses facility that powered the micro revolution in part is a wonderful thing to think about this is facility that coordinates access to silicon wafer fabrication defines the standards of defining chips and placing orders it places the orders that come in from a very diverse set of including individuals gets the chips built and redistributes and so if a combination of public and private partnership basically could provide this sort of node you might able to complement what individuals can do with the strengthening community and governance and best practices through clearing basically that provide access to the technologies in a way advises them be used for overwhelming constructive amy i am aware of the clock and we are in danger of running over we another very important session but before we close going take a minute break reconvene in minutes i just want on of all of us on the commission to thank drew bonnie and rob for truly great audience meeting

theodoulou with celebrity stylist gok wan during to me the secret millions has been a total joy from day one i fortunate to be involved with the project right from the start and bowled over by the number and the quality of the applicants we had interview so that we could arrive at the final fivehaving just the final programme i think we made the right choices and that dealt with each issue each episode with sensitivity and honesty produced good television in the to us at the big lottery fund this was about more than good tv project was important for three main firstly the issues to be addressed where chosen by the public it important to us that we encourage public involvement in our work all the national lottery belongs to the secondly this was a great opportunity for us to show the public a little bit of what the big lottery fund does how we use money and what sort of projects we support on a personal note it also an opportunity to demonstrate the importance of taking the calculated risk with some proposals for if we do not take some we will never change finally we value every chance to highlight key social issues increase awareness of some of the challenges we face as a society if we can do this in a way that helps those community organisations work hard to make a difference by giving them exposure then it is the feedback i have received after each programme has been and watching these programmes has made me feel very proud of the that the big lottery fund does and more importantly i know everyone who works for the organisation and all those who have projects funded by big have shared in this if you missed the secret millions on channel then try and catch it od worth the leave a from me the april tags big big lottery fund community national lottery philanthrophy third sector welsh by robert roffe senior policy learning manager for the big fund in robert robert raising funds in the current financial climate is a challenge for third sector organisations in wales they are heavily reliant on bodies like the welsh government and local authorities to give funds usually in the form of grants but as austerity bites funds are starting to dry the difficulty is that there are very few alternatives for organisations to turn to wales have the same culture as places like london we have many big companies wealthy donors to set up trusts and foundations this is why big taking an interest in philanthropy and we want to help create a culture of philanthropy in as a first step awarded a grant to the community in wales the community foundation in wales promotes the of philanthropy in wales by creating and managing relationships donors and those who are running local initiatives they work strengthen local communities by providing a permanent source funding building endowment and funds to link to local needs awarded them up to to endow a trust will form part of their for but there is a catch we only pay into the fund for wales what cfiw can match from donations by doing this we hope to incentivise new donations making money go we plan on stopping here over time we want to try to with welsh businesses and encourage them to dip into their this is not without its own challenges as most of the welsh sector is made up of small businesses with relatively modest going to explore using a approach mechanisms that allow small businesses to make donations to a fund or wales also needs to benefit more from the existing trusts foundations there are surprisingly few applications to uk trusts wales and this needs to be addressed working with these funders we will explore and respond to the reasons for this application rate and will consider developing partnerships and funding arrangements to lever in their finally we want to try to connect donors to small community groups do not normally benefit from donations or have the expertise of the larger charities we are looking at how we can these groups to develop fundraising capacity and make better links donors by publicising their work we are particularly interested innovations in giving here exploiting modern technology and internet as potential portals between charities and the challenge is huge and whilst we can only hope to scratch surface we can at least act as a catalyst for philanthropic action inform the ongoing debate on third sector funding

is helping prevent and tackle issues around wales director john wales director john having worked for the big lottery fund big for nearly a seen firsthand through some of the great projects we support homelessness can happen to anyone and how story common knowledge that homelessness has been on the rise in since with experts identifying the poor economic climate and undersupply of affordable homes as part of the problem and with sign of the economic downturn loosening its grip we realise during these hard economic times that projects which provide for the homeless or tackle the root causes of homelessness need help more than why good to hear that since the first national balls were rolled out in big has awarded nearly million over worthy projects in wales which either provide advice support or aim to prevent homelessness but not about how money we give out about the positive difference the money award is having on the lives of people in communities most in whether a small grant of for st church pontypridd to hold regular film evenings for homeless people or a grant of over half a million pounds for digartref ynys provide specialist accommodation and housing support for homeless people on anglesey i know that the projects we fund are making truly remarkable difference to the lives of those who need and recent figures released by one of our funded shelter cymru highlights exactly how their support is making positive impact the proportion of households who come to shelter faced with mortgage repossessions has trebled in the past four and the number of people in wales claiming help from councils homelessness has also gone up for the second year running last shelter cymru dealt with nearly housing problems in wales prevented homelessness in of those cases this is an example of excellent work already being carried out by some of the we fund throughout and by adding value to the support and advice provided by our and other statutory and voluntary
