interview alves da jul one of the best character creators in the business and member of thu advisory board shares his thoughts about his career techniques even bowling tips read httpaddr httpaddr guest artist interview alves da jul one of the best character creators in the business and member of thu advisory board shares his thoughts about his career techniques even bowling alves da silva is a passionate artist why he decided leave the comfort and security of company that he helped to create years beforeand dedicate himself to character creation as freelancer a bold decision but one that paid off giving the cg an accomplished artist with several awards and praise from all major websites and could also have been a great pro bowler if it for a injury the sport might have lost a good bowler but gained amazing when did you get your start in the i began my work in d architectural visualization back in when created my own company pura imagem with friends however i started my work as a freelance character artist in after my of can you pinpoint the exact moment when you decided to architectural visualization behind and dedicate your career character creation that had to be a tough it was a tough decision because i chose to leave the company which had created from the start and worked in for years also i was married and with little children but professional success and fulfillment are not the same thing being at the top meant that i no longer doing what i loved my days were passed dealing with and using excel i found myself working in personal pieces at night weekends to fulfill my creative needs and compensate for the dryness my in i decided to participate in xxiv challenge any aspirations and surprisingly won the first prize for me that an indication that i could survive from doing what i loved a months later after much thought and huge support from my family took the leap one day i was a company owner the next i was freelancer best decision of my can you run us through your process when creating a i usually start with research to get familiar with the subject will provide inspiration and help to avoid pitfalls like adding a on a male kangaroo like i then i sketch the character trying to establish a good foundation i try not to define it too i like to leave some space for further concept development during d sculpting moving to zbrush i establish the final proportions and block the concept after approval of the d concept i refine and detail depending on the type of work i can retopologize it or not then will create uvs and textures and finalize the character by creating materials and as a portuguese artist sure you had to overcome a lot obstacles that artists from countries with other visibility to deal with tell us about that i only manage to work as a character artist without leaving my due to the development in technology and internet speed back in it possible to work remotely i am quite sure that if i lived the united states i would have tried to embrace character creation lot earlier and would have tried to work at one of the major apart from that i think that the playing ground is leveled at time the internet speed makes it as easy to work with someone another city as to work with someone on the other side of the companies also take advantage of this and search for top talent the world to work on their today artists compete with talent from the whole planet location is the least of an problems these although made some more realistic models most of your work to be more cartoony how would you define your absolute photorealism is not my favorite dish i like doing it time to time because i learn a lot from it learning real anatomy physical properties of materials and light provide to bend in non realistic some of my characters especially humans tend to because i like the form to reveal personality beyond real world physical limitations this leads caricatural i also love stylization and the ability to reduce form to its significant in some characters i try to explore searching for the most significant geometric features and them resulting in a more sculptural one of the with serge birault of fury the festival official mascot guides us through the creation of fury concept to final i am a big fan of work and it was the first time i had opportunity to work with one of his concepts serge was very because he adapted his style to fit mine he created a unicorn some very lines that translated beautifully into we had some fun launching a few ideas getting inspiration from and mrt serge made a sketch with an idea for the overall with a flag and a pile of bones helmets and weapons and a dark serge gave me total freedom letting me introduce my own ideas were some hard challenges on the image like displaying a dark against a dark background or dealing with horse fur which is the d creation sequence started with a zbrush sculpt of a neutral followed by retopology then the character was posed and it was then exported to dsmax in which i applied fur with hairfarm rendered with the character was going to be used in the thu challenge in people have to create a friend or opponent to fury so i tended to the character a bit more powerful and bellicose to stand against opponents however i guess it might have lost a bit of it was a great opportunity and i am thankful for how did you get involved with the thu i guess i was one of the first people to hear about the festival day luis from the thu team invited me for lunch and describing his idea of creating a vfx and animation festival portugal it sounded like a huge project and a big dream but one i have learned in the past is that is tenacious as hell and can make impossible things so i told him that i would be willing to participate and help in way i could an event about my passion in my country how could i be willing to having followed the project from the very beginning it is amazing the organization has managed to achieve i think this is going to what kind of experience do you think get from the thu as well as the the least i can say is that if i been invited as a speaker would have bought a ticket the speakers lineup is so great i will attending as much talks as i also there are many that i have met online and which will have the chance to meet personally it will be a great time learning networking and in which project do you think learned the most what was most challenging honestly i think that i learn a lot from every project and can pinpoint one in particular in personal work i always try to a new aspect or technique that i had never used before this allows to tackle the difficulties and learning before using them in le rabbit is probably the most painful one because i was hair at the time and it took me about weeks to complete the fur now it can be done in a couple of best piece of advice for a young artist starting a first learn the art then learn the tools build your art foundation learning what was important to artists years ago like theory values composition anatomy etc software changes couple of years but art knowledge will be your life time what piece of work are you most proud if i have to isolate one it has to be mouse love because it the moment in which my career and life if you could change places with another artist in the industry would that i would love to be loic zimmermann for a few days i would like to how it feels to be great at painting d and photography at the time and having a rock star look i will be lucky to meet him at festival a big bowling fan the secret to a perfect i loved bowling but unfortunately a wrist injury took me away competition been a while since i have you have to hit the right side of the first pin in order for the to deflect to the middle of the rack and take the rest of the pins in a domino effect bowling is about adapting to the lane conditions and consistence on the delivery there is a lot more to than can see as most of the game has to do with solving oil pattern and understanding its change over time as oil invisible you have to read the ball reaction in order to read the is there a character either from comics movies or other medium you just wished made it yourself on the other hand which character do you want to tackle some there are many characters love to have participated in fredricksen and russell from up pixar the furious five from kung panda dreamworks melman from madagascar dreamworks sid from age blue sky and many many a character that has never been translated to d i would love to shere khan the tiger from jungle the latest character i have seen that surprised me the goblin quantic the dark sorcerer ps tech favourite disney animated movie of all jungle book a delight to the eyes at a time in which the nine men were the core of the studios thinking that it was possible achieve such a level of movement quality weight and character with sequence of pencil drawings is just

french vfx wizard about his career and passion for a true wizard of the vfx industry alexis wajsbrot currently cg supervisor at framestore has been working on some of the blockbusters from recent years like iron man prince of persia potter the half blood prince and order of the phoenix as well as upcoming gravity from alfonso besides providing the magic on other movies alexis is the of the cult short movie red baloon and is working on his first feature film he will be at the thu festival september to share some of his secrets but you can get to know him little bit better on this guest artist when did you get your start in the i started my career in madrid in in a company named telson mainly on your specialty in vfx is everything fluid like water or what draw you to that i actually started my carreer as a generalist td doing everything modelling animation to render when i moved to macguff in paris were looking for someone who knew how to use realflow for chocolate commercial i always been very interesting by testing different solver and new tools i also study in a school named art technologie de in paris where we have been taught to have artistic and technical background programming mathematics so i a bit of experience in real flow and said that i could help then been hired by moving picture company to do some water on harry potter using a very innovating solver named flowline i ended up doing only related work for the next in my opinion it is one of the most interesting discipline of the as you are always at the limit of the technology always trying to a new solution to create an effect that has never been seen before you can end up doing some modelling animation render as well compositing work in order to create a particular effect a open there seems to be a very technical aspect to it when does the art to give way to science and math or do you think those lines completely blurred during a those lines are very different from project to project but we try to start with what a physically correct simulation would do as real normally easier to get an approval from the client then depending on the brief we are adding a level of magic and control into the simulation on projects like harry potter the magic component is the main one and on a project like gravity physically correct is the most important one then on iron man challenge was to find the right balance between the your short film red balloon won several awards can you tell us about this since i was a child i was passionate about cinema and telling so i always wanted to direct my own movie years ago during todd post production a tim burton horror musical movie i met mace a concept artist and we decided to direct red balloon has been a great adventure i learned a lot on how to a movie from scriptwriting to final grading and distribution it us more than years to finish it as it was a side project to our job red balloon got released years ago and we got lucky enough being selected to over festivals around the world and won awards met lots of talented artist we put the movie online ago and the movie had a lot of success with over millions view youtube vimeo thanks to red balloon damien and i signed with manager and agent in la and we are currently in the our first feature it was made with short budget do you think that the available today and the internet as a way to promote new projects help starting artists to became less dependent of production or big yes we made red balloon with gbp and at the time dslr were that famous so we shoot the movie using red cam but i think now even easier to make very high quality cheap movies from what we during the distribution of red balloon internet is definitely the way to get feedback and to get some recognition all the contacts are now working with we made them from the vimeo release of balloon internet is the best tool to create a buzz and attraction i agree i feel we can now make a good movie without help of big studios at least what we will try to achieve will let you know if we succeed there are several shots on red balloon that draw a parallel to certain one in david panic room was that i can only say thank you for the parallel david fincher is by far favorite director he has in my opinion the dreamt filmography he also an example for me as he originally comes from a vfx working at ilm during red balloon we were wondering how to use skills in a movie that does not really require vfx i believe fincher succeed in using vfx to better tell a story and use it enough we definitely use panic room as a reference for our damien my co director did actually work at buf the company that panic room how did you get involved with the thu the organization got in contact with me through mccullock framestore vfx framestore worked for over years on projects that are still not released like ronin and of alfonso highly anticipated new movie gravity so was the only cg supervisor who worked on a project iron man that released what kind of experience do you think get from the thu as well as the i am sure i will meet a lot of very talented artists with great i will learn from the conference of my colleagues and spend a time in in which project do you think learned the most what was most challenging learned from every project that been involved in i guess one that i probably learned the most from is the also the one that the most challenging gravity as framestore got involved since the production of the project and we had the chance to work with a director like alfonso cuaron very close to best piece of advice for a young artist starting a be patient be passionate always try to do better that was supervisor is asking if you are not ready to work very hard this is maybe not for you be really open minded and curious about discipline and not only vfx related get very good at one thing get good at one thing that companies be able to let you what piece of work are you most proud i am very proud of the work we did on iron man but i would still the work we did on gravity if you could change places with another artist in the industry would that i must have to come back to david fincher alien seven the fight club social network how can you do best billionaire tony stark or bruce tough question but i am here for iron man tony lord of the rings or a song of ice and fire aka

about his work career personal tastes in an interview where get to know better one the members of the thu advisory board and confirmed speaker of festival this is someone that really want to meet september at trojan horse was a when did you get your start in the my first job in d was years ago say but prior to that i already working for a few magazines as a freelance illustrator when was a can you define the style of work if such a hard to say i try to keep it open and faithful to my vibrant color palette moody what i often hear and it works you went with a unique approach when you decided to get a tattoo also resulted in the fall project care to talk more i like the hitting two birds with one stone concept i went to a tattoo artist to learn about the methodology and quickly realized that there was a connection to be made between this and way we texture things in d back to quantic i had fragments of my scanned i reconstructed a clean mesh and designed the damn tattoo photoshop while testing its placement by moving the uv layout maya at the very end i warped the image using a tattoo inspired and handled it to my tattoo artist in parallel i pushed the render far as i could technically do back then to promote my work as a artist it was an interesting in some of your works you mix d and d techniques what kind advantages do you take from both styles the key to make it something i used to do a lot and that i keep using at recently been mixing everything in my work i love photography now a major component of my illustration process as well as medium of its own d is

defines bespoke as adj a of clothes made to individual order a b making or selling such clothes a bespoke for many of us hearing the world bespoke probably conjures of that elderly gentleman from savile row in london known taking different measurements of your body the longest for being my after fittings he then spends another painstaking months building and crafting the ultimate suit imagine suit made of the highest quality wool that feels as plush as that moves with you with grace in any position and that gives you air of confidence every time you step out of your home yeah never experienced that either but like bespoke tailors are a unique and wonderful experience because you only get exactly what you want but also exactly what you need that extra on your left arm that you never of there is a long process filled with seemingly endless adjustments if anything like me probably gained a few pounds that month but in the end the product is perfectly only in the same way that every body is different so is every tailoring education like a suit is about taking lots measurements coming up with the right approach and then carrying that special plan what a world it could be if every student had his her own bespoke goal is to be exactly that a bespoke tailor of education begin with assessment engine which provides the granular view of what a student knows and know in essence take measurements of a math knowledge down to the millimeter once we are able to ascertain the exact elements that student struggles with we can then create a curriculum specifically for that individual nearly every day our teachers perform miracles upon miracles to provide students with the best education possible but as sizes and the diversity of our student base grow along budget cuts the ability to address every student their individual needs becomes more and more difficult in classroom knowre is built to work with teachers as a tool to help educate and to act as an educational playground for through knowre teachers will be able to automatically assign questions targeted at concepts that each student had difficulty as well as distributing homework for the new material covered that or week as the student proceeds through the curriculum and any questions or problems they will have access to explanations and videos on the specific math concepts needed to that question teachers no longer have to grade homework receive immediate feedback on their assignments and teachers exactly how a student or even an entire class is performing and areas they may be struggling with in short knowre acts as a tool teachers to tailor their curriculum to best teach their at home students can have the same experience by proceeding lessons and receiving their personalized review all while having this allows them to move at their own pace and to either focus getting a little extra help bolster their knowledge possibly for big test or simply move faster than their in this world of

new york ny httpaddr twitter in the by david joo in technology with is your math swiss is your math brain on solid block of cheese we all as students have gaps in our knowledge a singular that we may not have fully grasped or a series of concepts that able to apply in practice the problem this poses is because learning is a compounding activity building upon itself small gap in our knowledge can quickly become a gaping hole as concepts are introduced and expanded upon is it possible to learn to read without knowing the alphabet is it possible to learn how multiply without mastering addition over time these gaps can lead lower scores frustration and may even cause some students to give on advancing further in their studies the challenge that face is how to identify early on and at an extremely granular where these gaps appear and then to develop ways to address them is where knowre comes through our experience as educators running a math academy in south korea we found that the best way to identify these gaps was us to stand over and observe a student solve a problem while doing we were able to say to the student jimmy not using concept correctly it actually works like this and show him how problem should be solved applying this paradigm to every concept and question however would not only be extremely but frankly also not when we only had a few students attending our academy this worked fine however as our academy grew in size our ability provide this personalized attention became increasingly difficult truth that teachers are all too familiar with as a result we to find a product or service to help us after discovering that exist we decided to just build it our goal when we created knowre was to take our proven methodology and simply put it we began by digitalizing individual math concepts which we knowledge units as our service is currently focused on algebra i started with addition subtraction multiplication and division progressed to concepts such as least common multiples factorization and writing linear functions to model examples we then linked these individual concepts with each ultimately creating a network or web of concepts our sounds interesting but what does that have to do with identifying in what our knowledge matrix does is that it allows us to individual math problems in the context of each concept they by breaking down math questions in this way we can ascertain mastery of each component concept that makes up that this allows us to determine why a student got a particular wrong just as if we were helping them solve the problem in look at an example and see how knowre equation in order to solve the above equation a student would need to least common multiplication property of inverse subtraction property of solving the equation using by breaking down this question into its individual components determining the mastery of each knowledge unit we can to identify the gaps in each learning once we have this information we can then create a curriculum tailored to each learning needs eventually filling in the holes the math brain will look more and like a wedge gouda and less like swiss knowre is currently

launched call for proposals horizon horizon boost for european the european commission has for the first time presented calls projects under horizon worth more than eur billion over first two years the funding is intended to help boost economy and tackle issues that will make a in for the first time the commission has indicated funding over two years providing researchers and businesses with certainty than ever before on the direction of eu research policy calls from the budget are already open for submissions as today with more to follow over the course of the year calls in budget alone are worth around billion with funding on the three key pillars of horizon excellent science around eur billion including for grants from the european research council for scientists and eur million for marie fellowships for younger researchers see industrial leadership billion to support industrial leadership in areas like ict nanotechnologies manufacturing robotics biotechnologies and societal challenges billion for innovative addressing horizon seven societal challenges health agriculture maritime and bioeconomy energy climate action environment resource efficiency and raw reflective societies and httpaddr first the horizon work programme sets out the opportunities under the different parts of the programme all are published today on the participant portal each part describes overall objectives the respective calls and the topics within call each topic describes the challenge to be addressed the scope the activities to be carried out and the expected impacts to achieved compared with the seventh framework programme fp are relatively fewer calls and topics the work programme reflects strong approach of horizon allowing applicants have considerable freedom to come up with innovative solutions memo highlights some key aspects of the work focus a number of areas have been identified for special focus in the horizon work programme each of these is embedded in the parts of the work programme and covered by a specific call the focus areas represent around of the total number of calls by the work programme and amount for a total budget of health and care budget eur the cost of healthcare in europe will soon reach per cent of and this figure is likely to go up as population is older and as chronic diseases are on the rise this is where health and focus area comes in by understanding the causes of health and disease and making best use big data we can develop better diagnostics eg in vivo imaging therapies eg clinical trials for diseases health promotion and disease prevention strategies environment and health based interventions at the personal population levels as well as technologies to support healthy eg mhealth funding in this area also aims to breakthrough research and innovation in poverty related and resistant infectious diseases eg vaccine platforms for sustainable food security budget eur ensuring that all people have access to sufficient affordable and nutritious food is a key challenge for our society it has also crucial economic importance in agricultural exports for around of the total value of eu exports and the whole sector employs million people in europe this focus area aims developing competitive and aquatic and food production systems and technologies for a sustainable food as well as promoting safe foods and healthy diets for all understanding the global drivers for food security it is expected efforts in research will help achieve a gain in resource efficiency help reverse a diminishing trend of productivity gains primary production enable food safety policy to be adjusted in the light of new scientific evidence and provide integrated eu approach needed for reducing ill health due to nutrition overweight and obesity for example funding in this will aim at fighting native and alien pests affecting eliminating discards in european fisheries discovering innovative sustainable protein sources of the future and promoting food chains through public growth unlocking the potential of seas and oceans budget the blue growth economy in the eu is expected to grow to people employed by actions in this area will be in line with eu blue growth strategy and relevant eu policies as well provide international cooperation opportunities in particular atlantic ocean research the calls in this area invite for proposals on atlantic observation systems an integrated capacity to oil spills and marine pollution climate change impacts fisheries and aquaculture and ocean security budget eur digital security has many facets including cybercrime online and the protection of fundamental rights digital security in focuses on basic research and also the economic and dimension of security and privacy in the digital ecosystem to ensure eu single market it also helps implement the wider cybersecurity strategy and the digital agenda in horizon will fund research into activities which aim to the security of current applications services and infrastructures support the creation of lead markets and market incentives in cities and communities budget eur two thirds of the eu population lives in urban areas using of energy research carried out under smart cities and communities aim at finding solutions with high market potential in fields such energy efficiency in neighbourhoods providing digital services information for citizens or smart mobility services lighthouse projects will create strong partnerships between academics and cities while empowering citizens to take an active in improving quality of life in cites the projects will and validate attractive business plans that will attract funding allow large scale replication for example eu funding could develop energy districts through better management local resources sustainable refurbishment of residential buildings the application of ict energy budget eur the eu aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by below by with a further reduction to by the aim of competitive energy call is to support this transition tackling the whole innovation process covering a wide range technology readiness levels combining with market uptake and addressing issues standardisation social and humanities impact analysis one of the challenges under this focus area is the integration of energy technologies into the future energy system the partnerships on fuel cells and hydrogen and on the bioeconomy contribute to the objectives of this focus efficiency budget eur about of eu final energy consumption is in buildings and around in industry activities under the energy efficiency focus area deliver energy savings in these two sectors the first calls proposals to carry out research and demonstration of solutions eg building components or heating and cooling systems as well as proposals facilitate policy implementation and skills development and financing for the market uptake of more energy efficient systems and for growth budget eur transport accounts for about of oil consumption and of all emissions research and innovation on equipment and systems vehicles aircraft and vessels will make them smarter more cleaner and quieter while reducing the use of fossil fuels improving air quality one of the main objectives of horizon the field of transport is the deployment of innovative management and information systems advanced traveller efficient logistics and construction and maintenance technologies example the first calls will fund projects aiming at developing technologies for emission vehicles and vessels at urban road congestion as well as improving intelligent a resource to recycle reuse and recover raw materials full compliance with eu waste policy could create an additional jobs within the eu and an extra annual turnover of eur research activities will address the whole production and cycle from waste prevention the design of products and processes recyclability to and waste disposal the calls stakeholders from different sectors with the opportunity to together in new ways citizens will also be involved in developing testing innovative solutions for waste prevention and innovation boosting its value for europe budget eur water is fundamental to human health food security development and the environment it is also an economic sector growing importance for europe with a turnover of some eur billion year making it an invaluable source for growth and jobs actions under this focus area will contribute to the innovation plan of the european innovation partnership on for example activities will include bringing innovative solutions to the market harnessing water research and results for the benefit of industry policy makers and citizens europe and worldwide as well as integrated approaches to management and climate the crisis new ideas strategies and governance structures budget eur actions encompass research on ways to make economic monetary union resilient and sustainable the european growth the social political and cultural consequences of and responses to crisis and other political challenges for europe the focus area foresees research into the future of urban areas and how emerging technologies can be employed in the public safeguarding and securing society including adapting change budget eur the cost of natural and disasters crime and terrorism terms of environmental and impacts amounts on average annual losses of of eu gdp the objective within this challenge to reduce the loss of human life environmental economic and damage from such threats for example funding will be provided projects that use science and innovation for adaptation to change by moving from assessing costs risks and opportunities demonstration of options and european industry is facing many challenges such as competition and the need for energy and resource efficiency in research and innovation is essential to address these and at the same time help develop and deploy solutions to meet societal needs in health energy climate and so key enabling technologies kets are at the heart of a broad range new and future smart applications and products horizon support enabling technologies such as nanotechnologies materials and advanced manufacturing and processing investing in these areas will develop european industrial and secure position in global markets helping competitiveness create jobs and support the calls under this part of horizon will invite proposals are and can bring technologies closer to the for example the nmp call on of production invites proposals that will develop one or more pilot and processes for the of the production of nanopharmaceuticals to the quantities needed for clinical taking into account cutting horizon issues have been mainstreamed in each of different parts of the work programme ensuring a more substantial support will be provided for innovation through such as prototyping testing demonstrating piloting product validation and market replication significant support demand side approaches will be another important feature and public procurement of as well as regulation to foster innovation and will also be the piloting of new forms and sources of including public sector and social innovation as well as pilots private sector services and excellence and widening the existence of internal disparities in research and performance within the eu hinders some member states from meeting full potential low performance is also reflected in the patterns of some member states in framework programmes with factors such as a low level of national investment in research innovation and reduced access to research networks the first will include offers of funding of a total of eur million those member states through measures such as teaming twinning and and communications the information and communications technology ict sector of the eu economy and accounts for of total expenditure in research and development the transformative of ict can also help address many of most pressing challenges in areas such as health the environment and secure and inclusive societies in horizon the eu is investing least more in ict research than in previous research this will support the full range from research to innovation that can deliver revolutionary breakthroughs often on the basis of emerging technologies billion of funding for ict is available through the horizon the ict part of the first horizon work programme focuses on development of a new generation of components and systems micro and and photonics technologies next computing infrastructures technologies and services for the internet content technologies and advanced interfaces and sciences and social sciences and humanities research ssh is fully integrated each of the pillars of horizon and each of the objectives it is a key objective that ssh will contribute to evidence base for policy making at international eu national regional levels in addition ssh is at the heart of the challenge in a changing world inclusive innovative reflective part of the work almost topics in the programmed parts of horizon are to social sciences and humanities this represents around of total topics in the work programme all these are flagged by the designed for searching the work programme estimated budget to related topics over eur million in addition to funding through the erc and the applicants to horizon are encouraged to promote opportunities in the implementation of the action and to ensure balanced participation of women and men at all levels in research innovation teams and in management structures the gender dimension explicitly integrated into several topics across all the sections the work programme for example novel visualisation tools for nanotechnology awareness the human factor in the energy system towards a circular economy through industrial understanding of both needs behaviours and contributes to the scientific quality and societal relevance produced knowledge technologies and innovations it also to the production of goods and services better suited to markets a topic is considered gender relevant when it findings affect individuals or groups of persons these topics flagged to ease access for applicants for example a specific promoting gender equality in research and innovation is included in with and for work programme eur international international cooperation in research and innovation is a priority in horizon the programme is open to the participation researchers from across the world in addition targeted cooperation activities are included across the societal enabling and industrial technologies and other relevant parts of programme for each of these activities the area and partner cooperation are identified upfront in addition organisations who wish to establish an collaboration network with research centres universities or based in outside europe can apply to the marie action research and innovation staff exchange the is to create partnerships between academic institutions companies based in europe and beyond through the exchange of staff a short the eu also reaches out to top talent through research council erc grants which are open to the best of any nationality willing to come to europe erc members can also be of any action and sustainable there is untapped potential for the european economy to be innovative productive and competitive whilst using fewer resources reducing environmental impacts it is expected that at least of overall horizon budget should be related to development and that expenditure should exceed the budget including measures improving resource efficiency the calls foresee for example projects that use co in processes enhance the performance of electric vehicles or make critical infrastructures more resilient against climate extremes in the first calls there are offers of funding for projects improve our understanding of the complex interactions that take between ecosystems better use of earth observation data systems exchanging environmental and climate knowledge with business and society assessing the costs and opportunities of mitigation options in the eu focusing on sustainable access to production of raw materials ensuring resource efficient innovative food production forecasting and anticipating the effects climate change on fisheries and aquaculture promoting innovation to increase energy efficiency in industry and the potential of smes in energy frontier

that will strengthen regional assets focus connect regional supply chains and assist sized enterprises focus and build a and diverse workforce to meet employer demand following is a hypothetical example of how organizations could partner to propose one integrated project concept with distinct scopes of work that the funding agencies could region has established an economic development strategy team comprised of economic development organizations an mep center workforce investment boards wib and american job centers a university or community college and related intermediary organizations to lead the economic development planning efforts a regular basis the team analyzes economic development data and trends to identify industries that hold a comparative advantage for the region or where investment has been increasing as part of this effort the team prepared an asset map and developed a comprehensive regional strategy for growing jobs in key industries the data reveal that the region is continuing to experience growth in the manufacturing sector this validates the thinking because they have successfully encouraged several manufacturers to expand operations locally plus they attracted three manufacturers in the last year strategy team meets to discuss options presented by the make it in america challenge ffo the team reviews their existing asset map and comprehensive regional strategy to assess strengths and weaknesses the team develops a series of specific tasks in the areas of economic development supply chain development and workforce training that best positions the region to attract new investments and expand more manufacturing operations the team strategizes to demonstrate how work in all three of these areas together will grow on the results of their planning efforts the leadership team decides to develop a proposal for funding to support the development and execution of an integrated targeted manufacturing strategy for their region the team has carefully considered the sequence of activities for each of the three project components while the mep center and the wib are ramping up the supply chain and workforce development aspects the infrastructure project will be completed in time and ready for the newly trained workers team outlines three innovative and complementary scopes of work eda applicant the eligible economic development organization decides to focus on updating the existing capacity of infrastructures which is necessary to facilitate the expansion of production capacity of businesses at the industrial park tenants specifically cited lack of water connectivity as a barrier to growth the edo outlines a plan to upgrade these public assets which will benefit the entire manufacturing supply chain nist applicant the mep center decides on two ways to work with current or prospective suppliers for the manufacturer in the targeted industry scouting suppliers in the region to provide market intelligence industry trends and data about the supply chain capabilities and capacity and ability to satisfy requirements of potential new that are considering investing in the region and providing technical assistance to smes ensuring that the suppliers can meet the needs of companies interested in investment and expansion wib applicant is already working in close partnership with the mep center to identify workforce requirements these requirements will be communicated to the local community college to ensure that new entrants and incumbent skills are aligned to the skills demanded by the employer and are up to current industry standards skilled workers ensure that the pipeline of qualified job applicants will support business growth in the region particularly for occupations and industries for which employers are using visas to employ foreign workers see appendix c for more information is this initiative needed overall objective of the challenge is to make it more attractive for businesses to build continue or expand their operations in the united states rather than abroad this national competition up to american communities or regions will become better situated to attract companies to continue operations expand or build in their area resulting in job growth and a stronger economy the challenge will elevate the focus on to one of greater prominence and highlight best practices in promoting job creation and business growth retention and because the make it in america challenge is a coordinated agency effort it will ensure that complementary resources are

funding agencies eda and eta if the team does not request funding from both of these funding agencies the application will be considered and will not be reviewed nist funds available through the make it in america challenge can only be awarded to an existing mep center in good standing as a result all applicants are encouraged to include a nist mep center on their team so that the team is eligible to receive nist funding for projects where an mep center is not reasonably available for example if there is not an mep center located in the nist funds will not be awarded however all applications must propose engagement with appropriate smes and partners to address outreach service delivery and technology commercialization needs of smes see also section ivb of the should dra funding for projects located in the dra service applicants required to submit separate applications to each applicants can apply for eda nist and eta funding at one time through grantsgov applicants must however request funding from each agency and create separate scopes of work for the use of the funds they have requested in order to apply for dra funds applicants must fill out a separate dra application see appendix b of the ffo for more information on how to apply for dra funds an applicant be selected for funding from only one funding agency eg eda but not the others nist and the funding agencies eda nist and eta intend to make their individual awards to the same applicant teams representing approximately projects selected under this competition the one exception will be if projects are located in an area where an mep center is not reasonably available in that case the project team would be unable to apply to nist for funding but could still receive funding from eda and eta in addition dra expects to approve up to three separate awards within the dra region for projects which also leverage funds from the other funding each member of an applicant team need to submit their own sf to all three funding agencies or should the applicant team as a whole submit one sf to all three funding applicant team member should submit an sf to the funding agency or agencies to which they are collectively the applicant team members should be applying for a total funding sources so each of funding agencies should receive an sf from at least one or more are for a single funding the team the one exception to this is if center is not reasonably available to the applicant in that case the applicant cannot apply to nist for funding because only existing nist mep centers are in this instance an applicant not be required to provide an sf to nist the project area be a subset of the region outlined in the comprehensive economic development strategy ceds or alternative eda approved strategic planning applicants have the flexibility to suggest geographies based on demonstrated analysis of quantitative qualitative information about where and how the area targeted for development our applicant team consists of more than one organization which one of us should submit the application package on authorized organizational representative aor for the organization that is applying for eda funds must submit the application package on grantsgov see section vd of the ffo for grantsgov submission applicants regions or industry clusters submit more than one ffo does not restrict the number of distinct project proposals one region or industry cluster can submit however the funding agencies request that applicants refrain from submitting multiple copies of the same application package if multiple copies of an application are received the funding agencies will only review the last application received an organization be part of more than one application team responding to the the ffo does not restrict the number of applicant teams one organization can be a member of or affiliated many organizations should form the applicant application package must be submitted by an organization or a team made up of organizations referred to as the applicant team that individually meet the eligibility requirements outlined in section iv of the ffo for each of the funding sources an individual organization or an applicant team must respond to the three distinct scopes of work for example one organization that met all the eligibility requirements could submit an application package that proposes activities for all funding alternatively two or more organizations known as an applicant team could submit an application for a project that proposes activities with each organization responsible for their portion of the scope of work for each distinct funding an mep subrecipient apply as an mep center for the funds from nist the mep subrecipient does not hold the cooperative agreement with nist mep they are not considered an existing mep center and therefore are not eligible to apply directly for the funds from nist mep the subrecipient could of course serve as part of the team assembled by the existing mep center to address sme needs for the a state agency holds the mep cooperative agreement should the cooperative agreement holder be the prime mep applicant in the the mep center ie cooperative agreement holder be represented in more than one proposal from that ffo says the mep awardee must designate fte to the does this have to be whole person or fte equivalent across several whole fte person should be assigned to the nist mep expects that one designated mep staff member will be responsible and dedicated to the success of this that will require the person assigned to have sufficient time devoted to this project to manage and collaborate our experience suggests that anything less than fte is not i lose points if my applicant team does not include an nist mep as either an eligible applicant or project will consist of one award from each of the federal funding however in the absence of an existing mep center on an applicant team nist funds will not be awarded for projects where an mep center is not reasonably available the applicant or applicant team will still be expected to respond to the scope of work by engaging appropriate smes and partners to address the outreach service delivery and technology commercialization needs of smes is a nist mep center not reasonably reasonably means that there is no mep center that can provide the desired services in the targeted region applicant teams should demonstrate why services are not available from an mep center either because there is no mep center operating in the region at the time of application or other considerations that make including an mep center on an applicant team impractical or other eligible organizations could my applicant team include if there is no nist mep center reasonably available what types of projects can that organization applicant team could include organizations such as industry associations community colleges sbdcs export promotion intermediaries university technology transfer offices or any other organizations that engage smes and partners to address the outreach service delivery and technology commercialization needs of smes those organizations would be expected to propose projects ie provide information or services that serve the needs of smes within the context of the package application package on the grantsgov website

are likely democrats while just are republicans both the overall level of turnout and the composition of the early electorate are in line with the established years ago an early positive sign for prospects in the arguably the most important demographic for democrats in north is voters who turned out at unprecedented rates vote for the president four years ago overwhelmingly support democrats and the president have cast the ballots so far in north carolina a pace on par with their years previous this is an early indication that voters in north carolina are no less excited about voting than were four years ago and that this crucial part of the continue to bolster democratic prospects for another win in carolina this huffington post october th do the math dems outpace in absentee early

http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Govern_Political/RDP_Wh.html university of pennsylvania african studies reconstruction and development programme rdp white rdp white discussion what is the reconstruction and development programme rdp do we need an the six basic principles of the rdp programmes of the rdp the rdp white paper a government for fundamental government and the introduction national government rdp structures the fund presidential projects transformation plans government and the rdp local government and the rdp review redirecting the economic policy introduction economic policy goals and objectives economic policy strategy economic growth prospects policy industrial policy trade policy competition monetary and financial policy small and enterprises labour market and human resource development welfare science and technology policy tourism public fiscal policy and the introduction the budgetary process taxation intergovernmental fiscal public sector introduction creating a broadly representative public the rdp fund and public sector restructuring rationalisation the public service revision of existing legislation and affirmative action the public service training institute productivity gains freedom of information act consultative planning introduction national strategic framework for the rdp and budget business planning process national sectoral provincial consultation participation and introduction rdp task teams the national development and labour council sectoral forums provincial local consultation for effective empowerment of women youth rural and disabled conclusion a national annexure one lead our country is going through a profound transformation at all levels government and society to ensure the implementation of the at the heart of the government of national unity is a commitment effectively address the problems of poverty and the gross evident in almost all aspects of south african society this can be possible if the south african economy can be firmly placed on path of high and sustainable the interdependence of the objectives of reconstruction and on the one hand and growth on the other is now widely accepted only within the government and the parliament but indeed south african society achieving these objectives will require national effort from all groups sectors and this white paper on the rdp sets out the initial plans of government to orientate its activities fully and effectively these the government is fully committed to policies promote the rdp as an integrated and coherent growth and the government is firmly committed to the gradual reduction in fiscal deficit thereby avoiding the debt to this end the government intends to ensure that government expenditure does not increase in real a further commitment is to reduce government dissaving over the government is committed to changing the ratio of spending towards increased capital the government is committed to financing the rdp primarily restructuring the national provincial and local government budgets shift spending programmes and activities to meet rdp the government will reorganise and train the civil service to effective and efficient services to all citizens and progressive the government will develop our human resources facilitate market reform and establish effective collective rights for all the above measures are essential if we are to succeed in the objectives contained in the this transformation will permeate every level of government department and every public institution the activities therefore should not be seen as a new set of projects rather as a comprehensive redesign and reconstruction of activities growth and development are more than interdependent are mutually reinforcing addressing inequalities will expand at home open markets abroad and create opportunities to representative ownership of the economy the expansion of the african economy will raise state revenues by expanding the tax rather than by permanently raising tax to succeed in both areas of endeavour the government will need partnership with civil society and with business and labour particular while both business and labour have the freedom in democratic south africa to protect and promote their interests it is the fervent hope that they will pursue the broader challenges of extending opportunity to the of adult south africans who can currently find no place in the the soon to be established national economic development and council will provide a process of engagement between business labour and other groups in civil society where a to common goals can be turned into collective action in the government believes that the publication of this white paper is important step in establishing the dialogue in which all south will take part to build a better society and economy for all and build our our people have elected us because they want cnange change is they will get our people have high expectations which are while the government cannot meet all these needs overnight we must firmly into place the concrete goals time frame and strategies achieve this i thank all south africans sincerely for the confidence they placed in the government of national unity and the pledge to do all our power to deliver the goods and services our people dr nelson mandela white on reconstruction and strategy for fundamental september my commitment to create a society liberty binds us to the pursuit of the goals of freedom from freedom from hunger freedom from deprivation freedom from freedom from suppression and freedom from fear these freedoms fundamental to the guarantee of human dignity they will constitute part of the centrepiece of what this government will seek achieve the focal point on which our attention will be focused the things we have said constitute the true meaning justification and the purpose of the reconstruction and programme without which it would lose all president nelson mandela in his inaugural address to a joint of parliament may south african society is in need of transformation and renewal government of national unity gnu is preparing to give direction this process by way of a new framework for governance this approach to the way we run the government must set a shining for the restructuring of the rest of our society it will be a long arduous process but will accomplish a fundamental nonetheless such renewal is a vital precondition for moving following centuries of oppression and decades of formal the policy framework behind the renewal which transforms society the reconstruction and development programme the rdp offers country a unique opportunity to bring about renewal peace reconciliation and stability it is the product of ongoing and it enjoys widespread support from all sections of our society has been adopted and supported by all political parties in the gnu in parliament and by all sectors of our society it is rare for a government to have a coherent vision it is even more unusual for vision to be supported by a national this white paper on the rdp sets out a framework for the renewal society through the own reforms it not only how the government is beginning to implement the rdp but in so doing it will expand the process of consultation participation to illustrate in response to the invitation of minister without portfolio scores of submissions on the rdp paper were made in the weeks following the election they came different offices of the government parastatal agencies forums development institutions organisations of civil business organisations and individuals all were constructive and been taken into consideration in the drafting of the rdp white president mandela defined the original rdp document as end of one process and the beginning of the document is considered the basic starting point for the rdp paper in the text it is referred to as the rdp base document underpins the approach to reconstruction and of the however the rdp must now be translated into an actual programme the government the white paper begins this task by setting strategies for the implementation of the rdp it also makes to a set of programmes adopted by ministries departments and levels of government which begin to take the rdp the rdp white paper establishes a methodology outlines government implementation strategies within the provided by the base document this allows for a coherent considered process to unfold and through the proposed reporting monitoring system provides for a meaningful evaluation of performance as well as of the performance of all of those agencies organisations from civil society involved in rdp while the white paper is a policy statement of the government also indicates how businesses unions community groups and associations organisations ngos and organisations and other groups within civil society can and contribute to the realisation of the objectives of the rdp participation is fundamental to the success of the rdp to facilitate common understanding the introduction to the rdp white paper and updates the basic strategic and programmatic approach of the this rdp white paper is therefore a further contribution to renewal of our society it states forthrightly what our citizens can expect of their government in the implementation gives directives to government officials and personnel to follow in variety of areas crucial to the successful realisation recommits the government and indeed society as a whole to the task improving the quality of life of all south africans within the possible time it does so with a strong sense of fiscal or a need to pare back the government in many areas while resources into those basic services long neglected in short recommits the government to it is through the rdp white paper that the government can embrace and support so many of the other recent and contributions to the rdp process including official government rdp documents local authority rdp programmes and and contributions of resources from across society the willingness of society to adopt the rdp is not in question what needed now and what the rdp white paper establishes is a set strategies so that together we the government and the citizens south africa can renew reconstruct and develop our great this white paper will be followed by a second white paper in evaluates progress with sets out detailed policies for economic growth and other areas of this document is white paper and it policy however it has not yet been adopted by in order to allow further discussion and debate public hearings take place during october and the finalised document will be tabled parliament for chapter what is the reconstruction and development i the reconstruction and development programme rdp is integrated coherent policy framework it seeks mobilise all our people and our resources toward the eradication of the results of apartheid and the building of democratic and future it represents a for the fundamental transformation of south africa that process of transformation must ensure that the develops strong and stable democratic institutions and characterised by representativeness and becomes a fully democratic and becomes a prosperous society having embarked upon a sustainable environmentally friendly growth and development addresses the moral and ethical development of we pursue these goals because we seek to comprehensively our lives the rdp is not an programme the purpose transformation is to create a society which progress by the extent to which it has succeeded in securing for citizen liberty prosperity and by its nature this process of renewal indeed of the birth of nation can only succeed if it involves the people themselves in act of creation as voluntary participants in the advancement the realisation of these goals they have themselves helped to in this spirit the rdp has developed through a process consultation and joint policy formulation which will continue as rdp is developed into an effective programme of the organisations within civil society will be encouraged by the gnu to active in and responsible for the effective implementation of the this inclusive approach to developing and implementing policy unique in south political history the gnu is capable unifying a wide range of social movements organisations and numerous other sectors and formations so widespread and support for the rdp continue to why do we need an our history has been a bitter one dominated by racism apartheid sexism and repressive labour policies the result that poverty and degradation exist side by side with modern cities a developed mining industrial and commercial infrastructure income distribution is racially distorted and ranks as one of the unequal in the world women are still subject to innumerable forms discrimination and bias rural people are marginalised throughout combination of lavish wealth and abject poverty characterises the economy was built on systematically enforced racial in every sphere of our society rural areas were divided underdeveloped bantustans and farming areas towns and cities were divided into townships basic infrastructure for blacks and suburbs for segregation in education health welfare transport and left deep scars of inequality and economic inefficiency violence had a devastating effect on our society and the need to restore and a sense of community security as well as the prevention domestic violence is in commerce and industry very large conglomerates dominated whites control large parts of the economy cheap labour policies employment segregation concentrated skills in white hands our are poorly equipped for the rapid changes taking place in the economy small and enterprises are underdeveloped highly protected industries underinvested in research development training the informal sector and include many south women workers who are underpaid and the result is that in every sphere of our society social legal political moral cultural environmental south are confronted by serious against these great odds our people have now achieved remarkable political transition all parties in the national have committed themselves to the rdp objectives in a common effort can begin to rebuild and stabilise our at the same time the challenges facing south africa enormous only a comprehensive approach to harnessing the resources our country can reverse the crisis created by apartheid only effort to harness the life experiences skills and aspirations of the people can lay the basis for a new south no political democracy can survive and flourish if the of its people remains in poverty without land without their needs being met and without tangible prospects for a better attacking poverty and deprivation will therefore be the first of the democratic how can we do this successfully a programme is required that achievable sustainable and meets the objectives of freedom and improved standard of living and quality of life for all south within a peaceful and stable society characterised by economic the rdp is designed to be such a programme in struggling to the objectives we face many obstacles we are setting ourselves great challenge not every expectation will be realised and not need will be met immediately the rdp provides the framework which choices can be made and within which needs can be matched affordability and factors constraining our ability to supply the involves both the government and the people in identifying needs the obstacles to satisfying those needs and will involve both jointly implementing realistic strategies to overcome these the rdp is an expression of confidence in the wisdom abilities and determination of our the six basic principles of the the challenge facing the government is to facilitate and content to the six basic principles of the rdp it is the of these principles that ensures a coherent first we require an integrated and sustainable programme legacy of apartheid cannot be overcome with piecemeal policies the rdp brings together strategies to harness all resources in a coherent and purposeful effort that can be into the future these strategies will be implemented at provincial and local level by the government parastatals business organisations within civil society all working within the framework the rdp all levels of government must pay attention to given our commitment to fiscal discipline and to achievable second this programme must become a process people with their aspirations and collective determination are most important resource the rdp is focused on immediate and it relies in turn on their energies irrespective of race or or whether they are rural or urban rich or poor the people of africa must together shape their own future development is not the delivery of goods to a passive citizenry it is about involvement and growing empowerment in taking this approach government will build on the many forums peace structures negotiations that our people are involved in through the land government therefore commits itself to maximum transparency third this programme and this process are bound up with peace and security for all promoting peace and will involve all people it will build on and expand the national for peace and combat the endemic violence faced by communities in africa with special attention to the various forms of violence which women are subjected to begin the process of reconstruction development the government will now establish security forces reflect the national and gender character of our country such will be professional and uphold the constitution respect human rights they will assist our society in developing different demilitarised ethic the judicial system will racial and gender composition and provide fairness equality for all before the law peace and political stability are central to the efforts to create an enabling to encourage investment the government also will not tolerate taking of hostages nor the wilful vandalization or destruction property decisive action will be taken to eradicate lawlessness trafficking gun running crime and especially the abuse of women fourth as peace and security are established we will be able embark upon the success of the electoral process the establishment of the gnu have set us on the road the commitment of all parties in the national to the rdp and the preparedness of important parties that stayed out the election to begin a dialogue hand in hand with the of peace and security are all contributing to the task of building we are a single country with a single economy within a constitutional framework that establishes provincial and powers respect and protection for minorities and a process accommodate those wishing to retain their cultural identity it is the basis of our unity in diversity that we will consolidate national fifth links reconstruction and development rdp is based on the notion that reconstruction and development parts of an integrated process the rdp integrates growth reconstruction redistribution and reconciliation into a programme the key to this link is an infrastructural programme will provide access to modern and effective services such electricity water telecommunications transport health and training for all our people this programme will both meet needs and open up previously suppressed economic and human potential urban and rural areas in turn this will lead to an increased in all sectors of the economy and by upgrading our infrastructure human resource development we will also enhance export capacity this process to be effective attention will be paid to those factors inhibiting growth and investment and placing obstacles in way of private sector expansion success in linking development and growth is essential if we are to achieve peace security for sixth these first five principles all depend on a democratisation of south africa minority control and privilege every aspect of our society are the main obstruction to developing integrated programme which will unleash all the resources of country and fundamentally change the way that policy is made programmes are implemented above all the people affected participate in democratisation will begin to both the state and civil society democracy is not confined to elections it is rather an active process enabling everyone contribute to reconstruction and development the government with institutions and activities has to be reviewed and restructured to the priorities of the rdp here especially there is no these principles of the rdp require clearly identified substantiated integrated goals they require organised structures can ensure coordinated action they require a socially standard of measure by which society can judge whether and progress is being made towards the phased achievement of the these principles must inspire the whole of society to accept that individual and collective welfare is best served by pursuit of the goals and programmes of the the programmes of the the five key programmes envisaged in the rdp base document meeting basic needs developing our human resources building economy democratising the state and society and implementing the will be implemented by the gnu which has a complex division of both the vertical divisions of the government especially departments and the horizontal divisions provincial and governments are either undergoing reorganisation or are established and in many cases both processes are being carried simultaneously since the rdp is designed and conceived of as integrated programme it is in itself a challenge to the abilities of the government this challenge is made more difficult the need to reorganise and establish structures within the the coordinating structures are dealt with more fully elsewhere in rdp white the five sections of the rdp base document provide the objectives and are a guide to action and a basic checklist performance for all participants in the rdp accordingly a statement of the objectives in each of those programmes is in meeting basic needs our people should become part of process on job creation land reform services water and sanitation energy telecommunications the environment nutrition health care social security and welfare they should therefore help to decide where infrastructure located be employed in its construction and be empowered participate in the management and administration of developments these major infrastructural programmes should the economy through increased demand for materials such as bricks steel appliances such as television sets and washing machines many other products in addition the industrial sector should new more efficient and cheaper products to meet basic in developing our human resources our people will be involved the process implementation new job requiring new skills gaining rewards for existing skills unrecognised and in managing and governing our society this empower them but can only succeed if there is also an education and training programme the rdp deals with education primary to tertiary level and from child care to advanced and technological training it focuses on young children students adults it deals with training in formal institutions and at the underlying approach of these programmes is that education training should be available to all learning will encouraged the rdp takes a broad view of education and seeing it not only as something that happens in schools or but in all areas of our society homes workplaces public programmes youth programmes and in rural areas a key focus the rdp is on ensuring a full and equal role for and recognition women in every aspect of our economy and society with this and with the emphasis on affirmative action throughout the rdp we unlock boundless energies and creativity suppressed by racism discrimination in training particular attention is being paid to challenges posed by the restructuring of our industries as we the world these challenges can only be met through the development of our human resources an arts and culture programme set out as a crucial component of developing our human resources will assist us in unlocking the creativity of our people allowing cultural diversity within the project of developing a unifying culture rediscovering our historical heritage and assuring adequate resources are allocated in these respects rdp policy will influenced by institutions such as the volkstaatraad and others represent the cultural interests of our diverse peoples because apartheid and a shortage of facilities sport and recreation have denied to the majority of our people yet there can be no development without there being adequate facilities sport and recreation in all communities the rdp aims to ensure all people have access to such facilities only in this way can all people have a chance to represent their villages towns provinces or country in the arena of sport and to enjoy a diversity of recreational the problems facing the youth are well known if we are develop our human resource potential then special attention must paid to the youth in particular young women our human policy should be aimed at reversing youth marginalisation by youth and allowing them to reach their full potential programmes training education and job creation will enable our youth to play full role in the reconstruction and development of our this programme for the development of our human underpins the capacity to democratise our society thus allowing to participate on the basis of knowledge skill and in building the economy we will identify our strengths tackle our weaknesses mining manufacturing agriculture financial services and infrastructure are well developed at present have a large surplus of capacity these strengths upon which we can build however so far they have benefited all our people a process of reconstruction is proposed ensure that these strengths now benefit we will also address serious weaknesses in our economy are still very clear racial and gender inequalities in employment and skills past industrial policies were an factor in developing industry but were also accompanied by labour practices neglect of training isolation from the world and excessive concentration of economic power the result is a level of investment in research and development low and skill levels high costs low productivity and declining the economy also suffers from other barriers to growth investment such as government dissaving and a comparatively proportion of our gross domestic product gdp absorbed in consumption expenditure other barriers include falling rates return capital outflows low exports and high import propensity stagnating productivity appropriate tax reforms and a review exchange controls along with fiscal discipline are all being in order to facilitate central to building the economy is the question of rights past policies of labour exploitation and repression will redressed and the imbalances of power between employers and corrected the basic rights to organise and to strike will entrenched negotiations and participative structures at industry and workplace level will be created to ensure that plays an effective role in the reconstruction and development of country negotiations have already commenced on reforms in bargaining and in the broader labour market to facilitate in the world economy the demand for raw materials minerals has not grown rapidly and there is intense competition in production of manufactured goods the general agreement on tariffs trade gatt was recently updated to achieve substantial reductions tariff levels our economy must adjust to these pressures if we are sustain economic growth and continue to develop a large manufacturing sector that makes greater use of our own raw and a central proposal of the rdp is that we cannot build the african economy in isolation from its southern african neighbours a path would benefit nobody in the long run if south africa to dominate its neighbours it would restrict their growth their potential as markets worsening their unemployment and increased migration to south africa if it seeks mutual cooperation can develop a large stable market offering stable employment common labour standards in all areas agreements on the african power pool entrance of south africa into the restructuring the southern african customs union and cooperation security lay the basis for strengthening the pressures of the world economy and the operations international organisations such as the international monetary imf world bank and gatt affect our neighbours and south africa different ways in the case of our neighbours they were pressured implementing programmes with adverse effects on employment standards of living it is essential that we combine to develop effective growth and development strategy for all southern next if we do not succeed in democratising the state society the resources and potential of our country and people will be available for a coherent programme of reconstruction development in linking democracy development and a approach to government we are paving the way for a new order the establishment of a single public service in south enjoying equitable and common conditions of service is a challenge facing the economy and the gnu important progress already been made in this regard increasing the efficiency productivity improving management and reducing the size of the service are crucial in redirecting resources to the rdp finally implementing the rdp raises many challenges because involves processes and forms of participation by organisations the government that are very different to the old apartheid order white paper deals mainly with proposals for coordinating and the implementation of the the rdp white paper a government strategy for the structure of the main body of the rdp white paper is meant assist both personnel of the gnu and all south africans who are an active role in the implementation of the the rdp is a vision for the fundamental transformation in society it is the duty of the government to manage transformation this is being done by the development of key medium programmes which incorporate the basic aims of the rdp which allow for effective management these programmes have launched through presidential projects announced recently by president in his speech opening the debate on the vote the projects the implementation of the rdp and provide a useful learning experience to improve the strategies in a dynamic the white paper begins by outlining the role of the levels of government in the rdp chapter next an overview government economic policies is provided to illustrate the environment that will link growth reconstruction and chapter the rdp white paper then considers fiscal policy the budget chapter the reorganisation of the public particularly the public service and other government personnel is taken up chapter reorganisation can be facilitated through adoption of rigorous planning frameworks chapter six which relation to civil society enhance consultation popular and chapter through implementation of rdp in this manner a national consensus will be reached consensus is critical to meeting basic needs developing our resources building the economy and democratising the state society it is critical to the reconstruction and development of society at this important point of our transition chapter sets conclusions and poses major challenges to government and civil chapter nine is an overview of short to medium term programmes of departments of government to be chapter the government and the in implementing the transformation of society the first priority is to transform the way the government itself this lays the groundwork for the involvement of other sectors society coordinated efficient transparent and government is a basic premise of the the government will take the lead role in implementing the but with clear criteria so that all citizens can become involved implementation and can monitor the progress together government and the people of south africa will give renewed priority the provision of goods and services to meet basic needs develop human resources build the economy and democratise the state this chapter of the rdp white paper outlines the different of the government the constitution provides for different of government at national provincial and local levels and competencies and powers to each when the final constitution adopted these competencies and powers will set the parameters for roles of different tiers of government over the coming years it anticipated however that every office of government from smallest village council to the largest national department will to be restructured to take forward the the government through a process of consultation with stakeholders and the different tiers of government has identified following programmes as the key medium and programmes drive implementation of the meeting basic urban and rural democratisation and institutional economic these programmes relate closely to the major principles set in the rdp base document the programmes will include projects that carefully identified and selected compilation of project plans performance monitoring to support and ensure compliance project business plans and reporting of salient national government rdp the national government will set the broad objectives of the and together with the provincial and local governments will provide policy and regulatory framework to facilitate its implementation provincial and local level it is setting up rdp funding processes the context of sound fiscal policies it will provide monitoring statistical auditing and performance assessment for rdp it will facilitate intergovernmental consensus and restructure and reorientate the public service towards the goals of rdp a variety of structures are already being formed to carry these the president is leading the transformation and renewal of society and is responsible for the overall coordination of the the special cabinet committee on the rdp comprises ministers the departments responsible for policy formulation and of the rdp is coordinated by the minister without portfolio special cabinet committee assist in formulating rdp policies and ensure interdepartmental and intergovernmental set goals targets and develop an institutional framework and change management including performance ensure adequate funding of monitor and evaluate progress with coordinate the preparation of link rdp planning to the budget establish a and information management a core committee constituted by the ministers deputy and of finance and state expenditure administration constitutional development public works and the of the president supports the work of the special cabinet within parliament the standing committee on the rdp provide input on rdp policy and receive and review reports and provide a direct link between the government and the grassroots the implementation of the rdp through their constituency conduct public hearings on key aspects of the evaluate progress with implementation in consultation with standing committees responsible for other review and promote the annual report on the rdp will be submitted to standing committee in conjunction with the annual budget review annual report will set out rdp programmes and projects and successes and failures it will assist in cementing the between the rdp and the budget which is the expression of priorities and should thus conform to the priorities the this review will better enable parliament and the public judge the way in which the government has used the funds voted in budget and focus budget debates more clearly on rdp other standing committees with jurisdiction over implementation will have similar rights and particularly with respect to the budgetary process and monitoring parliamentarians also have a vital role in implementation and monitoring and their ability to fuse the of local constituencies with the process of governance will become and more important as the rdp is tested on the ground like all institutions of government parliament should review its structures and rules in order to advance the rdp significant has already been made in this the minister without portfolio has convened task teams to interdepartmental and intergovernmental cooperation around implementation of the rdp these task teams comprise representatives appropriate national departments provincial administrations parastatals with the assistance of technical experts representatives of appropriate organisations of civil society the briefs are facilitate cooperation and integration of planning and between government departments and with all levels of develop methodologies to facilitate advise on implementation of monitor the implementation and impact of integrated advise the special cabinet committee on the rdp on interdepartmental task teams have been established in following areas and others are being created as human resource and capacity urban rural the cabinet is also establishing a committee of ministers economic issues to develop a growth strategy the working preparing for the establishment of the national economic and labour council nedlc has proposed that the committee be of the ministers of trade and industry finance public works science and technology mineral and energy affairs and the without portfolio the cabinet will finalise the committee and committee will work closely with the under the minister without development branch several existing planning and information bodies will restructured into a core policy and planning capacity this include the central economic advisory services ceas the statistical service css the national productivity institute among others in the process of restructuring the role and function these bodies will be reformed in line with rdp and requirements with a leaner but more coordinated system and planning the development planning will support the government its agencies and other institutions development planning and change management strategies as well setting out a draft urban development policy and draft development policy this will occur in consultation interdepartmental rdp task teams provincial and local governments civic movement and organised business the development planning will aim to have completed an initial draft for submission to the special cabinet committee the rdp parliamentary standing committee the nedlc by march such policy frameworks are contributions to a national development procedures are being developed by the public service the commission on provincial government and line function to access and possibly rationalise the policy capacity of institutions all these agencies will provide support to national function departments and to other institutions involved in the rdp is implemented through the programmes of the line function departments and particularly of provincial and governments the rdp office is not in competition with departments the office of the minister without portfolio is not implementing agency nor are rdp coordinating structures in government without detracting from emerging forms of amongst ministries the rdp office will ensure effective management the transformation to this end the intergovernmental forum has been this forum is to provide an opportunity for consultation and between ministers representing the national and the premiers of the respective provinces on any matter of interest including matters pertaining to the rdp the forum will on a monthly basis and is to be attended twice annually by president and the deputy executive presidents the permanent members the forum are the provincial premiers the minister for affairs and constitutional development the minister without responsible for the rdp and the ministers of finance and for the service and administration the respective ministers and premiers each to be assisted by their the intergovernmental forum is to be supported by intergovernmental technical committee which comprises of the departments of constitutional development chairperson state expenditure finance office of the without portfolio office of the public service commission and as well as those of the nine provincial administrations this will assist the intergovernmental forum on technical matters and like the intergovernmental forum a crucial structure to coordinated and cooperation regarding the rdp intergovernmental a number of ministerial forums between national responsible for schedule functions and their provincial have also been established these forums who will also be supported their respective technical committees consisting of senior officials the provincial and national line function departments can also play crucial role with regard to the rdp as their briefs include policy and strategy formulation and the coordination of the efficient and effective employment of the transfer of national norms and standards governing the performance of the interaction between the financial and fiscal which advises on the fiscal transfers and financial arrangements support those strategies and the commission on provincial will be crucial to ensure that all levels of government are working harmony to implement the the rdp the rdp fund is vital for both the reform of the government the implementation of the rdp it is established in terms of the fund act of and is administered by the ministry of allocation of funds is controlled by the minister without the goals of the fund are to start the key programmes of the rdp leverage the entire budget to the new priorities to institutional reform and to facilitate the restructuring of the sector in particular the rdp fund will assist the government directing expenditure away from consumption and towards there are several sources for the rdp fund first the fund initially draw its resources from money appropriated by parliament the fund through savings by the departments in the budget billion was allocated to the rdp fund this amount will increase to billion in and will progressively increase to r billion and r billion thereafter future decisions on rdp allocations will be made on the basis of its effectiveness as a for rdp implementation in effect therefore the rdp fund consists funds which have been removed from departmental allocations and can reassigned to them subject to compliance with the new leadership of ministers and proper strategic planning by departmental management will be encouraged to deliver on the within the framework of the rdp second the receipt of international and grant aid will be directed to the fund the process of has normalised relationships with the international community allows access to the broadest possible international financial base interdepartmental committee has been established from the of finance state expenditure trade and industry foreign affairs the office of the minister without portfolio as well as the ceas consider the aid offers of donor nations and multilateral agencies committee will further investigate and negotiate with donors on utilisation of aid for the funding of rdp programmes with a view optimising the use of grant aid and of concessionary finance as part integrated funding packages for each programme major conferences are being held with donors to facilitate this careful attention will be given to assessing both the appropriate and applications of foreign support and conditions which attach to funds where grant aid is utilised care will be taken that grants in rdp programmes are for programmes and do not entail through costs to be accommodated in budgets in years unless this has been included in forward planning concessional loans are granted care will be taken to assess effective cost given currency depreciation donors have emphasised need for coordination of aid and for clear priorities from government the arrangements now adopted have been developed consultation with them it is expected that all departments provinces will liaise with the interdepartmental committee soliciting third the rdp fund will benefit from interest earned from investment of money standing to the credit of the fourth the rdp fund will benefit from proceeds from the sale state assets the government recognises that the location composition of state assets may not be optimal and has begun an to dispose of those assets not relevant to the fifth the rdp fund will draw upon other sources of including revenue from lotteries and gambling these are huge sources of revenue and a very high percentage of earnings accrue to the programmes of the local government is in the process of redirecting funds utilisation within its total area of jurisdiction the exact value this redirection is not determinable at present but over a period years could represent a substantial amount of financial and presidential the programmes and processes of the rdp must lead to initiation management and completion of fundamental change in this transformation will happen over a period of time the goals of rdp and the broader purpose of the rdp fund are to create and institutional reform and changes in the procedures and content of in his state of the nation address to parliament on may the president set out certain projects which would launch the of the rdp in the first days the task teams in consultation national departments and the provincial administrations then specific projects which could be initiated within the days while the same time launching the key programmes set out above the chosen were required to conform with the following high impact on the communities they empowerment of these economic and political viability and job provision of basic training and capacity affirmative action with respect to gender and potential to leverage funds from old priorities to new priorities requiring departments to provide matching funds from their budgets to carry all recurrent costs other than in very exceptional cases recurrent costs will be some existing capacity to start the projects have been approved by the cabinet subject to processes first there must be analysis of the recurrent costs generated by the project the department of expenditure has analysed these costs and ensured that they can accommodated by allocations from the rdp fund alternatively minister and accounting officer concerned must undertake in that funds will be found in future budgets of the relevant such forward planning will be a prerequisite for all projects wholly or partly from the rdp fund this process has initiated in the budgeting process in addition projects must be without increasing staffing levels except in authorised standard format business plans are being devised for project this is dealt with in more detail later and is intended become a standard for all programmes of the government at all the focus of the presidential projects is therefore on initiating changes in government spending priorities and utilisation launching beginning delivery of concrete benefits to disadvantaged the presidential projects have already taught the the rdp fund is not intended to provide money for a selection isolated projects while they may be deserving in themselves will only be funded from the rdp fund if they have implications for communities and for the transformation strategy there probably remains a tendency amongst government and communities to view the rdp as merely a collection of large small development projects they therefore expect the between themselves and the minister without portfolio and the of finance to be purely related to funding as a result communities and all provincial governments are in the process drafting their own rdps with an external funding orientation in whether from the rdp fund or development this is commendable in so far as it unlocks creativity political energy the initiatives taken around the rdp at levels are extremely encouraging however in view of the very constraints on the rdp fund it will clearly not be possible to from this source alone the vast majority of projects set out in and provincial rdps the focus of local community rdps must focus on among other things the reform of local spending the allocation of resources including staff the reform of government practices increased consultation transparency accountability and improved service this transformation focus should also be the major concern provincial rdps as a result those development projects which solely funded from external sources whether from the rdp fund development aid will be the exception most projects have to be funded either from existing funds of the local or governments or from the line function departments of the government some can be funded from the r million which has allocated to the national public works programme npwp from the fund and the discretionary funds made available to the administrations for this purpose from the rdp fund in total within its constraints government will look more on community projects to which the community makes in particular provincial and local governments should required to implement efficiency programmes and to review all programmes and projects in the same way as is now expected of national government in spite of this reorientation it is clear there is and will continue to be a huge shortfall in the funds communities local and provincial governments and national departments regard as essential for their transformation all line function departments and provinces have been asked prepare a five year strategy to reorientate their programmes their efficiency and enhance their use of resources consistent with rdp president mandela commented in his days speech of line with the objectives of the rdp we will by the end of year require clear medium and strategies from departments and parastatal institutions on mechanisms of shifting operations to meet the requirements of reconstruction and difficult choices will have to be made to close programmes in order redirect resources and staff to rdp he continued in his speech closing the presidential budget debate on means a new culture within the government as a whole to management by the ministers and the office of the yet we should constantly improve on this to ensure that we do allowa sense of unguided drift at any level of must ensure constant monitoring and timely interventions necessary to reorientate all departments to the major national tasks hand this includes a system of regular reports from ministries on basis of guidelines dictated by reconstruction and in order to improve efficiency and the effective utilisation resources programmes must be based on clear business plans plans must provide for clear and measurable outputs and for assessment of performance by means of defined indicators the and format of business plans as well as key performance indicators ensure uniform performance appraisal indicators must be reported the level of management to enable management to assess its compliance with the business plan key performance indicators encapsulate the output from programmes are required to be regularly to the minister responsible for each indicators which reflect more general progress departments and broad programmes will be reported regularly to president and the cabinet an annual evaluation of the rdp and transformation process will be reported to parliament based indicators which specify the results of all programmes funded from budget with indicators of effectiveness and compliance with aims and goals indicators will be developed or adapted to allow other things the reporting of issues such as accountability affirmative action accelerated empowerment of communities freedom from fear of crime and recreation and educational implementation of transformation strategies is an difficult management exercise departments will have to situate strategies within short medium and goals and a systematic business planning exercise for each ministry tier government and parastatal institution will be facilitated if by the office of the president public enterprises and the sector will also be requested to make expertise available to assist part of the preparation for a change strategy and a business ministries and institutions will be asked to define and agree on performance indicators and reporting procedures to comply with an act to be called the rdp act will be tabled in parliament set out the procedures which the government and its agencies follow in complying with this report in particular the budget will be linked on a programmatic basis to the annual evaluation of rdp and will link rdp categories and programmes to those in the for the purposes of the review and the evaluation the accounts will also be redrawn to allow evaluation of the progress reconstruction and provincial government and the south africa is characterised by uneven development with poverty in many parts of the country basic infrastructure is in poorer areas of most provinces in all provinces the distribution of resources is extremely uneven each province develop a strategy for implementing the rdp in the context of particular provincial administrations and legislatures have been to establish similar coordinating structures of members of committees mecs and of members of the legislatures and similar teams to assist in the process of provincial and local delivery all the provinces have established responsibility for the rdp either in office of the premier or in the office of the mec responsible economic in some provinces regional economic forums and the statutory regional development advisory committees merged a process the minister without portfolio will encourage in provinces so as to facilitate formal inputs to provincial involving all stakeholders these new provincial bodies will be linked to the new statutory economic development and labour council to ensure consistent coherent national and provincial policy provincial governments carry out rdp activities in accordance with their responsibilities under the introduce the necessary reforms to meet the conditions for implementation and devolution of the rdp consult with local communities on rdp distribute untied funds to local communities in accordance conditions contained in the rdp contract with the national advocate for capital works funding for conduct operations in such a way as to meet the monitoring auditing requirements of the national provincial rdp coordinating mechanisms will be geared towards developmental planning and delivery although individual function departments and the provinces will have relationships it is desirable that overall integrating mechanisms established provincial rdp offices will develop policy capacity either on a contract basis from other levels of government from the private sector universities and civil what is most crucial in all of this is that the rdp is reduced to a collection of projects but instead becomes an programme to transform all levels of society some of the provincial governments must address are restructuring of the provincial budgets to reflect the priorities the restructuring of the public service at provincial development of institutional capacity to implement the the engagement of civil society labour community business in a meaningful process to implement the harnessing and unlocking the political and creative energies of communities to ensure a truly these provincial strategies for implementing the rdp should presented to the minister without portfolio as well as to intergovernmental with respect to functions powers and resources the implies that provincial governments can only receive for functions when the national government is that adequate capacity exists to undertake those responsibilities national government in consultation with provincial governments draw up a checklist to facilitate the devolution of rdp programmes the provinces negotiations on devolution will take explicit account several factors these the provincial capacity to implement major development roles for organisations and increasing the capacity of people to work in groups and identification and mobilisation of local maximum local area assessment of needs and in addition the constitution requires that allocations provinces out of the national fiscal resources equitable and distributed on the basis of financial and commission formulae equality also implies that the cost of delivery is not excessive finally the national government that all audit and monitoring functions be vested in the national department or associated local government and the the national government wishes to unlock the political creative energies of the people and bring the government closer to people in this regard local governments have an important role play the national government together with the commission provincial affairs and provincial governments will ensure coordination of the development process maintenance of standards the coherence of change management strategies local governments critical financial problems and will have to find new strategies together with the provincial and national government an hoc committee of parliament including the departments of local government and the office of the minister without portfolio initiated this process in general local authorities are key institutions for basic services extending local control managing local development and redistributing public resources however for first time in south history emerging democratic authorities must work with organisations and ngos establish minimum conditions of good governance and to effective development because the rdp depends on democracy and social stability local communities the management of institutional change and delivery of municipal services must occur simultaneously restoring upgrading services where they have collapsed and extending services new areas are vital preconditions for the continued legitimising of new local authorities improved services must be implemented in manner which enhances appropriate institutional change within local authorities must ensure that sufficient resources are available for the extension and upgrading of municipal services for to permit structures to assist local planning and implementation of the upgrading local will need additional sources of revenue for operating maintenance subsidy expenses as well as staff retraining and some new however such funding will be conditional upon a set of which demonstrate local good faith in moving to as rapidly as possible rdp funding will be made available only amalgamation of different jurisdictions proceeds effectively if budgets are adopted for a single municipal area and if the government electoral process is under way the transitional authority will gain access to increased resources only if it developmental in its orientation proactive in winning the trust of local residents sensitive to issues of affordability creative financing and more efficient in delivery of services local must demonstrate that they are already in the transitional shifting resources staff management equipment skills their spending priorities freezing clearly inappropriate projects engaging in consultation with community groups through such means will be feasible to build new local institutions which will take rdp in sum the establishment of democratic and processes in local governments are vital in most rural areas the third tier of government does not exist provincial government be encouraged to initiate a process of building local government process should be driven by local communities themselves in where there are interminable delays in implementing the government transition act where interim councils are not appointed where boundary disputes are debilitating and preparation for the local government elections is not effectively the provincial government will use its power to the principle of payments for services is fundamental to implementation of the rdp with due cognisance of administrative constraints and an equitable and fair default programme review redirecting there will be a tendency for inertia when existing programmes the government at all levels are reviewed for the purpose redirecting expenditure and resources in the planning and process it is therefore essential that departments and tiers government place all programmes on an equal footing in funds staff and resources programmes should not be funded and staffed purely because they have been established similarly a programme should not be prejudiced because it is new it is only if this process of review a takes place that significant redirection of can occur otherwise most rdp programmes will remain as chapter the economic policy the gnu inherited an economy characterised by a number structural problems these are fully set out in the base document will not be repeated here the challenge is to correct those and regenerate economic growth and a more equitable distribution of benefits of such the role of the government and the public sector in within the broader economy has to be redefined so that and development are facilitated in a wide range of areas the gnu take the lead to bring about reform and readdress structural however in doing so its guidelines will remain the basic principles the rdp namely a approach democratisation and creating and enabling environment for the sector to grow and increase the level of participation in economic activity by all employment creation is the central priority we have to the low levels of investment and saving the outward flow of and generally improve the environment for productive investment addition the gnu will facilitate labour intensive methods in the sector through the national public works programme administered by department of public it is essential that there is greater participation in economy and that existing ownership patterns become less more racially inclusive and that small medium and micro account for a substantially larger part of economic activity programmes will require that we address the discriminatory practices the past that have left a legacy of in the labour market discriminatory practices of the past distorted collective bargaining and left our workforce with a and inadequate skill base in both these areas substantial progress been made in recent years and we will now build on and accelerate economic policy goals and the rdp provides a strategic framework to address these in that it recognises the interrelatedness and the necessity of basic needs developing human resources building the economy democratising the state and society in implementing these changes are necessary in institutional arrangements as well as in orientation of policy reconstruction and development will be through the leading and enabling role of the state a thriving sector and active involvement by all sectors of civil the central goal for reconstruction and is to meet the social and economic needs of the people and to create strong dynamic and balanced economy which create jobs that are sustainable and increase the ability of economy to absorb new in both the formal and less alleviate the poverty low wages and extreme inequalities in and wealth generated by the apartheid system meet basic needs thus ensure that every south african has a decent living standard economic address economic imbalances and structural problems in trade commerce mining agriculture finance and labour integrate into the world economy utilising the growing home base in manner that sustains a viable and efficient domestic capacity and increases the potential to export address economic imbalances and uneven development within and south ensure that no one suffers discrimination in hiring promotion training on the basis of race or develop the human resource capacity of all south africans so economy achieves high skills and democratise the economy and empower the historically particularly the workers and their organisations by broader participation in decisions about the economy in both private and public sector create productive employment opportunities a living wage for all south develop a prosperous and balanced regional economy in southern based on the principle of equity and mutual the rdp will foster a new and constructive relationship the people their organisations in civil society key such as the trade unions and organised business the government the workings of the the government can only achieve its economic objectives if establishes transparent participatory and accountable procedures in both the public and private sectors the government trade union and civic movements business associations and relevant organisations of civil society must cooperate in economic policy the government will review the inherited departments and agencies to streamline policy making implementation and to define appropriate relationships with forums the various tiers of government the national economic development labour council will extend and enhance the work of the economic forum as a consultative economic growth is critical for sustainable improvements services and incomes we must shape the expansion of the social economic infrastructure to stimulate industry and agriculture policies must be coordinated with the development on a basis of the southern african region as a the economic policies require human development on massive scale improved training and education fundamental to higher employment the introduction of more technologies and reduced inequalities higher labour productivity be the result of new attitudes towards work and especially new in the context of overall economic reconstruction and development and better management skills are urgently basic to the consultative and interactive approach to policy are the protection of worker rights and labour standards proactive labour market policies the rdp makes a decisive break the exploitative cheap labour policies of apartheid and moves education training skills a living wage and collective bargaining the basis for enhanced productivity in the gender equality is also a major objective of economic market failure often exacerbates discrimination which already within the government and the wider society leading among things to artificial notions of and employment discrimination in public works projects unpaid labour women credit constraints for women with limited insufficient resource allocation to early child care and poor nutrition gender discrimination in law enforcement and of perpetrators of domestic violence discriminatory treatment on basis of marital status or pregnancy and insufficient public services objectives include identifying and addressing aspects of government practice and economic management and particular increasing training opportunities for women parental rights improving credit subsidies and innovative schemes ensuring the public provision of child care and competition policy to benefit an economic policy to these ends economic policy must specifically address problems on the basis of its strengths the gnu draws on following basic strategy to achieve its financial and monetary discipline in order to finance the reprioritise public sector activity and facilitate restructuring and the establishment of fair and equitable user the establishment of an economic environment conducive to trade and industry policies designed to foster a greater orientation so as to sustain high employment levels and levels participation in the a modernisation of human resource programmes to meet the of changing production a reform of labour market institutions in order to effective and equitable collective bargaining and restructuring employment these areas are interrelated and are designed to bring structural changes in the economy that will achieve sustainable viable employment creation and a movement to full employment participation in the economy leading to reduced income disparities a labour market characterised by effective collective bargaining equitable system of rights active policies to address patterns and the government has already acted decisively to bring about structured change in fiscal policy and this will begin to have desired effects the immediate challenge facing government was the need to finance and staff the rdp exacerbating the unacceptably high government debt in consumption expenditure has risen to more than per cent of gdp interest repayment is absorbing more than per cent of the increasingly the market evaluation of such a situation was that government could not curb expenditure dissaving would continue balance of payments would be adversely affected and that would rise as a result interest rates subsequently rose which turn increased the government debt burden ln the context of instability other crucial objectives would therefore not only has the rdp fund financed with constraints in mind the overall process for taking forward the rdp is geared to cutting government expenditure wherever possible problems faced the government in achieving this objective in budget these were the additional transition costs and incorporation of debt incurred by the tbvc territories this raised stock of debt and interest payments that were previously accounted as intergovernmental transfers for the first time an overall revenue fund indicating revenue and expenditure by national regional government within south africa was set out thereby a substantial part of the additional transitional costs was for by a levy stringent steps are being taken to curb expenditure and no additional expenditure is authorised unless passes the rigorous tests of the treasury guideline figures for the budget have already circulated and they again reflect no real increase in expenditure the guideline figures also achieved no real increase the deficit before borrowing as a percentage of gdp it should also borne in mind that in an amount of r billion was allocated the rdp fund this effectively imposes lower real expenditure departments which can be corrected by recourse to the rdp fund process set out in more detail in the next a process of coordinating and identifying all assistance has been decided upon this ensures that the government not incur further debt through such assistance and that it is in the most effective by acting with the requisite fiscal and monetary discipline reorganising the financial relations of national provincial and governments we will ensure that the public impact on will be positive the public sector will better its resources increase capital expenditure have relatively resources for meeting needs rather than paying interest and private sector in addition a stable price environment will assist in restructuring of industry and of collective bargaining improvements in social wages on a viable basis will also be by stable prices since an effective user charge system can a combination of factors therefore demonstrates the commitment to reducing consumption expenditure these forcing the government to reprioritise its expenditure rather seeking new sources of the redirection of consumption expenditure to capital through the rdp an additional decrease in consumption expenditure in the service by not filling all vacancies created by natural a systematic change management programme linked to assessment required forward planning on all projects and the introduction of systematic business plans for all projects programmes of the economic growth the levels of net domestic saving and net domestic have declined to alarmingly low levels this must be urgently the first steps began with the election of the gnu and remarkable political transition the country has in the previous section of this document some of the steps government has taken to consolidate confidence were set out however number of other policy areas must be addressed to improve the environment for investment and in the budget corporate taxation was addressed lowering of corporate tax combined with the increase on secondary on companies favoured reinvestment and growth there were limits to the extent to which other adjustments could be made other major issues such as tax on married women and vat on basics were also under consideration it was decided to this to a tax commission in order to take a considered approach to the however the president has made a clear commitment to increasing the general level of tax what is being considered is specific composition of the tax the fundamental goal of the rdp is an economy which will ultimately lead to full secondly redistribution must occur to alleviate poverty in the of meeting basic needs the rdp takes the view that neither growth by itself or redistribution on its own will resolve the crisis in which south africa finds itself therefore to achieve successful economy the government will adopt an integrated approach reconstruction and development this will involve the promotion of more equitable pattern of growth an equitable distribution of services and access to markets and the maintenance of in addition to the series of immediate measures undertaken by government to begin to address the structural deficiencies in the african economy the rdp provides a consistent coherent within which several key economic initiatives including involving investment trade industrial strategy competition business and labour markets can be applied simultaneously and in mutually reinforcing manner such an interlinked approach is the means of overcoming structural barriers to growth including unemployment poor social infrastructure inequitable distribution primary product export dependence and protection the next sections of this document describe initiatives in this investment the government will make substantial public investments so as meet the basic needs of all citizens and in particular disadvantaged the government will also encourage private investment areas not previously explored a successful growth strategy critically on an increase in productive investment from both public private sources public investment in sectors of the economy aimed alleviating poverty such as construction and building communication health and human resource development would also attract private investment once they are developed as more the government is committed to creating an enabling that will encourage private investment by facilitating markets and by redressing the distortions of the past the sector will be encouraged to enhance its competitive edge in new product lines that not only serve the domestic market but gain access to the international the government welcomes foreign investment in accordance with objectives for growth and development the rdp accepts that the to attracting foreign investment is by establishing a climate political stability economic growth and transparent stable consistent policies the implementation of the entire rdp is the guarantee to attract investment from both domestic and foreign the principle of national treatment will apply to investors who would enjoy the same treatment as domestic investors would be obliged to abide by south african laws subject to administered by the south african reserve bank foreign investors have access to foreign exchange for the purpose of remitting profits and debt service or approved loans purchasing inputs repatriating proceeds on the sale of investment would be attracted into areas which stimulate competitiveness of the south african economy the is committed to creating an enabling environment that will investment by facilitating efficient markets and by redressing distortions of the industrial the objectives of the industrial policy employment generation increased investments improved performance and enhanced productivity attaining these goals require a focus on both the restructuring of existing industries the correct identification of new areas of industrial especially in ways which will encourage the adding of maximum value the natural resource endowment a new approach to policy will require a commitment from the entire nation tripartite decision making which draws contributions from government labour and reconstruction of the economy must be linked to development the process a more dynamic manufacturing sector will emerge as growing source of productive and employment opportunities industrial learning the present weakness of the manufacturing must be judged in terms of the global trend in which markets manufactured commodities are growing more rapidly than those natural investments that follow the logic of the rdp offer opportunities for south african industry in particular investments will be made in electricity health housing telecommunications and the information infrastructure transport public works such as roads water and sanitation this expenditure take place primarily in order to provide for basic needs infrastructure manufacturers and service industries will have opportunities to design efficient attractive products processes which are appropriate for local conditions and could important export in this respect the rdp provides a challenge to design and processes which will also have a ready market in areas such south america africa eastern europe asia and the pacific already products designed for community telecommunications and for electrification have proved extremely successful in the market the rdp creates a large local market for industry which it to design and develop products with a stable home base this provides the predictability to allow the extensive restructuring is needed to make the industries more efficient effective for instance the domestic appliance industry expects local market to increase by millions of new consumers and is restructuring itself and designing new the government should facilitate the response of industry to challenge rather than undirected incentives support should directed at those sectors which can respond to rdp investment growth areas this support will take the form of among other things provision of training research and development design acquisition and export in addition to direct local linkages between manufacturing the rdp sectoral policies will be aimed at five objectives which create sustainable employment and growing industries first government will aim to extend the international competitive edge selected industries second light manufacturing receive support if they show the potential to emerge from protection third the void between primary commodity industries manufacturing industries will be filled through encouragement of forward linkages and minerals beneficiation the government will support sectors which are and can directly and indirectly create fifth the government will drive industrialisation towards activities and to raise productivity through resource development work reorganisation democratisation of workplace and technological in the highly concentrated domestic market the government pursue a competition policy designed to reform those market that underpin high prices and complacency and that constitute entry barriers to small and enterprise market alone will however not be sufficient to revitalise the sector policy and resources will be redirected at strengthening resources and technological capacities including those relating smaller in general industrial is a process that upon comprehensive commitment by the nation the government endorses those tripartite processes already contributing to policy formulation these processes will be strengthened institutionalised similarly the government will restructure refocus those major institutions of industrial policy including board of tariffs and trade and the industrial development idc small business development corporation sbdc the sa bureau standards sabs the agriculture research council arc council scientific and industrial research csir and other institutions that have hitherto served sectional trade the objective of trade policy reform is to ensure that trading patterns contribute as much as possible to overall rdp objectives including a broader and development of the southern african region trade policy including improving productivity and competitiveness will integrated into the overall restructuring of the the democratisation of south africa has resulted in new being opened for south african goods and services via the system of preferences and the granting of the most favoured trade policy must ensure a greater quantity of exports from south africa a process largely dependent upon application of an effective industrial policy south africa continue to participate in multilateral bodies which regulate such participation will be characterised by a linkage with developing with regard to protection this would mean continuing the commitment to gradual but steady trade liberalisation in all sectors the economy as espoused in the gatt agreement the government nevertheless make use of socially responsible supply assist sensitive industries in adapting in order to overcome stronger international competition such measures include assistance the retraining of workers and the enhancement better utilisation of technology measures and countervailing strategies will also be introduced to protect manufacturers from unfair foreign trade practices other elements the new trade policy include programmes designed to realise exporting potential of small and enterprises which tend be more this will assist new enterprises businesses in their attempts to enter trade policy and foreign policy need to be integrated and seen part of a broader strategy to strengthen relations democratise international institutions and thereby to ensure a deal for developing countries south africa will seek new relationships with countries and regional associations which can important partners in this process the extension of the system of preferences to south africa by several countries and the favoured nation trade agreement with india bode well for competition the south african economy must be opened to greater participation by a greater number of its people the government introduce strict legislation to create a more and dynamic business environment the central objectives of legislation are to discourage systematically the system of where it leads to of economic power and directorships to abolish numerous practices such market domination and abuse and to prevent the exploitation consumers existing government institutions and regulations with competition policy will be reviewed in accordance with the policy the government will establish a commission to the structure of control and competition in the economy and efficient and democratic solutions to that end it will changes in regulation or management in addition to antitrust a credible competition policy is crucial to the functioning of the economy objectives of this policy are to remove reduce the distorting effects of excessive economic concentration corporate conglomeration collusive practices and the abuse economic power by enterprises in a dominant position in addition policy will ensure that participation of efficient small enterprises in the economy is not jeopardised structures and the government will also seek to increase the competitive of domestic markets and to influence the behaviour of the participants in highly concentrated markets in a socially manner which does not prejudice the interests of workers government will identify and eliminate practices that restrict entry efficient and competitive new businesses into certain industries to eliminate illegal practices such as the maintenance of prices collusion between companies in market distribution horizontal collusion in respect of supply and tendering competition board will be restructured and monetary and financial the constitution asserts the need for the independence of south african reserve bank so as to ensure that it is insulated partisan interference and is accountable to the broader goals reconstruction and development the main functions of the reserve are to maintain the value of the currency to keep inflation low and to ensure the safety and soundness of the financial the government will support innovative financial institutions instruments which promote domestic savings and extend services to those who do not have adequate access to these services particular financing for housing and for small and enterprises will be mobilised the government will discourage institutions from discriminating on the grounds of race and small and in line with the objectives of economic policy growth employment can be enhanced through government support to small enterprises the institutional framework of support such enterprises will be fundamentally restructured the will determine appropriate support policies which will be both and sectorally differentiated support to this sector will best decided by the government the private sector and ngos acting the key areas of support to small and will access to favourable amendments to legislative and regulatory access to marketing and access to access to infrastructure and access to access to appropriate encouragement of women in particular are involved in will receive increased government assistance discussion is needed the problems of credit and venture capital access to finance research and development simplification not elimination of regulatory environment and improved competition policy enterprises which allow women to develop especially in the areas will be encouraged these include stokvels informal electricity and water in recognising the value of this sector in the generation of employment and competitiveness the government will endeavour to small and medium enterprises into the regulatory framework for the government and especially public enterprises will the entry of entrepreneurs into opportunities which arise from the investments these include especially the sale installation servicing of domestic appliances and wiring construction and manufacturing and service activities such as software the will encourage entrepreneurs to move into the manufacturing since the restriction of small and medium enterprises to retailing distribution will severely inhibit the growth and viability of sector the government will therefore encourage entrepreneurs to technical training and joint ventures with the formal labour market and human resource given the extremely high unemployment rate economic strategies must focus on improving labour absorption while technical and institutional needs and labour absorption may differ across sectors the general foundation for employment is a literate numerate and healthy work force the government helped to consolidate the labour relations act to this government labour policies will be formulated to assist the vulnerable among the unemployed particularly rural women and youth the government will also promote techniques such as audits in local communities other means of unblocking logjams prevent effective operation of the labour market will be accredited training programmes will be established in the context the national qualifications framework the npwp using methods of delivery training and socially determined wages increase employment associated with the creation and upgrading infrastructure the framework agreement on labour construction offers an important tripartite cooperation in this the rdp will also safeguard and extend the gains that have already won there will be equal rights for all workers the to strike and the right to information about employers all should be entitled to a living wage and humane conditions of in a healthy and safe environment affirmative action policies will used to end discrimination on the grounds of race and gender and address the disparity of power between workers and employers as as between urban and rural areas the government will protect integrity of the collective bargaining system parties to collective bargaining process will be encouraged to settle amicably without prejudice to their rights under the constitution any law national industrial bargaining forums have an important namely to negotiate industrial policy training and programmes job placement and job creation programmes and the industrial democracy will facilitate greater participation and decision making in the workplace the empowerment workers will be enhanced through access to company information resource development and education and training are key inputs policies aimed at higher employment the introduction of more technologies and reduced inequalities discrimination on the of race and gender must end parties to collective bargaining will encouraged to negotiate affirmative action policies to discrimination and the disparities of power between workers it is unfortunately true that many communities and depend almost entirely on the cash from pensions and disability even though there has been a high level of dependency upon services many who are entitled to grants or pensions do not them old people in rural areas and the mentally ill are vulnerable in this the efficiency of delivery of welfare to all who have entitlement will be improved the government will act against technology and the creativity of local and authorities will be harnessed to ensure that pensions and grants delivered where people live in order to eliminate excessive travel long waiting periods and that corruption is eliminated as far possible by incorporating audit the government will consult with civil society to ability to target subsidies this is especially to ensure that tariffs for services which in general must for sustainability are also made affordable for with limited science and technology science and technology have served the interests of the and the political goals of apartheid this sector must confront following fragmentation and poor management of the science and lack of coordination between science councils government institutions and lack of an effective consultative process in determining skewed allocation of science and technology have an important role to play in development of all sectors of our society south economy characterised by extremely unequal distribution of therefore technology policy must address this duality and must address both the development of indigenous and exogenous science technology in order to meet the challenges of south the public sector in partnership with the private sector an indispensable role to play in technology the government will implement a programme to prioritise performance areas identify legislation requiring amendment to the integration of the science councils and establish linkages the scientific and technical priorities and rdp institutional changes will be introduced to the representativeness of all scientific the integration of all scientific councils through enabling coordination between the science and technology ministry and a national campaign for scientific and technological and training is essential together with measures aimed at the status of technical and technological the percentage of gdp generated by tourism must increase government in consultation with the industry and unions establish a policy to achieve growth as rapidly as possible on previous legislation is currently before parliament which will introduce public protector to give the public recourse to deal with and public these play a major role in the economy they are being made to highly efficient this process should continue effective use of major public resources to provide cheap and efficient services and lead in human resource development accelerated development and other innovations will be of major benefit to the chapter fiscal policy and the understandably the first questions asked regarding implementation of the rdp concern cost and in particular who will for the rdp in developing a programme to finance the rdp certain points are taken into account first most of the expenditure on rdp is not in fact new rather it is the better organisation rationalisation of existing structures that will unlock second the government at all levels will improve the capacity of financial sector to mobilise more resources and to direct these activities set out in the rdp third the government will ensure some public utilities such as electrification and are fourth improved and reformed tax systems collect more tax without having to raise tax levels as the succeeds more taxpayers will be able to contribute to fifth new funds will be raised from a number of such as donor aid interest on investments and sales of state the deficit has reached disturbingly high levels in recent and any future borrowing strategy will be based on particularly with respect to foreign loans the government is to the progressive reduction of the overall deficit the commitment to maintaining fiscal discipline rests on the belief the sustainability of the rdp will be at risk if discipline is maintained excessive government deficits will result in inflation higher real interest rates balance of payments problems lower economic growth thereby undermining the rdp given the pressure on balance of payments the impact of such deficits more immediate reducing the flexibility to redirect expenditure priority areas the borrowing strategy will avoid taking on debt for development projects that do not borrowing will be increased and rationalised projects such as housing electrification water among others which full or partial can be generated with this mind the government intends to ensure the effective management resources achieve rapid improvements in the quality of services redistribute and redirect government spending in line with the priorities of the the budgetary the budgetary process will be transparent in a manner with rdp commitments to transparency and a local provincial and national rdp structures representatives of civil society will be invited to examine budgetary process and to make recommendations on spending inefficiency waste and corruption certain changes are envisaged will enhance this at present the budget is drawn up on an incremental basis other words allocations to the different national line departments are decided on the basis of what the allocations were the previous year in time the government will introduce a budgetary process by which national line function provinces and other institutions of government will motivate programmes and on this basis determine their budgetary in addition the government will introduce a process by which budgets are drawn up for a period of three years the basis of ongoing programmes line function departments participate in the function committee which determines the allocations for a particular function the relevant standing committees are entitled to be represented on there are particular aspects of the budget process during transitional period which have implications for the rdp at provincial level for the financial year the budget began in november inputs based on old structures were received the department of state expenditure in april allocations for were therefore presented to the cabinet august provincial governments ultimately gain access to budgets of the former tbvc territories former territories and former provincial new provincial administrations will compile draft according to guideline allocations during october when cabinet approves final allocations for departments of national government will then divide the funds for those schedule functions that potentially will be claimed by the governments the final allocations for will therefore all potential provincial government functions and services provincial government funding systems will not be fully before april the total allocations to provincial governments nevertheless be voted as both conditional and unconditional provincial administrations will have to compile their own estimates presentation to their legislative bodies and citizenry administrations will also have limited powers to adopt their own a tax commission has been appointed to advise the minister finance the south african tax system will be reviewed to ensure it supports and facilitates the aims of the rdp in particular and efficiency the general level of tax as a proportion of gdp comparable with international standards however over the past the burden of tax has moved from corporations to individuals on the income group per year who now pay per of all personal tax this group consists mainly of wage earners those with private sector pensions in addition regressive forms taxation include unequal treatment of married women and indirect support will be given to the commissioner of internal revenue increase the efficiency of collection and to crack down on evasion leakage all tax incentives and exemptions should be listed and analysis carried out incentives that comply with development industrial investment human development and social policies should be subject to analysis and an explicit political decision should then be taken each all other incentives should be terminated additional collected should as far as possible not be directed to intergovernmental fiscal an important challenge facing the government is the of the new provincial administrations in particular it must effective control over current expenditure during the transition establish a more viable fiscal with regard to the former issue the national approach has been to assist provinces with administering flows through the previous structures whilst allowing the provincial administrations to be established unencumbered by financial problems of those previous structures this has continuous interaction and the rapid identification of problem and their the previous complex government structure and the de independence of the tbvc states led to a complex and intergovernmental financial situation it was possible territories and the tbvc states to incur debt deficits that eventually fell to the national government this was basis for ad hoc transfers and an increasing loss of the constitution corrects this state of affairs establishing a establishing a stable transparent and more objective system intergovernmental establishing the revenue sources of all levels of regulating borrowing and guarantees by different levels the financial and fiscal commission will begin to translate principles into more detailed concrete recommendations which result in a major structural reorganisation of intergovernmental relations closer cooperation must be built up between the and fiscal commission the commission on provincial affairs the service commission and the rdp core committee to achieve a strategy for fiscal relations which enhance the chapter public sector i one of the objectives of the rdp is to rebuild a public that will provide an excellent quality of service the public is the servant of the people and must be accessible accountable efficient and free of corruption all departments undertake reviews in order to discontinue policies programmes projects that act against the spirit of the rdp and the public employees will be redeployed in terms of rdp programmes as staffing plans are submitted to correspond to the in general the government at all levels will take steps reduce consumption expenditure while increasing capital today as a result of past policies per cent of expenditure is for remuneration initially the government will the size of the public service constant or at worst growth will contained to one per cent in but without affirmative action goals at present the rate of turnover of is about eight per cent per annum it is the intention of government not to recruit new employees for all positions that vacant it is anticipated that only about five per cent of should be the problem of disparity and the need for affirmative action be dealt with urgently through a holistic approach the present structures are very complicated and there are many ad hoc allowances present this must be rationalised to a simple based on competency rather than qualifications and it must allow clear career paths and lifetime training the ending of should then be carried out in the context of regrading of career paths recognition of prior competency development and redeployment to new priorities and enhanced programmes that are consistent with the national training strategy the national qualifications framework in addition the improvement efficiency especially at management levels and improved allocation resources must be linked to the ending of creating a broadly representative public the gnu aims not only to address disparities created apartheid but also to establish a programme which serve to stamp out racism gender inequality and other forms inequalities wherever they manifest themselves such a programme be implemented within the framework of the constitution and the need empower the disadvantaged communities with the result that other things a broadly representative public service will established all levels of government will be expected to implement policy that will ensure that the public service is representative all people of south africa in racial gender and geographical much as it is the duty of the state to create a representative service the implementation thereof will be effected in with the trade union representatives within the public sector will require fair and equitable conditions of employment to conduct at the special programmes will be designed to address of specific categories of persons at levels of the public service this process will be supplemented by promotion of the public service as a career amongst all unions in the public service have expressed a strong for these constitutional the rdp fund and public sector the major focus of the rdp fund is to reorientate the budgets all departments and institutions of the state to the new priorities the rdp departments negotiate with the rdp office for funding programmes and projects in line with the objectives of the rdp will require an assessment of the capacity to absorb recurrent costs associated with these programmes in general the staff complements in departments will not be adjusted therefore departments will redeploy personnel to meet the requirements of rdp programmes a continuous process to evaluate need for every post is required and posts which are not with the new priorities should be removed the restructuring of public service including the office of the public service is also a fundamental aim of the rdp rationalisation in the public there is a need for the rationalisation of the public service reflect a unified country the fragmentation of the public service racial entities and the many occupational categories continue to disparities which conflict with the constitution and the realisation the rdp as advanced by the gnu this will require the implementation policies to achieve departments at national provincial levels of government to serve the government of the day the people of south africa effectively the provision of service dispensations for the entire public service in terms salaries and benefits is therefore revision of existing legislation and the public service act of brought the administrations under one fold and established national a new act is required which will rationalise the administrations moreover the labour relations act consolidated the existing arrangements and a new act will be while the goal is a single unified labour relations act the interim a public service labour relations act will be to cover the entire public service such an act will also provide for public service bargaining chamber for negotiations over wages public service regulations and the public service staff code the terms and conditions of service however the revisions contain anomalies between different categories of personnel between civilian and security personnel which must be the public service commission act is being considered revision the public protector and implementation functions will separated and the department for public administration will directly to the minister provinces are being encouraged to public service commissions which will be important vehicles in rationalisation of administration however collective bargaining the setting of conditions of employment will remain subject to ratification a mechanism will be created whereby the national service commission can meet provincial commissions in order harmonise the establishment of a coherent restructured public affirmative the gnu aims not only to stamp out racism wherever it but to establish a proactive sensible affirmative action all levels of government will be expected to implement a policy affirmative action to ensure that the public service is of all the people of south africa in racial gender and terms such a policy will be negotiated with trade representatives of public sector employees fair employment codes of conduct and prohibition on racism and sexism in the are also envisaged affirmative action will only be effective if present rules governing qualifications for positions and for notches are reviewed the present rules which require qualifications and penalise applicants who have not previously access to the public service have the effect of discrimination rules based on competency are an integrated framework for affirmative action also being established so as to assist both public and private organisations this approach will extend beyond opportunities into many other aspects of including gender and geographical there are at present very many capable women in the service very few are in senior positions their promotion must be reviewed and measures implemented to correct based on the public service training the public service commission is restructuring the institute focusing on research and development training international comparative programmes modules will be developed to the needs of both the public service and the wider society critical this will be the introduction of educational programmes in management and the introduction of administrative and human rights issues so as to enhance implementation and management of the rdp will entail widening the availability of institute training so as to extend into civil society and also extending the taught so that they become transferable between the government civil society accreditation of institute training programmes occur within the context of the national qualifications it is furthermore essential that the training and retraining personnel as well as a contemporary bursary policy for the longer receive priority attention this is not only necessary to identify address the training needs of individuals in order to internalise concept of the but also to unlock the creativity the training board for local government bodies has an important role to play in respect of the training and retraining local government personnel and productivity substantial productivity gains are envisaged which will achieved through the introduction of a system of measurements the public sector unions will be consulted upon a of performance enhancing methods such as work reorganisation efficient work practices simplification of reporting removal of duplication and greater use of modern technology department will be required to prepare a report on the gains that can be made to be submitted to the department for freedom of the constitution guarantees the right to this information is a major departure from past practice precise guidelines therefore information will be available unless there is a good reason withhold information collected by government departments is fragmented and not adequate for the performance assessment monitoring nor for effective integrated planning the information management is currently under industrial sound industrial relations require strong trade unions that the confidence of their members the government will encourage extension of basic trade union rights to all its employees will be negotiated to enhance workplace democracy and chapter consultative planning in order to align public sector programmes with the goals of rdp the government will develop a vision embodied in national strategic framework the government will do this in part developing rolling national action plans through process of planning departments will be requested to national sectoral policies and plans and provinces will also provincial policies and plans a major strength of the rdp is that promotes integrated development effective implementation requires greater coordination in economic physical and planning both within the government and with key the in order to ensure broad alignment of all public programmes with the goals of the rdp an effective strategic business planning process must be established although there dangers inherent in producing inflexible long term plans the government must provide a framework to guide planning and budgetary processes it is essential that this process regularly reviews and revises the goals and priorities of the strategic and business planning process will comprise interactive cycle in this national strategic priorities will be agreed upon through consultative national strategic priorities will guide the production of all sector business monitoring mechanisms will be national action plans will be produced through a consolidating local provincial departmental and parastatal national strategic framework for the rdp and the the national strategic framework will be an in which everyone in society has a role the government will the development of the strategic framework for the financial years the framework will set parameters on what must done define intergovernmental relationships and establish utilisation of government resources key elements of the strategic framework will a policy framework for the a vision comprising strategic goals and critical and expenditure priority focus areas for the coming budgetary a full consultative process both inside and outside government will be used to mobilise all sectors in the formulation the strategic framework drafting of this framework will be through the minister without portfolio in close liaison with departments of finance and state expenditure the minister consolidate input from departments parastatals provincial and governments the private sector and civil the national strategic framework will be tabled in parliament will be revised annually to reflect weaknesses in implementation changes in the external environment the minister without will perform an annual review of progress on the basis of identified priority focus areas for the annual planning and process will include sectoral priorities geographic priorities consultation with the financial and fiscal commission gender demographic priorities and institutional and business planning on an annual basis a hierarchy of plans will be produced a process of planning from line function parastatals and provinces and coordinated during the allocation process into programmes tied to budgets these will be consolidated into a rolling action plan for the the terms of the constitution provide for development planning fall within the competency of the provincial governments will on an annual basis for the financial year develop provincial action plans in consultation with civil structures provincial action plans will detail a rolling programme and an annual business and spatial plan and cover functions within the constitutional competence of provinces and authorities to ensure structured plans aimed at equitable across the country line function departments will be responsible reaching agreement with provinces on overall targets in each sector the division of these targets between the provincial action plans should comprise an analysis the external environment and development development strategies and sectoral provincial priorities and delivery budgets and funding responsibilities allocated to the impact of proposed strategies on other provincial plans be compatible with provincial fiscal be consistent with national minimum standards for service be guided by national development support local district and metro action local government constitutes the most concrete level of annual action plans will be formally prepared for each local area in terms of an amended physical planning act which will be broadened to include all facets of with respect to annual departmental and parastatal planning national strategic framework will provide broad guidelines plans will comprise a rolling clarify funding strategies fiscal flows and audit describe sectoral and programmes and action establish key performance indicators for monitoring indicators including appropriate modifications of the nations development human development index hdi to conditions and other suitable indices will be measured and regularly the css acting together with the human sciences council hsrc will be directed to develop an hdi for south based on longevity knowledge and standard of living adjusted address both racial and gender discrimination whereas many are still to be developed a higher profile will accompany goals and upgrading of existing measures for factors such as mortality reduction in epidemics rates of adult literacy of housing employment equity in both public and sectors incidents of family violence provision of child care and the provision of infrastructure among other things assessment will be applied to the government and its institutions all levels to ensure efficiency effectiveness and development of priority intergovernmental consultation processes will ensure national provincial and local plans are consistent participation civil society will be facilitated through sectoral forums and national sectoral and provincial in line with constitutional guidelines clear distinctions be drawn between national powers and the main objectives of national are ensure that national minimum standards are maintained and to guidelines for the provision of equitable services consistent with those the government committed itself to the rdp base document each ministry and department in with the intergovernmental committees and in consultation with forums will generate guidelines on minimum standards for provision design programme targets and priority focus areas budgets and financing mechanisms formulate programme implementation delivery each province in conjunction with intergovernmental and in consultation with provincial rdp councils will produce detailed policy guidelines appropriate to local conditions policy will be generated through a consultation process designed ensure equitable and rdp the minister without portfolio will also be responsible for with departments and provinces to facilitate effective and sectoral and provincial projects which are wholly or partly funded from the rdp fund have to comply with strict controls an implementing agency a department of the government a province a local authority development trust must be appointed and it must appoint a manager each project will require a business plan which conforms to standardised format the business plan must set out agreed performance indicators procedures have been established to the drawing up of business plans in order to avoid delaying assistance with human resource and capacity development will coordinated from central and provincial government level and utilise a network formed by existing educational and institutions these procedures drawn up for the rdp projects will amended if experience shows the need to do so and will then be for all programmes of chapter consultation participation and the rdp will be implemented by the line function departments the national government by provincial and local governments and parastatals but through the widest possible consultation with participation of the citizenry of south africa structured processes at all levels of government will be introduced to participation in and planning as well as implementation the empowerment of institutions of civil society is fundamental aim of the approach to building consensus through this process the government aims to draw on creative energy of communities to facilitate effective the government will introduce programmes that will enhance the of community rdp task under the supervision of the minister without portfolio the teams will have a key advisory role in methodology methodology will draw on project experience to a large extent hence will engage in extensive local level consultation participation for example presidential projects initiated in urban renewal rural development and human resource programmes of the rdp will provide essential learning and pilot for the definition of clear urban rural and human resource policies although the technical aspects of programme management be supervised by the rdp programme supervision committee development and socioeconomic aspects will be dealt with by the development task team rural development task team and the resource development task team the task teams consist of representatives of relevant departments and provinces with experts from civil society expertise for this purpose is defined to ensure proper representation of the interests disadvantaged groups and the national economic development and labour the cabinet has taken the decision to establish the nedlc as mechanism of consultation coordination engagement and negotiation key stakeholders the structure of the nedlc will include business civics and the government while also making room for participation of a broader group of interests and organisations nedlc will include a development chamber which will bring participants from different levels of government institutions organisations of civil society organised labour and business the three other chambers are finance and monetary trade industry and effective representation by disadvantaged groups such as and rural people will require the encouragement of organisations such as stokvels producer housing electricity sectoral a variety of sectoral negotiating forums has developed participatory approach to policy formulation national line departments will be encouraged where appropriate to continue policy interaction with sectoral forums which comprise key stakeholders and technical experts forums will advise ministers on request or provincial and local to facilitate local and consultation participation provincial governments should encourage establishment of local forums which will consist representatives of all the stakeholders in the areas governments will agree on the boundaries of these in consultation with these forums local authorities will promote development of their local areas at provincial level councils should be established which consist of representatives of and sub regional forums their function will be ensure broad consultation coordination engagement and structures which in the past performed such functions will reintegrated or for effective is required in civil society to effective participation in rdp implementation through initiatives as presidential projects pathbreaking approaches to participation and local control will be explored the government cooperate with civic organisation and other organisations to develop capacity during the course of an rdp to establish local government legitimacy and hence improve both delivery and user payments development projects such as those through the npwp with a commitment labour based construction methods will also contain a far training and capacity building component with women targeted beneficiaries the public service training institute will make resources available to civil society in addition to the public increasingly organisations of civil society will be involved planning and through a variety of boards forums and other venues by which experience is gained and skills acquired the new approach to freedom of public information will play an enhancing role in the particular roles of ngos are worth more consideration ngos proliferated during the years of apartheid they took over many roles of planning education policy and support which a democratic government would normally have in addition they provided support for the democratic forces resources of the apartheid state were denied to them since almost governments refused to supply aid to the apartheid state most aid channelled through the government especially at local and provincial levels now carry out these functions as part of its normal operations includes the normalisation of the development finance relationship primarily an function further the resources of government especially in the area of research must be made to mass organisations as they are to business and other a human resource and capacity development has been established the national government to facilitate and coordinate rdp provincial and local governments are the key areas of delivery of rdp the task teams will therefore focus initially on the of the ability of the public service and of communities at and local level to drive the programme planning implementation management required for the rdp programmes effectively as far possible existing institutions will be utilised a of institutions including universities technikons technical teacher training colleges private and public sector facilities the public service training institute and some ngos envisaged this network will be challenged to provide the training in modular form and consistent with the qualifications framework and the national training strategy in to respond to this challenge institutions will be encouraged to the process of reforming themselves provincial and local task will be essential in order to stimulate and develop integration coordination of the future government support for ngos will be based on their role taking forward the rdp a process that can be assisted and through some form of accreditation for all such ngos which government funds rationalisation of service delivery to communities a general guideline for donors however it is both necessary desirable for healthy efficient and effective development organisations and ngos to exist the government should have a monopoly of resources in this area organisations of society should continue to have the choice of access to sources of services such as policy research so that it is completely dependent on the government in addition development organisations will receive more extensive financial logistical support once representativeness accountability effectiveness are the government must ensure that its service arms are to civil society especially mass organisations with limited and that they are able to provide an unbiased service even in such as industrial strategy development planning or other areas multipartite negotiation where interests may be opposed to government policies ngos can and should therefore provide a benchmark for quality against which the government or institutions can be measured the government strongly favours establishment of a coordinating body for ngos this body should constituted as far as possible from the rationalisation of bodies and should be substantially independent of the government government should be sympathetic to it and should not interfere in activities except through regular consultation in order to coherent development with respect to organisations of civil society especially the labour movement and the civics their role in establishment of political democracy was central they have also very substantial improvements in the social and economic lives of constituents a vibrant and independent civil society is essential the democratisation of our society which is envisaged by the organisations will exercise essential checks and balances the power of the government to act unilaterally without corruptly or the rdp envisages a social partnership and the government therefore provide services and support to all sectors organised labour the civics business groups and religious and cultural bodies moreover the government has a duty terms of the rdp to encourage independent organisation where they not exist such as rural areas strong consumer and movements are essential in a modern industrial society and should facilitated by the the government must therefore provide resources in an open transparent manner and in compliance with clear and explicit to mass organisations to ensure that they are able to develop maintain the ability to participate effectively as negotiating of the government the social partnership envisaged by the rdp not however imply that mass organisations do not retain the right their own interpretation of and their own goals for the rdp it imply that there is agreement to find solutions to constraints will emerge in the implementation for example if industry bottlenecks are identified as constraints to efforts to reach housing targets the relevant organisations institutions will be encouraged to reach consensus on solutions address the specific bottlenecks or shortages that are identified a series of agreements or accords will be negotiated to facilitate full participation of civil society together with the government order to find ways to take down the barriers which emerge during course of the empowerment of women youth rural and disabled the government has completed a report on women in south africa preparation for the united nations conference in beijing on the of women next year the rdp office has been mandated to spearhead broader empowerment programme for women taking into account that often represent the poorest most exploited and most sector of our as described elsewhere in this document the government formulate an integrated and sustainable rural development policy consultation with rural people their organisations and in particular attention will be given to broaden access to and support to agricultural producers by ensuring access land appropriate markets credit facilities training and the capacity to implement development programmes in rural areas is serious bottleneck which will be addressed as a the government will design in consultation with disabled a comprehensive programme for the disabled which will enhance mobility in society and remove discriminatory practices against especially in the work place government will also discuss means reintegrate disabled people into their communities especially who are mentally disabled where people are entitled to grants these should be paid to them special attention will be to mental illness arising from trauma and violence which can people from being able to function normally in the youth of our land played a major role in the achievement freedom the government will consider establishing special aimed at addressing the needs of young people in particular address the backlog in education and training job creation recreation young people are our most important effort will be required to ensure that they are equipped to play major role in the reconstruction and development of south chapter conclusion a national this first white paper on reconstruction and development has set key change management strategies for transformation particular government at all levels it also sets out guidelines on areas particular importance for change this is the first in a series second will be published for comment in march and will set out more detail specific policies together with an evaluation of daunting challenges face government in implementing the programme out in this paper perhaps the most crucial is the establishment credible and effective local government in both urban and rural without this implementation of development programmes will seriously hindered it will require a sustained and intensive which brings together central government provincial existing local authorities civics trade unions business and community organisations local government development will also a huge effort in human recourse and capacity development institutions will be challenged to provide this input in a the stability of local government services depends on the payment of user charges the first step in achieving this is to all aspects of local government finances completely open transparent this must be done also with the finances and structures of both municipal and national further planning of a campaign to restore stability to local finances must be done together with mass organisations and with trade unions active in local the campaign will only be successful if government at all levels prepared to go out to the people to talk clarify and explain and answer the issue of affordable tariffs targeted subsidies and welfare delivery must be resolved as a matter of communities must be prepared to commit themselves to contracts in terms of which they undertake to participate in planning management and protection of development there is a second major challenge in implementing the programme for the rdp to be there must be a civil society however there is a tendency at present to believe government will deliver on its this has the potential disempower the organisations of civil society communities organisations are listing projects and expecting the government to over a cheque rather organisations and communities should set up projects and expect the government to cooperate not to the government must proactively assist civil society to gain access information and to participate effectively in the required for a rdp equally civil society must that the resources of local and provincial governments are and the third major challenge is to ensure that the change process in government moves sufficiently rapidly to allow changes in the deployment of staff and expenditure before the budget march this must include changes in budgeting procedures and management of programmes and asset the responsibility for the renewal and transformation of our nation however not the responsibility only of the government nor particular elected officials it is a joint responsibility of sections of our nation and calls on all to put their energy creativity into finding ways of doing things better and the constraints and obstacles which can prevent delivery of a life for all of our people can be solved if those constituencies involved in a sector apply their minds to the problem this partnership and national consensus does not mean that constituencies and organisations of civil society cannot or should have their own aims and goals it does however mean that they attempt to make those aims and goals consistent with the aims of rdp and of renewal of our society in a conscious and honest it is essential that organisations of civil society do in fact clear goals which reflect the real interests of their members but should lead their members in attempting to align those goals with in this way the energy of the nation can be harnessed for the good lead projects

routing scheduling optimisation as you can gather from our previous blog post we have announced our first challenge we are very excited to have leading on board as our first challenge tim klem the vp of transport logistics at redmart announced challenge at our first capacity building workshop on august the most interesting aspect of this challenge is that it centers the broad theme of urban planning but also has a narrow more focus on capacity optimization for redmart being an one the main concerns is managing its transport systems logistics by optimizing routing and schedules a pressing they face is with limited number of trucks how can redmart allocate its resources in a sustainable way to ensure timely to customers redmart believes that cleverly deploying resources around their current limitations presents many for their this brings us back to the first dextra challenge a hybrid combines the elements of both customer persuadability optimisation the challenge proposes the creation a model that generates the most efficient x changes to delivery times given a data set consisting of customer orders and fixed routing algorithm x is the number of changes on any given day eg changes per efficiency is measured by routing calculation driving minutes and driving distance for the whole delivery time changes must be within the same day and all order details basket contents routing algorithm can be any technology chosen by viamente quantum for this challenge slated to go live on the dextra platform redmart will be providing some very interesting insightful data sets on delivery times customer orders etc to will add our own data on transport weather and urban we will be letting out more information on this challenge so do our blog for more catch the presentation of

career in general management her long term career plans are specific malvina would like to have a career in consulting banking or wealth management at a large her first contact with the energy world was the nrg battle the energy sector malvina remarks that the growing demand energy and resources due to population growth is the challenge our planet is facing she proposes that out of the thinking coupled with innovations in the renewables realm help solve the energy demand population growth problem wish to develop herself and build a more comprehensive base which will benefit me as a future business leader drove to participate in the battle she sees the nrg battle as a and fun experience and the chance to develop herself personally professionally her case focused on constructing small scale wind turbines that included solar cells and could be above houses in the urban areas fitting with her multi status role in the team was combination of generator strategic thinker leader and team to be honest i never expected that the ideas developed during nrg battle stood a chance to get implemented but now participating in two battles nrg europe and world edition i only feel naive about my it is purely scientific durgesh team team gasunie dnv study master in chemical engineering at delft university talent efficiency as chemical engineer durgesh was selected by dnv the world edition in kuala lumpur in to work on challenge power to gas in he already won the huntsman challenge with an innovative idea on how to save million euro year in producing polyurethanes durgesh is identified as a team player he handles the stress of world competitions very in a very efficient and analytical way he helped his nrg team mates to structure their ideas he loves to analyse and experiment with improving systems with the right data his is to rationally explain intriguing observations and use them developing advanced currently durgesh is pursuing his phd by researching fundamentals of polymer flows through porous which has application in enhanced oil recovery durgesh is passionate his research and is thinking about a career as a scientist academia or industry his first connection to the energy sector after his bachelor at his first real job at kongsberg oil gas technologies for the energy sector the engineer identifies two major challenges how do we bridge the between the fossil fuel economy and the renewable fuel and how to prevent large developing economies bric countries wasting energy and raise their energy efficiency at a standard for solutions to the the twofold problem durgesh to first continue with funding for prolonging the production fossil fuels and second demonstrate benefits of efficiency together with sharing knowledge and technology on global level to enable efficient use of energy countries as personal contribution to the energy sector the candidate feels that his current research is how he can best the the indian born chemical engineer says he was driven to take in the nrg battle by the possibility to network and obtain holistic picture of the energy experience the battle was quite surprising to be honest i never that the ideas developed during the nrg battle stand a chance get implemented but now after participating in two battles europe and world edition i can only feel naive about my the nrg battle participant saw that companies enthusiastic about using young talents to solve energy in the latest nrg battle contest the european finals durgesh was idea generator for his team he also charge of the technical details of the case his team did a good job in finding a solution for repurposing old plants in north sea and won third place in nrg battle europe edition the transition to an increasing amount of renewables is one of key reasons i am excited to build my career in energy sector it such a complex excellence is doing the ordinary extraordinarily sarah team team study masters in sustainable development at the talent sarah hill is currently studying for her degree sustainable development the energy and resources track at university she is a unique combination of management entrepreneurial talent and strategic talent being a sarah can not only see future possibilities but can also focus facts she is driven by innovation efficiency and my first contact with the energy sector was in the beginning of second year of my during my time as students in free enterprise sife now enactus i participated nationwide leadership training this is where i met a number inspiring and enthusiastic professionals from the remarks she believes that energy security and potential tensions are two of the challenges that the energy field is at the moment for the challenge of energy security the strategies seem to be already underway eg diversification suppliers of energy resources and type of energy would also suggest country specific solutions or clusters countries combining efforts to insure greater security of the transition to an increasing amount of renewables is one of key reasons i am excited to build my career in energy sector it such a complex challenge says this was the first time sarah took part in the nrg battle she quite delighted with the experience and deems it as a good for her future career in the energy field upon finding out the nrg battle i thought the cases would present similar types challenges i may face in my professional career additionally was excited by the idea of working towards practical and commercial solutions for a challenge in the sector the competition was a challenging energizing and rewarding where i had the pleasure of working on a complex energy case in team with four other excellent students my role within the was predominately an organizer strategic i am becoming old and look back i want to say that achieved everything i could and wanted to i am goal oriented these goals keep me going and motivate me also the pride of family makes me stronger and makes me accept new never give up and believe in lena team team study international business and talent efficiency lena is very focussed and strongly driven she is hard working dedicated woman that loves to improve things what explains interest in logistics her analytical and structured assures you to get the facts straight and detailed plans easy not an option for lena she strives for more and better am becoming old and look back i want to say that i everything i could and wanted to i am goal oriented and goals keep me going and motivate me also the pride of my makes me stronger and makes me accept new currently lena is a fourth year student of international and management at the hanze university of applied sciences groningen she will graduate with in february lena spent year in hong kong and experienced a variety of cultures improved her language skills after graduating she would like start her master in the field of logistics being accepted into honours talent program she started a project called kenya the aim of this project is to help the people in mombasa creating an for a nursery school and english math and lena her parents played a significant role in her descion making i would say everything started with my mum and dad who have own consultancy company they showed me the business world what can achieve and how i can make a difference to the world it stunning and therefore i decided to apply for the apprenticeship an industrial clerk at a mineral oil company in germany this time i run through the different departments participated project work and also selected the new apprentices furthermore got an insight into the refinery for two weeks i am still thankful for for years lena was part of this and realised that the oil and gas fields will not last especially due to fierce competition and shrinking energy especially the security of energy supply a lot of such as solar panels and windmills are available but so far we not able to use them in the most efficient lena sees working at top level for a logistics or energy company but over the consultancy company of her parents is also an lena applied for the nrg battle and got chosen by eon her had to reduce the energy usage of a building complex with cooperative solar panel system in nijmegen by within a of lena and her team invented three ideas of which implementation of a vortex hydro energy system water flows around cylinders inducing transverse motion was most innovative part of their solution after the battle the team was invited by eon for a company visit in rotterdam to how this enterprise is working and which contribution they make a more sustainable industry the time pressure and the strain the competition were amazing factors of this challenge and me that i am able to handle that it is amazing to see that participating companies look for ambitious students to solve energy challenges and let the talents be part of the change i am passionate about overcoming business related obstacles in the modern and developing world i want to contribute my potential to making a difference in the world i live in optimizing it for future live each day as if it is your last but if it is not your be sure that it positively contributes to the michael team team assen sensor study bachelor international business and talent management michael is driven by efficiency and a structured worker and improving things is what he aims for he is also result driven action minded and focussed on reaching short targets these two strong drives make him a management combining his analytical and critical thinking with fast making skills assuring that things get done michael international business and management at the hanze university applied sciences in groningen the netherlands after first year study results he was accepted into the honours program michael grew up in burlington ontario canada completed his education with a year fire protection technology diploma and gained many engineering related skills this specialized field of fire sciences his family is in the netherlands what makes him a dual citizen holding both canadian and dutch he participated in volunteer opportunities to aid communities dominican republic mexico zambia and rural kentucky states i am passionate about overcoming business obstacles both in the modern and developing world i want contribute my full potential to making a difference in the world live in and optimizing it for future generations this summer will lead a team of honnours students to go to mombasa and help the local fire department orphanages and schools to business related his first real contact with the energy sector was during a lecture by a representative of gasterra in from that forward he became much more conscious of the developments challenges in the energy sector and the importance of not innovation in the industry but also the necessity for change the global approach to sustainable energy according to michael of the biggest challenges in the energy sector at this moment consumer acceptance of truly sustainable energy regardless of cost one of the solutions that he proposes is community engagement in the energy sector to truly understanding and acceptance of sacrifices that must be michael saw the nrg battle as an excellent opportunity to his knowledge and experience in the energy sector the nrg experience exceeded my expectations although i was briefly of what to expect i was surprised by the passion and displayed by participants i enjoyed engaging myself in a real case and understanding practical issues in the energy sector would like to emphasize the pleasure i experienced as a in the nrg battle i really support such an initiative of engagement into practical energy related being a member of the assen sensor city team they were asked invent a product with commercial potential that helps consumers decide on changing their behavior regarding energy consumption that simultaneously improves their comfort level the team included combining the assen sensor technology infrastructure consumer goods and transit consumption data to create a rewards program the rewards points would be collected on a card and would be redeemable for an array of goods and such as education health care and community activities one the drawbacks to their solution is related to privacy law but see this as only a minor obstacle to overcome and present a pitch in the finals of the nrg battle in november resources on earth are not infinite but distributed and companies have to step up to another level of be efficient and unordinary in your kostiantyn team spirit study master energy and environmental talent strategic konstiantyn is an ecology and innovation driven engineer excellent technical background he wants to design and new infrastructures and energy projects around the world curiosity and broad interest make him innovation driven he has structured and analytical way of working these combined drives innovation and efficiency make him into a unique strategic strategic talents combine the competing values of foreseeing trends and developments with the value of focussing on todays and figures at the same time this will result in calculated and controlled innovation my goal is to be a part of teams create amazingly and important projects like intercontinental grids or subarctic konstiantyn believes that in several decades many jobs will replaced by artificial intelligence and robots but there always be space for people who are fascinated by their work this rapidly changing world you should never stop yourself and your he got his bachelor degree in electrical engineering in technical university of ukraine and did several internships in corporation and institute for renewable energy in ukraine he got his first insights to energy sector he worked as engineer for a solar company in ukraine and cooperated with a of interesting people not only from international companies also from the government this cooperation gave him an new vision on the energy sector different from what he studying at the university the solar market has many people who are willing to make the world a better place to in he feels that the measure of success in his career equals value of responsibilities and importance of his projets being an important sector that of energy with the responsibility for design important and pv systems in ukraine was good career konstiantyn is now doing two masters one in ukraine and one in netherlands at the university of groningen to step up featureless resource that powers life to the factor that will change the way we live and consume to sustainable is the biggest challenge of the sector konstiantyn on a level the main challenge is the cooperation between countries resources of earth are not but distributed that is why countries and companies have to up to another level of integration and create shared transmission systems and markets on a planet scale decentralization monitoring resource based adequate pricing of conventional fossil fuels is the nrg battle gave konstiantyn the opportunity to meet from energy sector and to spend time with other smart people in creative atmosphere spirit it challenged them about pricing and taxation of natural resources by using front measurement equipment and analytical software and guarantee implementation of polluter pays his team suggested the implementation of a smart data system that will be able to allocate the environmental ratio of electricity produced from different energy sources different technologies this will provide customers with and appropriate data about the environmental damage that is during production their idea will create a background for development of renewables and will force producers of to limit their damage to the nrg battle was a very special experience and it was good to able to work together with companies and working hard pays annemarth team spirit study master environment and resources management and business talent innovation annemarth is an enthusiastic hard worker not only in her but also in sports she finished the ringvaart regatta a rowing marathon with a boat of four battling with the wind rain and through team effort her team worked hard and reached finish annemarth is not only a great teamplayer she is innovatively driven as can been seen in her broad interest knowledge of different relevant topics energy value chains and extracurricular activities ranging from committees to volunteering working in peru and fundraising for her ambitions have driven her far and she will soon receive degree of science in both business administration and environment resource management annemarth started business mathematics and it business analytics at the amsterdam her talent is her curiosity her desire for change interest in new ideas her analytical and mathematical skills ideas into realistic plans she loves to assess whether ideas really viable and worthwhile to invest annemarth feels that combining two masters environment resource management and transport and supply chain management perfect combination in sustainability driven meanwhile she is completing two seperate graduate internships of them will allow her to travel to tanzania for two and a months to perform market research on solar energy in tanzania agencynl the other internship is at fmcg company where she on supply chain management annemarth feels that the energy is held back by conservative views and the step towards energy is still too difficult or expensive she just performed study on offshore wind in sweden and found it will only be if the state she learned that some techniques like offshore wind are still the beginning of the learning curve it will take another couple years before this becomes interesting for companies to invest this is where the state could come in and help for the the annemarth wanted to participate in the nrg battle to be able work on cases a thing she missed during her studies was part of team spirit it and was asked how to use measurement systems to raise awareness in the energy sector team came up with a system that measures the energy outputs in real time making it possible for the consumers not to choose between grey and green energy but also between scales of polluters an important factor because energy have often already signed contract for years and will switch to green energy during this period nrg battle was very special experience and it was good to be able to work with companies and students from different disciplines there was lot of creativity going my mission is to improve upon the energy situation in ghana africa and that of the believing in oneself and trusting god is the key to nutifafa yao team team rosen study msc topmaster in nanoscience at the zernike institute advanced materials ziam university of talent leadership edmond was selected by

netherlands regarding career goals edmond would like become part time lecturer and researcher and part inspirational speaker additionally he states my mission is improve upon the energy situation in ghana thus africa and that the world with this in mind the talent touches upon the need educating all members of society irrespective of their status educational regarding his encounter with the energy sector edmond notes his first real contact with this field was in when he involved in a discussion about ghana deciding to go solutions for the problems the energy sector is facing he more attention to renewables especially to applications of solar cells and their potential for being cheap energy sources thesis on bulk heterojunction solar cells and his collaboration the new research project on photovoltaic cells photosystem i at ziam are ways in which he is contributing to this part of the energy about his experience at the nrg battle edmond states i can it was a wonderful one what was intriguing for the solar aficionado was the passion the talent the brilliant ideas the dedication of all candidates inspiring to know people from all educational backgrounds are getting involved energy an enormous savings potential lies in the energy renovation of i believe that when you do things that you really success nathalie team team siemens study in european construction management at university of talent with interests like horse riding exploring new cultures strategic consultancy it is no wonder that nathalie kerstens is nathalie is a management talent which enables her be efficient and result driven she is also an talent which allows her to have both vision for the future drive to succeed in reaching goals last but not nathalie is a strategic talent the rare combination of drive and innovation nathalie is currently pursuing her degree in management and engineering cme at eindhoven university technology her interest in such a study programme was by her wish to have a broader view on the construction world to understand the underlying processes better as nathalie it she is also involved in several extracurricular activities chairwoman of the study association and by active in the board of the horse riding association esrv her first significant contact with the energy field was during thesis to obtain my degree for building engineer my graduation thesis was about thermal renovation projects given the large amount insufficiently insulated homes and the fact that total energy of residential heating represents a very large proportion of total energy use an enormous savings potential lies in the efficient renovation of homes remarks nathalie in view the biggest challenge the energy sector is facing at moment is to make sure there are enough clean energy sources provide the world with electricity everybody likes green but no one wants a wind turbine in their backyard maybe the key to keep it small and simple like neighbourhoods with houses with high level of insulation to limit the energy use and an electricity generation plant that works on solar power wind water the nrg battle is the place where talented people like gather to fins solution for pressing energy related nathalie comments on her experience with the nrg battle it was enriching experience it was really fun to work with people different universities and faculties and to incorporate all visions into one case our case already provided a solution and gave a vision on how implementation was feasible and explained needs for the different stakeholders the biggest challenge in the energy field is completing the cycle from fundamental research towards implementation in reaching your goals gives you great piet team team study in nanoscience at the university of talent entrepreneurial piet driest has always been interested in science even as a kid knew he would like to be in academia in kindergarten as a year old when i was asked what i wanted to be when i was older answered says piet with a chemistry a in nanoscience a passion for skiing and keen interest in solar cells piet has a bright future ahead him piet is also an entrepreneurial talent hence he is able see possibilities in the energy market and has the sense to quickly on i have had some good influences from my parents and my thesis professor notes the top talent piet plans to steer career towards the academic world and he has a good reason for after graduation first of all i would like to do a phd in my field you need to have a phd afterwards i will either my dream as a kid and become a professor or i might use knowledge to start my own company or work for a company in field says his first contact with the energy sector was during his study where his interest in solar cells sparked i took a courses and solar cells grabbed my attention explains discussing the current challenges in the energy field stresses the importance of communication the biggest challenge the energy field is completing the full cycle from research towards implementation in society the between the players in this field is in most cases very piet participated in the latest nrg battle european edition was quite pleased with the experience i think the battle is great way to bring together students and companies from disciplines and let them see and solve cases from perspectives that was my reason for joining my own team came with a very nice suiting solution for the case we were given my role in the team was to be the creative spark trying to everybody thinking out of the box says the current large fossil fuel companies have to make a slowly i think they are having difficulty with having a too transition i am sure they want to be co neutral but they stay cheerful and enjoy ilja team team fujifilm study in civil engineering and management at university of talent inspiring ilja kamphuis is an inspiring talent he is a team driven innovation driven individual combining with desire to share his ideas with others ilja can inspire people new and exciting ideas and in his case these ideas might be the field of water engineering which he is enthusiastic ilja is currently studying for his degree in engineering and management track water engineering and at the university of apart from being quite dedicated to his studies iljla has engaged in various extracurricular activities over the before starting university he went to thailand for a year where lived with a host family in bangkok and studied at a during his university years ilja became active in rowing club i was training six days per week and competed in races against other universities says the nrg battle was first real contact with the field energy his university was advertising the nrg battle and some the cases were about water and blue energy hence ilja interested and decided to participate in the competition the battle experience was a chance for him to expose his thinking of the box organizational skills in order to help his team advised them to approach their case in the competition by using parallel thinking technique called the six thinking hats and worked because team is in the nrg battle according to ilja the challenges that the energy field is at the moment come from fossil fuels use the current large fuel companies have to make a transition slowly i think they having difficulty with having a too fast transition i am sure want to be co neutral but they need time there are so different kinds of clean energy water solar nuclear wind the challenge is what type of energy should we use should we use all of them or a small selection remarks at the moment we have the technology but we i strongly believe that everything is esther team team study master energy science at utrecht talent entrepreneurial esther eggink is an inspiring entrepreneurial talent she is driven innovative and this makes her fit for good leader she started her studies with a bachelor management including an exchange programme at the university currently she studies the master energy science utrecht university i am energetic ambitious and always for a i did my bachelor innovation management in utrecht where i took energy track that is where i first started looking at the sector as green and innovative instead of grey and boring is a very energetic person she is ambitious and venturous believe everything is possible i am dedicated to awake the stop talking start innovating speed up the transition renewable energy in my study energy science at utrecht i studied the solutions for the energy problems and in my full board year of aiesec i learned how to use the people around me implement according to esther the biggest challenge for the energy sector the dialog between the government the sector and the citizens the moment we have the technology but we communicate we want to be sustainable but the funny thing is that happening yet companies have the money the government has guidelines and the utility companies have to provide these are not being brought together we need people who are willing take the initiative who have a passion for this dialog like esther sees herself as the connecting part i took part in the battle world edition in kuala lumpur i noticed that my role the team was to connect the dots when you keep everything yourself you cannot innovate in the european battle she was of team siemens our case was to design a mobile charging unit electric cars we designed one which uses only renewable energy can be used as marketing tool as we are encouraged by our dreams and the will to be ambitious in positive energy sector as a platform for human beatriz team team study master philosophy in engineering for development in talent leadership beatriz fernandez obtained her chemical engineering degree monterrey institute of technology and higher education tec monterrey in mexico at the moment she pursues her master in philosophy in engineering for sustainable development at university of cambridge beatriz is a leadership talent which she is result driven and has passion for the team i am outgoing person and persistent when accomplishing my goals my first contact with the energy sector in while doing student internship for the energy department of cemex cement company in switzerland after this enriching experience once graduated from university beatriz had the opportunity to for almost three years in texas usa for one of the engineering design firms i was involved in developing projects oil and gas companies this made me aware of the challenges that will face in the near future and the need to be prepared to the energy sector represents a platform for human this sector will face the question of how to approach the challenges from a holistic point of view where economic are not anymore the only drivers but also the social environmental aspects must be considered the hard part innovating is the fear to leave our comfort zone to explore areas that may or may not lead us to better scenarios however are encouraged by our dreams and the will to be ambitious in positive beatriz joined the nrg battle for team siemens my team designed charging mobile unit that generates its own power with fuel cells the competition was an amazing experience the battle is a great forum to expose students to apply their and experience into real projects we have had the chance to about this sector in our universities but getting hands on it innovation is about connecting the jack of all trades and master of tarunjot team team study master material science in talent tarunjot singh is a master student in material science in germany currently pursuing his thesis to develop work function emitter after completing his degree in metallurgical engineering in he worked as engineer at a steel plant tarunjot is a he innovative result driven and efficient with him is an inspiration i like to consider myself a jack all trades and a master of over the years my projects as an undergraduate engineer or now a masters student have been involved in developing new the objective at the end has always been to develop a material a more energy efficient vehicle for energy hydrogen purposes or for the reactor walls and so on even while working a business analyst and conducting secondary research into industries the energy sector was always something that caught interest owing to the challenges involved and the quest for a more sustainable tarunjot looks at a promising future not only for himself but for the sector the extensive research going on in the field renewables efficient energy storage smart grids and so on promising and is bound to change the future of energy in a way he competed at the nrg battle in team gasterra their dealt about how can be a part of the global solution and goals our solution was to switch to resources using the existing infrastructure at the time and minimizing the transportation costs and emissions one of the key elements of the nrg battle is innovation and his team made it to the finals because their idea was innovative i feel no book or a course for actually helps to innovate innovation lies within and one explore it by being observant and receptive to and ideas it is about connecting the nrg battle is a great opportunity to see many facets of the energy industry and to come into contact with it is purely scientific curiosity yea chyn team gasunie dnv study master in business administration specialization organizational and management control at the university talent strategic yea chyn was selected for the nrg battle europe edition made it to the finals with team gasunie dnv kema her and accounting expertise and innovative mind make her a talented lady she has a unique combination of an personality connecting the dots in future developments and at same time a very efficient and analytical mind making her into strategic talent she can foresee future developments in and is focused on risk management in a team yea chyn is in of the analytics and will come up with new ideas at the same only a talented person can handle these competing as of september yea chyn will have officially recevied msc ba in organizaional and management control from the of groningen and is currently looking for a job that is for her her greatest career aspiration is to inspire generations for many generations people have been wasting talents and in some way i want to stimulate these people to use of their gifts for the better good of society and generations says the ambitious yea first contact with the energy sector was the she did at nv nederlandse gasunie in after the experience she stayed in touch with the industry by energy related conventions participating in various events the nrg battle or cracking cases for the energy delta yea interest was sparked by the dynamic energy which according to her has to overcome many challenges of challenges the nrg battle participant identifies security supply of energy finding new sustainable sources of energy and transition process of current energy companies to be able operate in this as the main issues of the sector yea chyn is convinced that making investments rather cutting back is going to help the energy sector tackle she participated in the nrg battle through the same means she in touch with the energy sector her internship at gasunie chyn also has an interest in working alongside other students with different backgrounds and she had a great experience at the battle met a lot of people and learnt a lot from them for yea chyn the nrg battle a great opportunity to see many representative facets of the industry and to come into contact with related companies in finals of the nrg battle europe edition her role in team was not surprisingly mediator and strategic my expertise lies more in the bridge between science management control the system rather than sabotaging kendall team team study master energy science in talent kendall esmeijer finished his bachelor innovation management for his studies he traveled to south korea where he a minor in business administration now he enters his second in the master energy science at utrecht university kendall is he is result driven efficient innovative i am always looking for new adventures things to to me the energy sector is intriguing our society is so on energy and people often have no idea how much energy consume if governmental policy would facilitate innovation in energy sector we could take huge steps towards energy and also increase domestic employment this would benefit as a whole kendall is an ambitious person at the moment more interested in exploring the scientific background of renewable energy options during the final part of my however come to know that my expertise lies more on the between science and management and i therefore do not see becoming a kendall attended the nrg battle with team alliander our case to make houses fit for decentralized energy production and we came up with a creative power to gas solution to store energy in balloons above your house team impressed jury with their fun and innovative twist and are headed to finals at the end of november power to gas is a great concept it has its limitations our group was comprised of students different disciplines and we therefore had a broad knowledgebase our disposal i believe this gave us a competitive advantage got us through to the the future of the energy sector to me is promising because of increasing demand for and depletion of natural resources i that the resulting rise in energy prices will make people aware of their consumption this will give room for energy players to sell their ideas and products and gain share kendall has always cared for the environment i see necessity of sustainable resource extraction and however more of a realist and try to assess the feasibility certain technological implementations taking into account demand and societal preference instead of blindly choosing for most environmentally friendly options we need to steer towards system rather than sabotaging i want to use my knowledge about sustainable energy to make energy transition waste jonas team team friesland study master of science in theoretical physics with concentration on sustainable energy and talent leadership jonas has a natural way of leading a group to achieving results a team leader during the g youth forum in st petersburg learned about the dos and of working in an team also his experience in the edition of honours summer school has also contributed to development of his leadership talent nrg battle consisted of students from india mexico greece and netherlands with jonas leading the team they were able to out a great idea and make it to the finals in november passion revolves around supporting coaching and training others the energy currently the talent is pursuing his degree in with a concentration in sustainable energy and processes jonas hopes to end up in energy consultancy and means many different things but the most important aspect is he wants to use his knowledge about sustainable energy economical and societal to make the energy transition happen is already working towards this by establishing a teaching for high school students this module is called lesmodule energiecrisis httpaddr and aims to teach about the theoretical and the practical aspects of the transition in collaboration with the vu university he is working on making an online teaching module about the transition which will hopefully be used in the curriculum of high as soon as he realized that an energy transition directed away fossil fuels could prevent runaway climate change he interested in the energy sector jonas considers making aware of the possible consequences of our current consumption and production to be the biggest challenge for energy sector he believes we need to make our society aware of already available technology to make this transition a therefore the solution jonas proposes seems rather simple theory sound energy education beginning in primary school high school students should learn all about the basics of have a good sense of scale and most importantly develop a mindset jonas will start by developing teaching materials students but in the long run he plans to be an energy for either businesses or overall the nrg battle was a challenging and enjoyable for jonas as he acted as the team moderator he engaged players thus enabling successful intercultural team his team worked on reducing energy loss in the process of milk powder their solution was to reuse as much exhaust heat possible by creating a filter that dries air without cooling down too much talk about the person who discovers a revolutionary way to store energy renewable sources energy will be awarded a nobel prize if you want to achieve something do not keep it to yourself everybody you know and you will gijs team team study master in environmental and natural resource talent multi talent with a focus on multi talents such as gijs are unique and have their own way approaching diverse situations they combine their drive results with innovation and great team spirit leading to the efficient way of approaching projects multi talents do not trends they set them in their own unique way for this own personal story is also unique he pursued his master environmental and natural resource economics in denmark combined his education with a student job at ap moller maersk a conglomerate in shipping and energy he chose to go there denmark is far ahead of its neighbours when it comes to energy after finishing his study he realized he never touched a wind turbine had never driven an electric car had smelled biodiesel in order to do so he participated in to cape a month cycling journey to explore the future renewable the cape to cape adventure gave gijs the opportunity to with renewable energy professionals and the chance to given workshops on renewable energy while inspiring individuals to on a sustainable future gijs is currently working for zonline mission is to place solar panels on every single roof the netherlands at the same time gijs is exploring entrepreneurial world of renewable energy as he is starting his company named under yott gijs will be giving to engage young generations to discuss our energy future likes to put his creativity to work and he wants to see results his career he hopes to contribute to accelerating progress a future based on renewable energy after establishing himself an entrepreneur in europe gijs hopes to pursue other in malawi or tanzania where he can further develop his and interest for the energy sector emerged at the end of school he wrote his profile assignment on the hydrogen for him at the moment the greatest challenge for the sector is surely the issue of storage of electricity renewables i have no doubt that the prices of produced from renewable sources will fall far below the prices electricity produced using fossil fuels the person who discovers revolutionary way to store this energy will be awarded a prize his solution to speed up the transition towards a sustainable future based on renewable energy usage is to educate the public in order to engage them to create during the nrg battle gijs acted as a process facilitator for team he structured the ideas he and his team put forth in order meet their nrg battle goal winning the competition his throughout the battle allowed him to become acquainted with team all interested and excited to change the of honest feedback and open communication can take results to higher feeling the boost when expanding beyond my comfort zone drives to stay hester team team study master industrial talent management and leadership hester is currently a student of the multidisciplinary programme in industrial ecology and simultaneously board member the delft energy club her naturally occurring leadership management skills allow hester to consistently improve team from her position of external commissioner on the board of delft energy club she is able to have a large overview of the opportunities in the continuously changing energy sector hester ambitious and passionate about developing her personal skills achieving something great her enthusiasm is contagious and believes that you should never be afraid of receiving and constructive criticism according to hester honest feedback open communication can take results to a higher when career plans are concerned hester would like to be part of ambitious and high performing team that works on tackling challenges in the energy sector she looks forward to herself to a company in which she will have the opportunity to on national and international projects and to develop her so that she would be a significant member in that hester was introduced to the energy sector in the first year of programme her focus was directed towards energy due her involvement in cype the csp young engineering platform europe and by attending energy related events like the young engineers conference in for hester one of the challenges the energy sector is facing today is to realize sustainable energy sector while dealing with interdependency among countries regarding politics resources economics in order to overcome these issues hester believes the stimulation of initiatives because the are too large to be tackled solely by large hopes that her role in the energy sector will be to identify bridge the gaps in order to accelerate technological social environmental developments needed to realize renewable the nrg battle was a pleasant experience for hester it was to join the nrg battle one of all these amazing events that organized nowadays to stimulate the generation of innovative that should tackle future challenges of the energy hester believes that the battle is not only important generating ideas but also for increasing awareness about challenges that companies in the energy sector are energy companies can change their core business from generation toward a more service oriented approach offering human capacity and i deeply feel the urge to critically unravel and analyze issues order to truly understand aagje van team team study master energy and environmental talent leadership aagje is always looking to bring knowledge into action during bachelor in ecology she realized that becoming an ecologist never satisfy her urge to find solutions or strategies to deal the complex problems that the energy sector is facing she chose to start a more applied study in which could learn not only about the environmental aspects of the market but also about the economical and political aspects has a approach mindset and tries to implement idealistic thoughts in a positive and proactive manner during nrg battle she proved her leadership skills by monitoring activity in a way and taking notes of developments which lead the team to success the fact that she innovative and curious also makes her entrepreneurial the talents is currently pursuing her degree in energy environmental sciences once she completes her study programme hopes to participate in small sustainable projects where she be part of an ambitious team and be involved in all facets of business another possibility for her is to be a consultant offer her specialized knowledge to different companies in energy sector when it comes to her career plans dreams to help governments and big companies understand needs and cooperate in order to implement solutions when it comes to their energy and material interestingly enough it was the brent spar affair in norway left a lasting impression on aagje and it was then that she interested in the energy sector now she finds that the between the increasing energy demand and the shrinking of is the main challenge of the energy sector aagje believes that need to break the habits from this past century in which centralized power plants have been generating electricity heat for a large group of consumers local participation green projects that fit with the energy needs and budgets participants could be an elegant solution this energy generation can be optimized for multiple factors in the netherlands solar panels in the desert for aagje the nrg battle was a good playground to learn cooperate within multidisciplinary teams which she thinks is essential part of the upcoming transition in the energy towards a more sustainable future not only was the within my team exciting with many different backgrounds the contacts i had with members of other teams also truly inspiring and positive it seemed to me as if all students together represented a new highly active and generation ready to offer their capacity to the energy i can envision myself developing more sustainable and chemical reactors using micro fluidic we need to promote mutual excellence because together we achieve jiajun team team study master of science in chemical engineering at tu delft the talent strategic jiajun cen has a natural way of foreseeing future trends bringing the most feasible ideas in the here and the now with structured plan he is a true strategic talent strategic are very rare and should be nurtured they are the bridge between those with a vision and the operational staff jiajun controlled and structured innovation and creation which for might seem like competing concepts he obtained his master science degree from the delft university of technology tu with a specialisation in process engineering and a focus on mathematics analysis and modelling of transport phenomena reaction kinetics in addition he completed an honours that included courses on photovoltaics and nuclear the ambitious talent founded an honours community consisting of top students of leiden university and served as the of the community for two years he is a board member of the and technology leadership association stela an network aimed at developing outstanding skills at stela jiajun teaches students the leadership model that originates from mit sloan school management and harvard business jiajun would like to have a leading role at a research and to combine leadership with his passion and love for engineering he imagines a world where elegant and efficient fluidic technologies can produce chemicals in a sustainable way make healthcare and diagnosis of diseases affordable for classes this is why jiajun applied for a phd chemical engineering at imperial college in london i can myself developing more sustainable and efficient chemical using micro fluidic technologies he says jiajun wants contribute to creating a peaceful and energy efficient world which science and technology are crucial elements from perspective local policies in many regions on earth are bottleneck for a sustained development of the global energy jiajun thinks it is important to invest in nuclear technologies make them better and safer he also inquires about the behind policies that prevent more developed foreign countries deploy solar pv and solar concentrators in desert the most appealing way to learn about multidisciplinary work is be involved in a team project this is what drove jiajun to the battle which is for him a way to seek for opportunities and push my limits be out of my comfort zone and enter the his team came up with a conceptual design for the battery which can store excess energy from solar cells during hours the competition allowed jiajun to put the leadership theory into practice so he could structure brainstorming sessions boost the workflow and do most of design and the modelling work required to get the team into in order to get the same amount of energy out of renewable sustainable sources tremendously big investments have to be live in a liveable lisanne de team team study bachelor of science in technology policy and management tu delft in the talent multi talent with an accent on efficiency lisanne is a multi talent this is a unique talent because combines the drive for results efficiency team spirit innovation in one person lisanne can change her depending on the situation does the situation call for quick decisive action lisanne will push for results is the team in of structure she will make a controllable and structured never losing sight of team spirit because of her ability to effectively between situations

in energy industry and water at delft university technology tu additionally she is part of a dream realisation of extremely advanced machines team her team called team delft and is trying to design vehicle aiming to be the most vehicle in the world lisanne wants to work for one of the energy companies the energy sector has always attracted especially the renewable and sustainable energy sector in opinion sustainable and renewable energy will be the future in the beginning only combined with fossil according to lisanne one of the biggest challenges the sector is facing right now is climate change she notes in to get the same amount of energy out of renewable and sources tremendously big investments have to be made lisanne driven by the need for humanity to change its current energy behaviour to live in a liveable world we cannot simply the current energy consumption without expecting drastic changes she remarks lisanne observes that the energy needs to look at different out of the box renewable sources energy and at clean ways to store the overproduction during the nrg battle lisanne and her team created a solution fujifilm called the blue battery our solution is a clean way store electricity our focus was on the of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar store electricity for the time being and get it out when needed proud we made it into the finals of the nrg battle europe she says her role within the team was to enable creation of different perspectives on the problem at hand when rest of her team got stuck the nrg battle was for lisanne a way of meeting people with a common interest in energy exploring very interesting challenges i would summarize the battle as being very inspirational and it has so far opened a world for lack of policies not technology has hampered the usage of be the change you want to see in the varun aiyar team team study in sustainable energy technology at tu delft in talent management and leadership varun is a very gifted and talented individual his aim is implement structured and planned ways for deploying technologies varun is a management and leadership talent him into a leader that sees what needs to be done not only on executing side but also on the political side of the that is why he is currently pursuing a master of science sustainable energy technology at delft university of technology he wished to specialize in policy implementation and to successfully execute sustainable systems varun holds a of science in technology in mechanical and energy engineering vit university india he graduated with honours and specialized the fields of energy audit and economics solar thermal systems energy systems production and storage and generation his thesis was in the field of converting biogas to cng for according to varun the crisis that we are facing worldwide global warming to economic meltdown was caused by mismanagement energy resources varun considers it his duty to be the needed in the energy system the talent has a clear career path mind with a sound technical background he felt the need develop new technologies but after working for quite some he realized that humanity has more than enough technology achieve on the renewable front lack of not technology has hampered the usage of green energy that is varun wants to utilize his knowledge to work with policy divisions like the un energy or panels that bring a shift through a shift in work track record is impressive he developed an electrolyte for sofc a rocket for atmospheric studies and materials that could be used in a solid oxide fuel cell he designed and fabricated a new adsorption column for less than tenth of the industry costs he loves out of box ideas energy harvesting with pv systems which could the energy crisis for centuries to come varun notes in order to have a sustainable development governments emphasize green energy projects industries should be asked submit a transition plan the transportation sector needs travel routes and vehicles that use hybrid technology and the needs to transition to a smart grid for varun the nrg battle is an immense opportunity to implement think and grow it had all the ingredients that let me develop into an energy professional with a much better holistic point of view varun remarks that his team had the mix of talent skills and knowledge at the battle he had the of looking into the technical and the economic feasibility of plan that he and his team had more than of energy is wasted around the world this can changed if more value is given to the energy used every set your goals with the power of commitment have the courage pursue them and stand silvana team team study master of science in energy and environmental sciences university of groningen in the talent multi talent with strong leadership and management silvana is a powerful lady with strong ideals one of her goals to bring back knowledge to her home country peru silvana is multi talent this means she is a situational leader or a manager combining the drive for results innovation and team spirit with a natural ease silvana is able to groups to results and coordinate their plans and actions at same time she graduated in as an industrial engineer from university of lima in peru after her graduation she worked for global environmental consultancy and assisted in the impact assessment of energy related projects in peru silvana is studying for a master of science in energy environmental her interest in the energy sector started in when participated in a national competition organized by bayer peru with her project energy in this silvana connected home production of renewable energy to grids after doing research on her own and volunteering environmental projects in peru silvana decided she wanted specialize in energy and work for a sustainable future she came the netherlands in as an exchange the talent believes that transitioning into a world of energy is one of the biggest challenges that the energy sector facing nowadays the development of smart communities where production is independent for every household is a good in this way consumers are also energy producers and can sell energy they use back to the grid another solution to silvana is to invest in environmental education for generations this is important because more than of energy wasted around the world this can be changed if more value is to the energy used every day silvana believes that cooperation is very important in making decisions for regulations and sustainable the nrg battle is more than a competition it is an where you can meet people with the same interests as yours battle gives you the opportunity to network and to find for real problems that people face daily the proposed might be able to bring a better future for everyone says her team liander was challenged with finding a solution for farmer who wanted to install solar panels on his roof the of the grid enough to transfer all the energy generated upgrading the grid was too expensive hence a percentage of was wasted the team made it to the finals with an idea cloud silvana thinks that the nrg battle should promoted with

says but the hard truth is that there is far research showing the ill effects of unequal time than research that elt policies can make up the difference less time may be a of poor performance but that mean that more time necessarily the the report released by education sector last month reviews on how schools are using increased learning time mandated by federal government the variations are adding minutes to school day to providing afterschool programs shortening and lunch some approaches show clear potential while others considerable limits to as sensible as using existing time differently sounds its often fall well short of the mark the study says many schools proposing to gain time for instruction by decreasing time namely lunch recess or the time allotted for students to between classes by doing so off the clock warns they are technical compliance with federal rules instead of the hard work comprehensive the report notes that schools that have succeeded with extended have done so largely because they include time as part of a comprehensive reform it reviews successful models including tasc new york citizen schools in boston and the providence after alliance in rhode new designs for extended time should be a part of the improvement plans the report concludes but policymakers and leaders must recognize that successful schools use time not just extend hours and days

brief interview with mayor michael bloomberg we discussed motivation for launching the nationwide challenge examples innovative social solutions the proper relationship philanthropy and government and the intersection of leadership and michael r bloomberg is the th mayor of the city of new rahim kanani how did the mayors challenge come mayor bloomberg we created the mayors project to spread proven promising ideas among cities mayors and other local leaders have understanding of the issues americans face and in cases they are championing innovative solutions we know these spread to other cities as often or as quickly as they should and so mayors are left stuck the wheel the challenge which is an initiative of the mayors project cities with a powerful incentive to promote and share bold ideas can help address the pressing social and economic issues facing country rahim kanani what are some examples of social innovation that you point to as the kinds of ideas and projects hoping to and scale across the mayor bloomberg the mayors challenge website highlights a few examples like system which set a new standard government accountability and customer service and programs for city

space technology and data to innovative solutions to a predetermined series of challenges the following ted talk for examples of the power of open global challenges have been set and are grouped in four four australian challenges have been added to the list of challenge disaster prevention minimizing risk through satellite data is invaluable for assisting emergency services and respond to natural disasters tropical cyclones fire flood but is there way that satellite data can be used to help us and reduce challenge design and implement a tool that uses satellite data detect potential hazards trees growing too close to transmission lines vegetation type landscape this app could the ability for the community to flag potential challenge my travel what would convince you to change your travel behaviours carbon this challenge aims to develop an app that provides users information about their travel patterns and quantifies the impact their choices users could be presented with a summary of their trip eg distance travelled in the last week the last month and last year and how their mode choice behaviour has impacted them and the wider community the app could also allow users interrogate their carbon footprint and compare this to other choices eg driving riding and walking and the relative of carbon and money as a result of their users could also be presented with historical and forecast weather from bureau of meteorology suggesting days to consider based on weather the app may rely on submitting their travel data from their smart card eg myki challenge activity how many people do you work with how many people are around you any one time this challenge is to develop a system that activity in a relatively small scale location for example a or public space this can use any type of fixed sensor that locations and densities of people and presents the data in a realtime visualisation also offering an historic analysis shows how densities change over time this challenge could use variety of sensors depending on what people have available instance heat pressure sound ip addresses wifi hotspot bluetooth or any combination of on a larger scale this challenge could lead to assist police estimating crowd numbers help planners to track how many people an event and help pedestrian and traffic engineers to design changes in a public challenge climate adaptation building a better satellite data is helping us understand our environment and how it changing this data is used to build climate models that help predict what the local conditions will be in the future infrastructure projects take many years to design and build and an integral part of our society for a long time but how do they to changing conditions how can designers and engineers

too old to create think again here some incredible examples to inspire you to go for it click screen bottom right icon for easiest the creative catalyzing the creative idea posted by mitch ditkoff at pm comments january the martial arts of the ten years ago i was invited to teach a course on innovation business growth at crotonville management development for high potential business superstars of the the ge executive who hired me was a very savvy guy with the task of orienting new adjunct faculty members to high and often harsher my intelligence was exceeded only by his candor as proceeded to tell me in no uncertain terms that ge gave instructors two shots at making the grade explaining with a smile that most outside consultants were intimidated the first they taught at ge and necessarily at the top of their not sure how you say it in esperanto but in english what he translates as the heat is on big i knew i would have to raise my game if i expected to be invited after my audition was and so i went about my business of getting ready keeping in mind i was going to be leading a hour session for of best brightest flown half way around the world high flying type personalities with a high regard for themselves and a very threshold for anything they judged to be unworthy of their i had five weeks to prepare five weeks to get my act together weeks to dig in and front load my agenda with everything i needed wow my audience case studies statistics quotes factoids and best practices than you could shake a blackberry i was ready really ready like a rookie center fielder on steroids i was or so i the more i spoke the less they listened the less they listened more i spoke trotting out compelling facts and truckloads information to make my case as they blankly stared and checked email under the psychologists i believe would characterize my approach compensatory i talked faster i talked louder i worked harder attempting various pitiful ways to pull imaginary rabbits out of imaginary needless to say best and brightest for the entire of my opening act were not clearly i was playing a losing my attempt to the ge people was a proposition i need new facts new statistics or new quotes i needed a new a way to secure the attention of my audience and help them make shift from skepticism to and i needed to do it five minutes not the next few days were very uncomfortable for me replaying in my again and again my lame choice of an opening gambit and what in the world i could do to get better results in much less and then like an unexpected ipo from mars it hit me the as a student of aikido i knew how amazing the martial arts were what a great metaphor they were for fast forward a few my second session at crotonville began exactly like the first the program director reading my bio to the group in an heroic to impress everyone they taking my cue i walked to center stage scanned the audience uttered nine raise your hand if a bold risk not a single hand went up not i stood my ground and surveyed the really i said you are best and brightest and not one of is a bold risk taker i find that hard to ten rows back a hand went up slowly halfway like a kid in a school math class not wanting to offend the great i bellowed pointing to the risk taker stand and join me in the front of the you could cut the air with a i welcomed my assistant to the stage and asked him if had any explaining that i had called him forth to attack me from behind was going to demonstrate a martial arts move shown to me by my aikido instructor a pound woman who i once saw throw a man through a pin drop i asked our bold risk taker to stand behind me and grab both of wrists and instructed him to hold on tight as i attempted to get an effort that yielded no i casually mentioned how the scenario being played out on stage is a typical work day has become for most of us lots of resistance and with the audience completely focused on the moment i noted a simple principles of aikido and how anyone with the application of energy and the right amount of practice could the as i demonstrated the move my attacker was quickly neutralized and was no longer victim but in total in three minutes things had shifted not only for me and my but for everyone in the when i mentioned that force was not the same thing as power and that martial artists know how to get maximum results with a of effort and that indeed innovation was all about the arts of the mind a way to get extraordinary results in an ps i was invited back times to deliver the the every day no matter what our profession education or sign we are all faced with the same challenge how to communicate our message to this challenge is particularly difficult these days given the glut information we all must contend with the amount of available to us is doubling every ten years yearly more than million books are published daily we are bombarded with more advertising messages and emails as a result most of us ourselves in a defensive posture protecting ourselves from onslaught of what discovered in the past years of working with some of most powerful organizations is that if i really want to get my message across got to deliver it in a what that gets the guardians at the gate the default condition of disengagement and derision that comes with the territory of life the st century business my rite of passage at ge was a microcosm of this indeed my presumptive effort to win over my audience by them with data case studies and best practices was a losing game only was i barking up the wrong tree i was in the wrong the key to my breaking through the collective skepticism of and brightest a matter of information it was a they need to analyze they needed to engage and it was my to make that easy to do or as mahatma gandhi so deftly put it i to be the change i wanted to see in the i had to do something that invoked the curious playful associative right brain not the logical linear analytical left tricky business indeed especially when you consider that business people these days have a very low threshold for they judge to be which is why i chose the martial arts as the operational metaphor ge my attempt to move them from the dow to the impractical not at bottom line whether we know it or not we have all entered experience economy a time when being involved is at least important as being information is no longer sufficient to spark change data is no king thinking only takes us part of the way home feeling completes the journey the kind of feeling that leads to full curiosity and the kind of engagement that opens the door to new which is exactly what happened at ge when i made the shift marshaling my facts to marshaling my energy and by extension energy of of best and food for thought what message have you been trying to deliver too little impact that might be communicated in a totally way a way that more successfully engages people and leads measurable idea applied my my

articulated problem unmotivated no transition from business as insufficient diversity of addiction to the status lack of clear ground sterile meeting hidden or competing lack of robust meeting the

the quality of your brainstorming one way to turn things posted by mitch ditkoff at am comments december the real flowering of ednote the following is dedicated to all the male readers of blog especially those who are married work too hard and about innovation just a little too today in a sudden fit of love and appreciation i bought a dozen and brought them home to my usually when i think of buying roses i go through a sequence of events first i surrender to a wonderful feeling expansiveness that takes me over then i get curious and smell flowers then i ask the shopkeeper how long she thinks the roses last then i ask the per stem price do the math and reach pitifully male conclusion that is way too much too spend something that last out the week and is probably less somewhere else and obviously indulgent of me to be buying so roses when got two kids to put through college in a few years besides beauty is all of this of course is my inner woody allen taking the low road response to what is obviously a johnny depp so i dig deep and bring the roses home my entire living room shape around i then become very aware that there are definitely not enough in the room in a curious way the recent appearance of roses has the rest of the room seem barren tabletops and shelves that minutes ago were doing just fine are now utterly so i do the only thing a man can do when faced with such a paradox return to the flower but the shop is closed closed impossible i need so i get back in my car and speed my way to the other flower shop it too is closed or should i say closing the owner is the door and giving me the but i will not be denied and he knows what do you want he cut flowers i he signals me to enter and i buy way more flowers than makes sense ridiculous put it this way if i was in the federal witness program my sudden flower buying behavior would have put my handlers in a fast forward ten minutes to my wife in our she is looking at me as if i am totally insane me the guy who days ago was making an airtight case for a more modest my flowers first logic second if money is tight buy more flowers more flowers you buy the more money will appear and if not in lifetime then the next or maybe the one after ok there you go my not very financially sound of the universe you my friend are a witness if i forget remind indeed next time we meet you have my permission to ask me

with novel and creative ideas invented concept of brainstorming in the late his book imagination described how to apply the concept in very simple osborne put forth two basic principles defer judgment and focus these days people attempting to lead ideation sessions are mindful of the first principle but they almost never remember second and this quite simply is a big reason why most sessions fail to produce even mediocre two gear at first glance the quantity principle seems can people come up with quality ideas you might ask by not for quality but a method to this madness and it has to do with how minds work and how we are trained to if you are asked to come up with good and novel ideas in to a problem challenge or opportunity whether you are working or with others you will tend to aim for the best ideas possible sense however in your striving for the best idea you will tend to ideas you consider to be when ideas pop into our minds we tend to judge them immediately as small too big too pedestrian too unrealistic too obvious goofy too ordinary too expensive or too as if the red queen is ensconced in our brains shouting with his head at every idea that dares to speak because human beings are conditioned to see wrong with idea before seeing its like seeing a baby bird and judging it to be inadequate because fly and this process is barely conscious we dismiss our ideas so that we often even notice they were thought of at all nothing becomes our if you are generating ideas in a group and everyone is this phenomenon at the exact same time the great silence inevitably head its ugly rear no one will be willing to share any the ideas that have popped into their heads because their ideas will deemed to be inadequate or this is why experts are usually the worst brainstormers educated experienced and cognizant of all the ins and outs of topic being brainstormed experts will immediately see the flaws the possibilities killing promising new ideas with the of a healthy immune system killing off a germ or this is why many forward thinking focus groups bring in children to generate new ideas people whose idea immune are not yet fully think about it for a moment if ordinary ideas can be articulated announced and captured then an interesting thing happen other people can improve the ideas one idea will lead another and another and another radically increasing the odds something truly original this kind of magic however cannot happen if principle striving for quantity is think of dual principles as two sides of the same defer judgment postpones the act of criticizing ideas as they generated focusing on quantity helps us defer our tendency to our ideas as they are not unlike the proverbial coin if you have both sides got val idea virtual brainstorm high velocity posted by mitch ditkoff at pm comments november asking for permission to a useful tip for you the next time you find yourself standing front of a group of people and about to facilitate a meeting of before you begin ask people to give you permission to this may sound like a complete waste of time especially if brought in by the to facilitate the meeting but not essential if your meeting is anything like the other million meetings held each day in corporate america chances are good that there will a time during your gathering when at least one person bored distracted or angry that they asked to facilitate will something consciously or unconsciously to derail the this something can take many forms everything from checking email under the table to returning late from breaks ranting on any number of topics that have absolutely nothing to do the matter at hand moments that will require a skillful response from the if you bothered to ask for permission to facilitate will resist or ignore your spontaneous interventions every step the way and if they resist you every step of the way they silently retreat into their own private idaho perceiving you in fevered mind as an invasive disempowering or bottom line you will lose and if the people you lose should happen to be tribal chieftains any one of the many feudal kingdoms represented in the room that you will lose a bunch of other people as well their this is not the outcome you want an outcome that will lead you triangulating to third parties or wishing you had gone into dry cleaning the way out of this mess within the first five minutes of your meeting after establishing a simple ground rules let everyone know that you need their to play your facilitator role that there may be some times the meeting when you may have to ask someone to hold a thought shift their behavior in some way and that unless you have permission to do so they will likely end up resenting you or mistreated when in fact all you are trying to do is ensure that meeting is a productive invariably meeting participants will gladly give their permission you to facilitate even if they chuckle under their breath doing so and if they just sit there silently after your request bumps on an analog all you need to do is ask them to give you kind of visible indication that they agree either by standing up giving you the thumbs this simple act of people visibly giving you permission to is often the difference between success and failure especially later in the meeting someone starts acting out or marching to drummer from another armed with the permission they gave you at the beginning of meeting all you need to do is reinforce the ground rule forgotten and remind them that all doing is playing the they gave you permission to

most corporations life on other planets or trying to get teenagers to clean up unless the individuals within an organization have a genuine sense urgency personal ownership and an authentic passion for nothing much will corporate initiatives that fail to awaken the human instinct innovate are doomed no matter how many pep talks tote bags for me as an innovation consultant it is clear that the short of time i have with my clients needs to be devoted to awakening passion to tools techniques theory data models bibliographies cases best practices and the fabulous muffins served on are all fine but it is the passion to innovate that is the real of no passion no innovation plain and unfortunately most organizations squash passion that is why have a much easier time innovating than fortune

noodled conjured envisioned ideated piggybacked and overly enthusiastic facilitators doing their facilitator you may have even gotten some results but even the best run brainstorming sessions are based on questionable assumption that the origination of powerful new depend on the facilitated interaction between two gear you know the two heads are better than one like to propose an alternative for the moment two heads better than one for the moment i invite you to consider the possibility that origination of great new ideas take place in the storm but the calm before the storm or the calm after the storm sometimes even in the eye of the storm every wonder why so many people get their best ideas during down the time just before they go to sleep or just after waking in dreams or in the shower or in the car on the way home those brainstorming sessions folks those are sessions incubation those are time outs for the hyperactive child genius within us who always on the methinks in business world we have become addicted to the look busy is the mantra not look we want high winds we want lightning we want proof that something happening even if the proof turns out to be nothing more than and high winds do not last all morning sometimes the storm has to why some of your like to show up early at the before anyone else has arrived for many of us the only time have to the best thinking has been done in solitude said thomas edison worst has been done in not suggesting that you stop brainstorming um of our all suggesting is you balance it out with braincalming the combination

newly online brainstorm facilitation training guess he liked iframe httpaddr why posted by mitch ditkoff at pm comments october the dna of invoking most people think that the ability to be innovative is a mystical available only to the chosen the effort they imagine takes a lot of time and hard work and they have time and like hard work they reason innovation just in the cards for but innovation is not a mystical state a natural state a birthright the people in your organization in fact already innovative the only thing is their natural ability to be is being obscured by their own habits of mind and a variety bothersome organizational their challenge is the same one as seeing the hidden arrow in fedex logo look between the e and the arrow has always there but most people never notice this is the work of idea champions we help people see what already have but know how to we help people make meaningful adjustments of vision insight perception so they can acknowledge embrace and apply their ability to be more creative on the job and for those clients want to reinvent their innovation process we help them figure what follows is a brief summary of how we do know thy long before we ever get into a room with participants we do our diligence learning about who we are serving what they expect how our time with them will be the most sometimes this takes the form of phone interviews or online polls studying key documents our clients send us in order to understand current reality industry business challenges constraints and hoped for based on our assessment of our needs we put together a plan to get the job done towards this end we draw on more than modules been developing since early in the design process we invite our clients to give us about our approach their feedback stirs the creative soup and us with the input needed to transform a good session design into great spacing we make a great deal of effort to ensure that the space in which sessions take place are as ideal as possible form may follow but function also follows when participants walk into an idea champions session they begin shifting even before the session begins it is both our belief experience that is a huge x factor for and drive fear out of the peter drucker sage management consultant was a proponent of removing fear from the workplace so are we towards end each of our sessions begins with a process that it easy for participants to establish a dynamic culture of for the organizations innovate people do but not just any people people who are energized curious confident fascinated focused adaptive collaborative and people who emerge from our sessions are significantly more in with these innovation qualities than when they began their have changed they see opportunities when previously all they were they let go of perfectionism old paradigms and habitual ways thinking in their place listening idea original thinking full engagement and the kind of commitment drives meaningful balancing human beings by nature are dualistic ie us vs vs incremental vs breakthrough brain vs right the contradictions that show up in a corporate environment workshop can either be innovation depleters or innovation it all depends how these seeming conflicting territories are idea champions is committed to thinking not just brain or left brain our work with organizations has shown us that one of the for innovation is a ability to strike the balance these each workshop we lead and each consulting engagement we commit to guided by our understanding of how to help our clients find the balance between the expert facilitation a rock pile ceases to be a rock pile someone contemplates it with the idea of a cathedral in mind st this quite simply is what idea champions does but we do far than just contemplate we also architect and since been facilitating engagements a wide variety of industries we have mastered the art and science turning lead or leaders into gold and we can train your people to the same thing we experiential challenges what i hear i forget what i see remember what i do i so said the great chinese sage confucius this word quote the essence of our work simply put we get people off their ifs or buts and into the experience of while we value theory research models data best practices cases and most of the other flora and fauna of business life come to understand that the challenge of sparking breakthrough and change is best accomplished by doing not why all of our sessions include experiential challenges provide participants with visible ways of seeing innovation in what supports it and what obscures emergent design awakening the creativity of an workforce is not a although all of our interventions begin with carefully crafted plans and agendas our facilitators are fluent in the art and of making the kind of adjustments refinements improvisations that are the difference between a good session and great facilitators who attempt to imitate our approach find it difficult succeed without first learning how to master the art of design the good news is that it can be learned and this is just of the things we teach in our train the trainer edutainment idea champions sessions are a hybrid of two education and entertainment we know that when participants enjoying themselves their chances of learning increase why we make all of our sessions a hybrid of education entertainment participants do not get tired they do not get they do not sneak long looks at their full engagement idea champions sessions are highly our facilitators are skilled at teasing out the brilliance participants regardless of their social style job title astrological sign but perhaps more importantly our facilitators know how to participants tease out each brilliance eventually gets into the act the shy people take center stage and the players take a back seat the collective wisdom in the room gets chance to be accessed and convergence idea champions is successful because what we do and one of the reasons why it works is because our sessions participants translate ideas into ideas are powerful but they are still only the fuzzy front end of innovation process ultimately they need to turn into creativity needs to be commercialized our workshops trainings consulting interventions help our clients do exactly tools techniques and takeaways ideas champions closes the between rhetoric and reality we just talk about innovation teach about it we spark the experience of it and we do that in practical one way is by teaching people how to use specific techniques to access their innate creativity another way is providing our clients with a variety of processes and materials that can be immediately used on the free the posted by

positions of authority they must justify their position by providing the best solutions to problems they often this need to demonstrate that one has the answer is grounded a deeply rooted fear that one in fact does not truly know what to and that revealing uncertainty will lead to an erosion confidence in superiors and they see their authority as grounded in their knowledge and and feel obliged

unjustified rigidity of positions and inability to see the value of alternative points of if we must constantly prove to everyone that we deserve the position have attained we can never allow ourselves to be seen as needing learn anything or to rely on anyone this dilemma often referred to as the impostor syndrome systematically undermines ability to learn to benefit from perspectives of others and to appreciate the value of strengths and points of it also often leads to behaviors in which we diminish others in to reassure ourselves of our importance and our lastly it virtually

their inadequacy in service of making own position more the ability to influence goes beyond the ability to make a argument of course it can also involve the use of power or fear to drive others to a particular what is much more rarely recognized is the role of listening empathy in the influence listening to what concerns and drives others provides a powerful for influence because it is by showing how your perspective will the concerns and interests of others that you gain interest but the case for listening and empathy goes much if you can truly understand what others value and are concerned it can lead you to change your position about what is required achieve the goals you are striving if you deeply understand others you can mobilize them not manipulation but by gearing your approach to address the real and interests of your listening and appreciating multiple viewpoints can help you gain acceptance for your ideas and better ideas and as it all plays these better ideas will

others get only creative breakdowns alternately blaming society their company and their increasingly suspect is it true that people who experience breakthroughs are gifted are there other factors at work factors that we the people more control over than we might while nobody can deny that some people seem to be blessed creative leanings ie mozart at research has shown that can have the much sought after aha experience that is if immerse themselves in the little understood process of time and again the literature bears this out great breakthroughs usually happen only after intense periods of immersion struggle even it is sustained and focused effort towards a specific goal not wishing or caffeine that ultimately prepares the ground creative this kind of effort does not always generate immediate results sometimes leads people to conclude that just not in the cards alas they forget during their inevitable encounters with doubt the big aha is never far away and can happen at any time

student in th century france young dropped out of school at the age of upon realizing that the thing he had learned was that he was completely law school proved no better nor did a brief stint in the military an aborted career as a frustrated with the choices available to him descartes decided retire at the ripe old age of while his parents teachers and friends pleaded with him to change mind young rene was adamant and for the next two years did else but stay in bed read think dream and curiously one night in the second year of his retreat descartes had dream in which the essence of what we now know as the method was revealed to in time his discovery was shared with the scientific community western science had a new hero ah the paradox of it while scientists far and wide heralded descartes for his to western rational science no one in their right mind acknowledge that the root of discovery came to him in dream a altered state of consciousness the mind of a descartes story is not at all the truth the breakthrough the aha came to him only after years intense conscious like ripe fruit the answer made its appearance at the right time time when he trying but had let himself be receptive to promptings of his own subconscious elias elias howe had struggled for years in his attempt to invent a stitch sewing machine his early designs though inspired were indeed the needle he designed had a hole in the middle of the which simply then one night depressed at how slowly things were going dreamed he was captured by a bunch of savages who took him before the elias howe screamed the monarch i command you upon the pain death to finish this machine at try as he might howe still could not find the solution the making good on his word immediately ordered his troops to take howe the place of execution dream pun as howe was being led away he looked up and noticed that the the savages were carrying had holes near the top in a flash howe awoke jumped out of bed and spent the rest of night whittling a model of the new improved needle the breakthrough that quickly brought his experiments to a richard at the age of richard wagner was going through a serious crisis his artistic career was stalled his marriage was apart and his finances were in desperate he decided to travel hoping to find some traveling however only tired then one morning just at the moment when he finally gave up on frantic effort to invoke his muse wagner heard a musical theme in dream one that was about to change his life and the history explained wagner after a night spent in fever and sleeplessness forced myself to take a long walk through the country it looked and desolate upon my return i lay down on a hard couch sleep not come but i sank into a kind of somnambulance in which i felt as though i were sinking in swiftly flowing the rushing noise formed itself into a musical sound the chord of flat major whence developed melodic passages of increasing motion awoke in sudden

atoms were gamboling before eyes whenever those diminutive beings had appeared to me before had always been in motion but i had never been able to discern nature of their now however i saw how frequently how smaller atoms united to form pair how a larger one embraced two smaller ones how still larger kept hold of three or even four of the smaller while the whole whirring in a giddy i saw how the larger ones formed a chain i spent part of the putting on paper at least a sketch of these dream then years later the big illumination made i turned my chair to the fire and dozed again the atoms gamboling before my eyes this time the smaller groups kept modestly the background my mental eye rendered more acute by repeated of this kind could now distinguish larger structureslong sometimes more closely fitted together all twining and twisting snakelike but look what was that one of the snakes had seized hold of its tail and the form whirled mockingly before my eyes as if by a

powerful new piece truthdig entitled we need free thinkers or society will up and like to expand on we need prophets and as my good friend roberta a devoted student the torah remarked the other day a prophet is not someone foretells the future a prophet is someone who speaks the truth here in the moment saying what needs to be said whether or not and it usually we have had some prophets in recent times comedian george carlin was prophet for example and so was bill they told us what needed to be said but they made us laugh about it we stone them to death when they did maybe chris hedges is but today we lack people who can see the bigger picture and help make sense of things because in great part we have cut ourselves from an essential part of we have neglected half of our human inheritance in fact we dismissed it made it an orphan and cast it into the human being is a creature of balance why we get so when our child takes first after being born this is the most significant event in a human it means we are learning about the fundamental reality of being we are mastering with every step we take in our lives there is a moment where we to find our balance or fall down once mastered we do this elegantly that we even notice this remarkable skill much like cheetah know how breathtakingly fast it runs or a bird know how beautifully it flies it just does physical balance is only one small part of we are always balancing some kind of duality a duality we are always dealing with the reality of opposites we also have arms two legs two eyes two ears two nostrils two vocal cords two brains and what i want to talk about we have one brain we have two and supposed to work tandem like a team of but our society has lost a critical balance between our two brains are overworking one horse and ignoring the other so it starves or to put it another way instead of using our hammer to do what it designed to do and our screwdriver to do what designed to do are trying to do everything with the hammer it is not the fault that it deal with the and removal of screws it is ours for expecting the hammer to be to do this at in terms of our two brains commonly referred to as the left brain the right brain we are a biased culture and that is in the final analysis killing us and everything else on when our body gets out of balance in some way commonly to as when our minds are out of balance that should understood as mental our culture being out of balance the use of our brains is in some sense mentally our left brain is the brain that sees the individual differences categorizes measures experiences time and follows single line of the brain that tells us when to cross the street safely product is the better buy and which clothes we should wear that best suit the the brain created science mathematics logic reason all manner of technology it sees things and can count divide multiply and categorize those specialty is isolation and singularity useful convincing so useful and convincing that we have identified with when you ask people who they are they usually respond in a way indicates that the sum collection of the workings of their left is their the left brain however cannot prophesy because it cannot see the material physical realm it even know that anything but the material realm it cannot see how the individual things it can see might be in unexpected it even imagine such things the left brain cannot since it sees others as separate entities as objects out cannot have hunches it cannot create a metaphor it cannot see whole just the if it wants to know more about a cat it kills the cat dissects cat takes out and measures all the parts of the cat and then feels if it understands what a cat is it even entertain the that a better way to know what a cat is might be to live with a watch the cat and empathize with the cat an approach that has additional benefit of still having a cat when all is said and those qualities of connectivity and wholeness and warmth all belong the kingdom of the right the right brain has insights and can imagine what is not yet it can be inspired it can connect with the heart so it can feel experience joy or sadness and the entire range of it can put this experience of connectivity and emotion into language of music and form and movement it can see possibility and road not taken it is somewhat magical it is now not burdened by past or worried about a future and it is what we often refer to as a society we have rejected the genius of the right brain and we suffering this imbalance every single day in a myriad of we suffer with psychological isolation and drug addiction we when quantity trumps quality in our food our sex lives and education we suffer when we create extremes of wealth health value that cause tensions in our society that explode into we suffer when we scapegoat people and create and bogeymen that we try to destroy creating war injustice chaos we suffer when we exploit our planet and our fellow creatures for profit without realizing that we are destroying our lifeline that we are cutting off the very branch we are sitting way past the time when we have to recognize our full humanity start paying a whole lot more attention to our ignored and magical right we are suffering unnecessarily because we are not in balance with own true we are the thinking creature only using half of our thinking and not even the better half in my we are like the cheetah using only two of its four legs to run or bird trying to fly by flapping only one is this prophecy i know but what i do know is that we need find our balance in our thinking and soon or we will all the bad the good news is that we are designed to do exactly posted by mitch ditkoff at pm comments january how to go beyond self in

would have none of it of course they what i was was completely ridiculous but because the way i said it entertaining and they were not only forgiving suddenly much lighter and much more engaged than before i left the just minutes in fact it would not be an exaggeration to say that in the three of facilitating innovation and business growth sessions at ge i never seen a group of people as focused engaged and happy to be the room as this particular group was at this particular moment in some strange way i had accomplished in three minutes from a location the bathroom what usually took me at

big problem at one of treasured monuments the jefferson memorial in washington simply put birds in huge numbers were pooping all over it made visiting the place a very unpleasant attempts to remedy the situation caused even bigger problems since harsh cleaning detergents being used were damaging the fortunately some of the national parks managers assigned to the began asking why as in why was the jefferson memorial so much of a target for birds than any of the other a little bit of investigation revealed the the birds were attracted to the jefferson memorial because of abundance of spiders a gourmet treat for the spiders were attracted to the memorial because of the abundance midges insects that were nesting and the midges were attracted to the memorial because of the midges it turns out like to procreate in places were the light just so and because the lights were turned on at the memorial one hour before dark it created the kind of mood that midges went crazy so there you have it the midges were attracted to the light spiders were attracted to the midges the birds were attracted to spiders and the national parks workers though not attracted to the bird poop were attracted to getting paid so spent a lot of their time and taxpayer money cleaning the how did the situation resolve very after reviewing the curious chain of events that led up to the the decision was made to wait until dark before turning the lights at the jefferson that delay was enough to ruin the mood lighting for midges who then decided to have midge sex somewhere no midges no spiders no spiders no birds no birds no poop poop no need to clean the jefferson memorial so often case now consider what solutions might have been forthcoming if curious national parks managers did not stop and ask hire more workers to clean the ask existing workers to work experiment with different kinds of cleaning put bird poison all around the hire hunters to shoot the encase the entire jefferson memorial in move the memorial to another part of close the site to the general technically speaking each of the above solutions was a approach but at great cost inconvenience and with they were shall we say not exactly elegant now think about your business your company your what problems are you facing that could be approached simply by asking why and then why again and then why until you get to the core of

objects in our lives things we see daily but often take like the stop sign for most people think the stop sign was created to regulate traffic according to dr ellison burke of the global institute for things down before you hurt yourself badly the origin of the stop has nothing to do with traffic and dates back several historical references to the stop sign have been noted in more than civilizations most notably babylonia egypt mesopotamia crete rome and the han according to social scientists each of these civilizations one or more periods of rapid growth now referred to in the as societal acceleration syndrome the way in which transactions speed up in proportion to a gross national in other words speed has become one of the most predicable indicators of a development and as i get to later in this posting eventual my research end here in each of the civilizations there have always been small but vocal group of citizens who concerned about quickening pace of daily life have warned about this indeed a joint longitudinal study conducted by the yukon institute and the asian society for shorter haiku has revealed this small but highly committed group of citizens has made efforts to diffuse their respective escalating addiction in sumeria for example a fringe group of philosophers and routinely posted styopsian signs at strategic throughout the country not to stop traffic but to stop mind their effort resonated with the citizenry and eventually led to widespread appearance of what modern day sociologists now refer to stop signs in urban centers small villages cattle universities and even one of the most curious facts unearthed in my research is for the past years stop signs regardless of the country origin have always been apparently each side of this iconic sided symbol stillness has been imbued with a secret teaching of oak lawn stop slow pay look look breathe move and so the next time you see a stop sign you may want to that you are in the act

escape answer me what the heck is the box what is this thing that keeps us so contained caged trapped claustrophobic and otherwise unable to start with the basics a box has six sides including the top the if we can understand what these six sides are know what dealing with and this knowledge will improve our chances of out or as fritz perls once said awareness let us fear if you want to raise the odds of being trapped in a box the rest of your life all you need to do is increase the amount fear you fear inhibits fear paralyzes fear subverts action indeed when rules the day even reacting is difficult fear not only puts us in box it makes it almost impossible to get out the fear of fear of judgment fear of failure fear of change fear of the fear of being revealed to be an impostor fear of

life right out of there is no box without fear get rid of fear and you get rid of powerlessness powerlessness is the state of mind in which think they have no choice that they are victims of that the act of attempting anything new is why dilbert has become the patron saint of most some people have dwelled in the state of powerlessness their entire life going all the way back to childhood

reality they are short cuts lines in the we end up taking things for granted because we are either too lazy get down to the root of things or too entranced by our own beliefs consider an ultimately it

appreciation i bought a dozen and brought them home to my usually when i think of buying roses i go through a sequence of events first i surrender to a wonderful feeling expansiveness that takes me over then i get curious and smell flowers then i ask the shopkeeper how long she thinks the roses then i ask the per stem price do the math and reach the male conclusion that is way too much too spend on something last out the week and is probably less expensive somewhere and obviously indulgent of me to be buying so many roses when got two kids to put through college in a few years and besides is all of this of course is my inner woody allen taking the low road response to what is obviously a johnny depp so i dig deep and bring the roses home my entire living room shape around i then become very aware that there are definitely not enough in the room in a curious way the recent appearance of roses has the rest of the room seem barren tabletops and shelves that minutes ago were doing just fine are now utterly so i do the only thing a man can do when faced with such a paradox return to the flower but the shop is closed closed impossible i need so i get back in my car and speed my way to the other flower shop it too is closed or should i say closing the owner is the door and giving me the but i will not be denied and he knows what do you want he flowers i he signals me to enter and i buy way more flowers than makes sense ridiculous put it this way if i was in the federal witness program my sudden flower buying behavior would have put my handlers in a fast forward ten minutes to my

vadeboncoeur idea director of for this insightful post on an important i have a handyman friend paul duffy who is a macgyver possesses an uncanny ability to improvise an inexpensive and solution for just about any electrical plumbing or problem that for example just last week he correctly diagnosed a stopped drain as being the fault of a plastic vent not properly after providing him with a pin i watched him tweak device with the pin and his trusty pocket knife so it did what it supposed to do no no run to the hardware store and paul says he learned this skill from his mother back in ireland woman who could solve any household problem with whatever was at macgyver as you might recall was a very popular american tv hero in the late and early a troubleshooter who an amazing ability usually in life and death situations to just about any complex device with everyday materials needed within matter of household cleansers could be turned into explosives or made poisons engines could be fixed with coins and bubble that kind of both the mr duffy and the fictional mr macgyver an important innovation skill overcoming the human propensity to hypnotized by current reality a thinking box called fixity whereby it is difficult to imagine any object outside of its functional fixity is a kind of of the mind psychological phenomenon that demonstrates how the more familiar we with an object or tool the more we see that object or uses a hammer stays a hammer and a blender stays a blender they become an emergency can opener or in the business world this type of psychological straightjacket up as an inability to imagine new uses for the products and created or new applications for the tools and processes we every unchecked it leads to statements like the way this works the way we do things around it also enthrones the expert or the experienced ones as arbiters of what is possible and what is not possible which for organization is the road to total paralysis and this kind of or spell can and must be broken if ideas are to be generated and in the brainstorm sessions i facilitate i break this spell asking participants to perform a simple exercise i give them the of coming up with as many possible uses of a ball as they imagine in three with nothing on the line and no identification with the object hand it becomes easy for people to generate alternative uses necklaces tiny boats toys packing material mobiles christmas decorations kermit the eyes then i ask people to come up with alternative uses for their products services or what people notice is that harder to generate multiple uses for something they are very familiar with in other words are bound by functional having done the ping pong ball exercise just minutes before people become much more able to expand their thinking horizons and everyday objects in a new maybe data collected via a particular manufacturing process can be somewhere else in the organization maybe a core competency in plastic can be used in another line of business maybe there are markets for a flagship once freed from functional fixity our creativity expands we have choices and more freedom to my invitation to for the next seven days notice the functional fixity in yourself you go about your daily routines then look for alternative uses of objects all around you see how many new ways you can use household items elastic bands forks or your favorite then consider your product or service ask how else could this product or service be used what need might it or look at your own skills and ask how can i use these skills to others in

note was if you respect yourself he asked how can you respect or your customers suppliers or the earth a person who himself is guided by there it was again the word i glanced a man got up and awkwardly sidestepped his way to the aisle then woman i stayed put principle we must forgive every mistake he explained but only once cannot make the same mistake at hublot geneve monday was the day for sharing mistakes and every mistake shared employees received a bonus the result got used to sharing mistakes and everyone got the benefit of forgiveness he said smiling is an act of bold this man was talking about love at a global business of people who controlled billions of dollars he was not talking metrics or social media or roi and i was loving in my experience love is at the core of any

deliverables and the chance to be guessing the word love come up too often in their staff meetings but maybe it if people act from love biver explained then they are a company with this kind of

corporate innovation initiatives innovation is in these days the word is on the lips of every ceo cio and anyone else with a acronym after their as a result many organizations are launching all kinds of initiatives hoping to stir the creative soup this is but it is also all too often a disappointing innovation initiatives sound good but usually live up expectations the reasons are many what follows are of the common organizational obstacles observed that get in way of a company truly raising the bar for see which ones are familiar to you then sit down with your team ceo innovation committee or best friend and jump start process of going beyond these reasons why most corporate innovation initiatives innovation framed as an initiative not the normal way of absence of a clear definition of what innovation really innovation not linked to existing vision or no sense of workforce is suffering from initiative ceo does not fully embrace the no compelling vision or reason to

past assumptions and old mental no process in place for funding new not enough pilot programs in senior team not walking the no process for managing too many turf wars too many analysis reluctance to cannibalize existing products and nih not invented here funky channels of no intrinsic motivation to unclear gates for evaluating mind numbing unclear idea pitching lack of clearly defined innovation

insightful from the world innovation i caught andrew excellent presentation at the innovation forum last week in nyc in which he focused on how can use environmental sustainability as a driver of this green to gold movement has been spurring innovation and profits across a wide range of industries in recent years simply trying to decrease waste and environmental along the way andrew who is the author of green recovery with daniel esty the book green to gold got into one of favorite subjects he offered a series of corporate innovation of what he called and what i call one perfect example of thinking is what shipping did in their efforts to decrease their maersk a dutch company is the biggest container line they asked themselves an odd and challenging question does shipping company always need to go by pursuing that seemingly absurd question they realized that if decreased the speed of their vessels they could save up of their fuel costs and by merely scheduling and planning their ships still arrived on time when their clients expected them a little closer to home trucking of new jersey had a by simply reducing the maximum speed of their trucks from mph to mph they now save million a year and in this economy difference between making a profit or ups and now fedex as well had another kind of head slapper they realized that in big cities like new york chicago and angeles their truck drivers used up a lot of gas wasted a lot time and got into a lot of accidents when their trucks had to left turns and got stuck all too often waiting at red so they asked themselves the seemingly bizarre question do trucks really have to make left their conclusion they by their routes in busy city downtowns and their ups devices to avoid left turns they incredible amounts of time and fuel not to mention having traffic ups now saves three million gallons of gas and million miles year by only making right similarly the folks at scott paper asked themselves why do we cardboard tubes to package our toilet paper what they realized they they now have a line of toilet paper which also saves of money and the so the question i and andrew have for you is this how can company use environmental sustainability as a catalyst for and even more to the point what powerful and challenging questions can you ask yourself that might provoke a head slap moment a flash of because

year old impossible math a few months ago year old shouryya ray blew the mind mathematicians and the media by solving two unsolvable dynamics problems first posed by isaac newton years how did he do explained shouryya when it was explained to us that the problems no solutions i thought to myself no harm in little smiley generations of scientists and mathematicians had tried their unsuccessfully at solving problem for the technically the problem was coming up with a mathematical formula to predict fluid dynamics of a flying object taking into account the of forces including gravity and air that was until shouryya was on a school trip to university and heard the professors mention the problem and saying was hearing this shouryya said why not i believe there be a so he got to work on it and give up until he had solved and published his does he think it was genius that got him there no in fact almost i think it was just schoolboy food for thought name three things in your business or life that written off as now like shouryya believe it busy take a fresh look at the problem trust your instincts contemplate if you need to get your creative juices flowing try the problem shouryya let be the position of a particle at time t let g be acceleration due to gravity and c the constant of friction solve differential subject to the constraint that is always opposite direction to finding the general solution to this differential equation will the general solution for the path of a particle which has proportional to the square of the velocity and opposite in an explanation how

become skillful at innovating what i do but that was only half actually less than half much if one thing learned these past years of working as innovation provocateur this mindset not skillset the name of the game in business these days no matter what the or lack when a mindset ie receptivity curiosity enthusiasm focus is in the right place skillset becomes is acquiring new skills useful of

is a worst a collector of best practices i like to find out what thinking individuals and organizations have done to extraordinary sometimes i share these stories in my keynotes or invariably my stock rises when i tell these stories people think know stuff they get giddy they take notes they think about how adapt these best practices to their but then things get people start becoming satisfied with emulating other instead of thinking up their own best practices they imitate the spirit of innovation gets replaced by the religion of gone is reflection gone is the process of discovery gone is ownership that comes with birthing new insights in simulation imitation and all too often the blind following not saying there value in paying attention to other best practices there but when when imitation replaces creation something invariably lost and innovation eventually goes down the idea my posted by mitch ditkoff at pm comments june reasons why creative people like to work in ever since i was old enough to realize there would never be a want in a newspaper that described a job i wanted loved working cafes i never really thought much about it until a few days ago when baffled friend of mine asked why i was so into his assumption that working in a cafe would be a distraction distraction dude quite the and so at the risk of trotting out a few conclusions my critics will have a field day trashing here reasons why you like to work in a it feel like a nice break from the you have an easy access to if you have a home office you appreciate the fact that in a there are no interruptions from your rarely think they are interrupting you when they stick their head your office and begin their conversation with something like interrupting you am the act of going from your office to a cafe gets the creative you get a whole bunch of unexpected inputs that change perspective for the moment ie snatches of conversation songs on radio odd posters on the there are no distracting tasks to default to ie cleaning desk filing tossing paper clips over the cubicle the people in your office want you to talk in hushed tones and a need for you to appear busier than you really being waited on by the cafe staff puts you in the mode of coming to you without much you focus on your most creative it feels good being part of a community even if the disbands after your third old patterns are interrupted new patterns you like the authenticity of your responses when the geek at next table peeking up from his mac asks what working like having a focus group at your beck and call you can anyone for their opinion and give it no strings if you work at home just a matter of time before your asks you to move a piece of furniture or clean the it brings out the artist and

immersed in the act of hatching mommy sitting in one place for a looooooooong time and baby chick is sitting curled up in one place for a looooooooong at google employees are given of their time to immerse in that have nothing seemingly to do with their day job at wl gore gives employees a half a day each week to in projects that fascinate look at your calendar block out some time to focus on the of your most inspired idea or venture unplug incubate tolerate breakthrough ideas are not always the result of a revolutionary moment on the contrary they are often the result of an series of approximations or failed when thomas edison was asked how it felt to fail times coming up with tungsten as the filament for the light bulb his was a revealing fail he said i fail once i learned times what edison had the ability to tolerate ambiguity to not know most breakthrough thinkers he had the ability to dwell in the zone confusion was not his confusion explained henry miller is simply a word we have for an order that is not yet if you are attempting to birth a breakthrough idea get with discomfort give up your addiction to having all your ducks in row at least in the beginning of your discovery people may think a quack but so what your chances of a breakthrough idea and result exponentially increase the more are able to tolerate what new idea of yours is bubbling on the brink of breakthrough what ways can you stay with it even if something in you is for a make new true creativity rarely happens in a vacuum on the contrary it is product of two or more variables connecting in a new it happens all of the time in nature water for example is just the connection between hydrogen and it happens in the human realm as well roller blading is nothing than the connection between ice skating and roller skating nothing more than the connection between music and television drive banking car the originators of these breakthrough products pull rabbits of hats all they did was see a new intriguing and commercial connection between already existing why more of us make these kinds of because we usually stay within the confines of what we already know live in a box of our own creation whether that box be defined by nationality profession concepts cubicle or astrological the more we are willing to get out of this box the more likely it be that powerful new connections will reveal themselves to us uncommon linkages between this that and the other thing kind the way it was for johannes gutenberg when he noticed a undetected connection between the wine press and coin and so the printing press was make three parallel lists of ten words the first list nouns second list verbs the third list adjectives then look intriguing new connections between in gary kasparov the soviet union grand chess master played two game match against deep blue the reigning supercomputer of time kasparov won when asked by the media what his competitive advantage was he two things intuition and the ability to fantasize and this from master strategic few of us are ever encouraged to fantasize a behavior most associated with children or and yet fantasizing is exactly how many breakthrough ideas get start by some maverick flake or dreamer entertaining the i find it curious that business leaders want their employees to come with fantastic ideas or solutions but they want their to fantasize and yet the words fantastic and fantasy come the same linguistic root meaning to use the think of a current challenge of yours what would a fantasy solution this challenge look like what clues does this fantasy solution define the right not that they find the solution said gk chesterton renowned american philosopher and writer they find most people in their rush to figure things out rarely spend time framing their challenge in a meaningful way if they owned a fail to take the time to program in their destination they were so much into the hustle of getting out of coming up with the right question is at least half of getting the if you want a breakthrough idea begin by coming up with a question one that communicates the essence of what trying state your most inspired challenge or opportunity as a beginning with words how can i then write it five different which is your real listen to your if you study the lives of people who have had eureka moments note that their breakthroughs almost always came after periods of intense conscious they worked they struggled they noodled they gave up recommitted then the breakthrough came and often at they buying lottery tickets at their local deli hoping to a breakthrough fortune they were digging for treasure in their back rene descartes got the idea for the scientific method in a richard wagner got the idea for das rhinegold while stepping onto a after long months of creative despair einstein used to thought experiments a fancy name for daydreaming whenever he in other words the conscious mind works overtime in an attempt solve a problem or achieve a unable to come up with the breakthrough the challenge gets turned to the subconscious mind which then proceeds to figure it out in own sweet of course all of this assumes that we are listening to the of our subconscious this week keep a log of your most inspired ideas intuitions dreams at the end of the week review your log see what insights to take a if you want a breakthrough you will need to take a break innovators rarely follow the straight and narrow path not only do march to a different drummer often not even on the playing field as most take seymour cray for example the legendary designer of he used to divide his time between building the next generation computer and digging an underground tunnel below his chippewa explanation of his tunnel digging behavior is consistent the stories of many other creatives people who understand the need to go whenever they get bottom line whenever they find themselves struggling with a problem they walk away from it for a while they know from years experience that more ie obsession analysis effort is often ie ideas solutions explained cray i work for three hours and then get stumped so i and go to work in the tunnel it takes me an hour or so to dig inches and put in the boards you see up in the wisconsin and there are elves in the woods so when they see me leave they back into my office and solve all the problems having then i go to my lab and work some next time you find yourself stuck on a thorny problem or project away from it for a while stay conscious of new solutions coming to during this down notice and challenge patterns and there are many people these days who make their living from the recognition business futurists meteorologists air controllers and stock brokers just to name a and while their success rates may not always be it is clear whatever success they enjoy is intimately tied to their ability notice patterns and then interpret those patterns correctly for rest of the same holds true for breakthrough the only difference breakthrough thinkers often hit the gravy train challenging old patterns and then reconfiguring them in new the act of creation said picasso is first of all an act the genius said american painter ben shahn is merely the one to detect the pattern amidst the confusion of details just a sooner than the average what trends in the marketplace most intrigues you in what ways these trends shift in the coming years and how might your inspired idea be in sync with this imagined hang out with a diverse group of years ago sony used to insist that their engineers spend at least of their work time out of the office and mixing it up with outside of the four walls of their keepers of the innovation flame at sony understood that diverse were essential to the origination and development of unfortunately most of us tend to stay within the intellectual of the familiar we hang out with the same people day and night usually people who either agree with us report to us or through indefinable act of karma are joined to us at the if you want to increase your chances of getting a breakthrough you will need to break the bonds of the hang out with a different crowd go beyond the usual suspects seek input of oddballs mavericks outcasts or at the very least outside your if you can let go of your need for comfort and agreement you will yourself catapulted into new ways of seeing thinking and acting all precursors to breakthrough make a list of ten people outside of your traditional posse that can spend some time with this month first breakthrough thinkers are often rugged individualists they believe their inalienable rights to think for themselves they value opinions their perspectives and their innate creativity biggest fear is group think all well and but there is an important distinction to be made between group and the phenomenon of inspired individuals getting together to each indeed most great breakthroughs are more about inspired than they are about lone wolf think bill gates and paul allen microsoft steve jobs and wozniak apple sergey brin and larry page google david filo jerry yang yahoo watson and crick dna lennon and mccartney beatles hewlett all you need to do is frame a meaningful question invite the people and facilitate the process for helping your think creatively jam if you are not the right person to facilitate probably know someone who is ask what is the topic of your next group brainstorm who will you who will facilitate look for happy breakthrough ideas are often less about the purposeful act of new things that it is the art of noticing new things that accidentally those surprise moments when the answer is revealed no particular the discovery of penicillin for example was the result of fleming noting the formation of mold on the side of a petri dish unattended overnight vulcanized rubber was discovered in charles goodyear accidentally dropped a lump of the polymer he was experimenting with onto his cook breakthroughs always about inventions but about intervention required to notice something new unexpected for this to happen you will need to let go of your expectations assumptions and get give up being an expert let go of the past see with new what failed experiment or unexpected outcome might be interesting you to use creative thinking i live in the northeast in the winter common for old cars especially on very cold mornings not to start when this the best thing you can do is get a jump start all you need are cables and another car got its motor creative thinking techniques are like jumper cables they ignition they turn potential into kinetic energy they get you when if looking for a breakthrough idea perhaps all you need is jump that jump start could take many shapes it could be a classic thinking technique of which there are many it could be a thinking coach or a favorite book or a ultimately it matter what medium you choose just as long you choose something to get your motor something to get you suspend perhaps einstein said it best when he declared not everything can be counted counts and not everything that counts can be he was referring of course to the part of the human being that intuitively the part that is tuned in connected and kids live in this place the rest of us just visit preferring world of rationality logic linearity and on some primal level all from missouri we need proof and there is nothing inherently wrong with gathering data the addiction it subverts our ability to originate breakthrough we know why we go to the movies the pub watch tv read novels numbers and we seek an altered state one that is free of the normal gravity daily why movie makers ask us to suspend disbelief brainstorm facilitators ask us to suspend judgment why innately intuitive as they are ask the men in their lives to being so damn practical for a change and actually feel it is in this state of suspension that our innate creativity is free percolate to the surface over under and around all of the brained guardians at the and so if you want to really birth a breakthrough idea you too need to enter into this state at least in the first phases of new venture suspend judgment suspend evaluation suspend addiction to the what exists on the other side is fuel for the fire of your what can you do this week to suspend practicality logic rationality in service to birthing your big into to our creative thinking innovation idea creative thinking posted by mitch ditkoff at am

your heart is the commandments for visiting a spiritual do not change the way you most visitors to a spiritual retreat think they have to change the they walk if they are truly going to have a meaningful somehow they believe there is a direct correlation between the they move their feet and the amount of grace or blessings about enter their the spiritual walk is actually a cousin of museum walk the curious way a person slows down and knowingly yet humbly past a monet or is it a manet getting the essence of the masterpiece even as they move towards that incomprehensible cubist piece in

spiritual walk should be taken in sandals though or chinese slippers will do in a pinch cowboy boots are out as are galoshes high heels and chuck taylor converse do not under any circumstances succumb to the spiritual closely related to the spiritual walk the spiritual nod is practiced in retreats the world over and while no one comprehends divine origins many believe it began when a brother simply forgot the name of his roommate on his way to instead of issuing the familiar sanskrit phrase of the week friend simply tightened his lips looked at the and well now every time you walk by someone at the ashram you to flash them the nod the equivalent of i know you know and you know i know and you know that i know that know and in my knowing i know that i know you know and by knowing need not speak since words are finite and cannot express knowingness which the two of us being one share from such a place know what i do not judge anyone including this is the hardest of all commandments to obey why because environments not only bring out the best in people they also bring the worst and while the worst is often more difficult to detect the bliss of people wanting you to notice how blissful they are higher you get the easier it is to notice that is if you looking for of course it would be very easy to spend your entire retreat noticing all the subtle ego trips going on around you this temptation with all your do not i repeat do not focus on the stuff that would make material for this article you have no right in fact you absolutely no idea why anyone is there what their motivation is how they will learn the kinds of lessons you are absolutely sure need to in reality you are most likely seeing your own projections disowned parts of your self that refused to acknowledge these your spiritual groupie your brownie point collector your junkie more experience your suburban yogi your guilty seeker of god con man your eunuch your resolution maker your ass watcher closet fanatic your glutton for humble pie your too poetic definer ecstasy your flaming bullshit artist your your bower towards anyone with more than all of them are you every single one of them judge them them bring them tea rub their feet every chance you do not think that this is the only place where it is spiritual retreatants have a marked propensity to think that grounds they inhabit are somehow more blessed than any place else earth that they are privy to a special command performance by revealing himself in thousands of exotic ways for those lucky enough be there while thousands nay millions of george souls stumbling around in uncool places recently vacated by the power of so a very cosmic thing can happen here and only here this life in fact is often perceived as so good in the center that rest of the world becomes eerily cast as the booby indeed to new age seekers everything else is simply referred to the world much like manhattanites speak of new jersey in short new age retreat comes to represent all that is good about god the guru about life somehow and i know how but you could ask anyone who was this weekend flowers seem sweeter there the moon seems fuller air seems cleaner even the bread tastes better if you glimpse shooting star at night the grace if you see a rainbow directly over the meditation i guess all in how you look at it the same

gonna win of the next and bring the pennant home to what do the signs in the sky or what we perceive as signs mean the whole world our ashram the real issue one appreciating what is happening all around us the flowers the the beggars asking for spare flowers any sweeter on retreat our willingness to deeply and enjoy them different stopping us from in this place right now stopping us from realizing that very ground beneath our feet is the promised land wherever we to be at the put a red dot on your forehead if you want unless been living in a trailer park your whole life probably already know what the red dot thing is all about right the third eye the sixth chakra high holiness india sometimes mistaken for a beauty mark or a random bit of watermelon little red dot is actually a useful reminder to focus on the space between the eyebrows which for some people is where lives or if not lives at least nothing wrong with now is still you have to concede that the third eye the only spot the human body sacred what about the earlobes the button the nipples they come from god too not too mention and the highly center of consciousness at crown of the head sacred every one of you think that if the body is the temple of the soul it that our entire physical structure is sacred we be from head to toe with little red dots and if so why is it that routinely quarantine people with measles the very people who selflessly chosen to manifest disease just to remind us to honor ultimate play with the the only sentient beings free from the collective mentality spiritual seekers are the children children visiting holy places fact behave the same way the world over no matter what their elders use for the unspeakable name of god when they eat when tired they sleep they cry when they want laugh for no reason consume ice cream without guilt and rarely why your picture of the master is bigger newer or better fart at your own if you fart and no one around to hear it at the ashram did happen and if it did happen does that mean been is the resident guru able to hear you and if he or she is out of the country or dead is their guru or their guru able hear you and if so so what will you be reborn as a gerbil does guru fart and if ok for him or her to pass wind why not ok so their place and a guest but after all all guests here even the guru who do they answer to and if the same one answering to what the hell are you doing up at five in the morning and sitting in the lotus maybe the real question whether or not permissible to on holy ground but how you fart for instance if farting of a blatant disregard for the teachings or the sincerity his or her followers you might want to reconsider where from however if your farting is just a random release of gas give yourself the benefit of the doubt you see a typical visit to spiritual center quickens ability to let go so what you farting may in fact be a timely sign of your evolving do not think you are higher or lower than anyone one of the favorite pastimes of people visiting a spiritual retreat comparing themselves to everyone else see the guy over there firewood a very old soul way older than me been on the for years and that dude laughing hysterically in the corner shiva oops he can probably see through me maybe i better walk the other want to save yourself some time try to figure out how on path anybody else is impossible stare into the eyes all want watch for signs of liberation but when it comes down to it the only conclusion reach will be your own that may have absolutely nothing to do with the anything but your face it how accurate is your assessment going to be when percent humanity tell that the carpenter from galilee had special going for indeed not at all unlikely that the visitor you met this morning at the ashram is at this very being treated like a spiritual mongoloid by everyone who meets repeatedly being asked if this is your first time when in the visitor is actually the reincarnation do not think that you are going to get many people visit a a spiritual retreat because they want to something they want clarity or contentment enlightenment grace blessings or peace of mind at the very least they their business to improve or their marriage to be alas they miss the point completely if you try to get you will left only with the sinking feeling of having just bought worth lottery tickets only to learn that some electrician from staten just won the whole look really very simple you go to a spiritual center or big time teacher for that matter to get you go to give to let go to relax your grip on the very thing been separating you getting all these years your grasping your fear your strategy to realize do not feel compelled to change your ok so your name is joey ever since you were knee high to a jar cheese whiz everyone called you joey as in joey down yeah you grew up in brooklyn school once a week and dated a chick named angela with very big great so here you are at the ashram and you run smack into bunch of dudes with names like arjuna govinda hey you think to yourself maybe they got something i guess what they do they have spiritual names given to them by guru names that make their mothers somewhat around canasta table and while these names are clearly given with a the fact of the matter is they are irrelevant do you think people in india who have spiritual experiences get their names to eddie gino stacey or shirley hey what difference does it make you are not your name even your namesake was enlightened it matter what they

short of cash a problem not for the mr fields simply created a blue ocean for himself in atlantic city one summer as a professional how it several times a day fields would swim out to sea pretend to drowning and then be rescued by one of his accomplices invariably a large crowd would gather on the beach as the no struggling actor was once it was clear that this poor fellow was going to live the

extraordinary so what is idea our innovation posted by mitch ditkoff at pm comments june out of the box in the copy of bar mitzvah today is the anniversary of my death in his memory i you a different kind of post today not about thinking outside box about the last day before being put in the box last taken work done i dedicate this to those of you whose father is alive that you might savor every day with him while you have there is a time of life when the time of life is about to end time of last breaths the time of saying goodbye to everything you ever known or loved the time of letting this is the time my father now finds himself he is flat on his back in a hospital bed but the hospital bed is his bedroom in west palm beach which is where he has chosen to die and there will be no more calls to no more paramedics no more transfusions no needles no pills no tests this is his death bed we are around it me his son his daughter my sister my his grandchildren great grandchildren and the present hospice nurse here to keep him as comfortable as his mouth is dry he cannot swallow someone swabs his lips as gathers left of his strength to move his tongue toward precious few drops of the sound track for his last night on earth is an oxygen pumping purified air through transparent tubes clipped to the end his on the counter creams creams for this and creams for that creams for the other thing too never seen so many those of us around his bed are very still holding his hand his back looking at him and each other in ways we have never there is very little for my father to do but breathe this lion of man whose life was defined by ferocity and action is barely moving a turn of the head a flutter of the eye a though his eyes are closed i know he can hear so i bend closer talk into his good right ear i tell him done a good job and all of us will be ok i tell him i love him and to go to the light tell him everything is fine and he can let the hospice nurse is monitoring his vital signs they keep lower and lower i touch my cheek and it is cooler before his skin looks translucent almost like a he opens his eyes and shuts them once again none of us around him what to do but ok because clear there is nothing to being is the only thing happening my father had his last shot of morphine about an hour ago he had last bowl of cheerios yesterday at am cheerios and half of a banana that was the last time he could it is quiet in the room very i see my sister my nieces my wife the nurse all of us are helpless as my father the only difference is we are if only we could pay as much attention to the living as we do to dying if only we could stop long enough from whatever occupies time and truly care for each other aware of just how precious breath is each word each touch each sitting by my side i am of everyone who the room the way they approach his bed what they say how they it the look on their face their i want to be this conscious all the time attuned to the impact i on others in everything i do it all nothing has prepared us for this moment not the books on death dying not the stories of friends fathers have gone before the sage counsel of the one thing is clear each of us will get our turn our bodies rusty old cars gone beyond their warrantees will wear out friends family will gather by our side speak in hushed tones hold our and ask if we are just the way it is it begins with a breath the first ends with a breath the in between a length of time a span of years a hyphen as teacher likes to say between birth and what this hyphenated experience will be is totally up to will it be filled with kindness love compassion gratitude delight will we be there for each other before time to fill the forms and watch the body strapped to a stretcher by two men black suits be driven away like something i hope so i really do i hope we all choose wisely i hope beyond shadow of a doubt before we walk through the shadow in the valley death that we choose to hold each hands now rub each backs bring each other tea and listen from the heart with the kind of infinite tenderness we too often reserve only for those to my father is very quiet now breathing only every seconds or so should i say being and thenthere is nothing only silence no breaths come no changes of expression on his face no whispered words of we around his bed are in his home but he is somewhere bye bye daddy travel well know that we love you and will keep flame of who are deeply alive in our hearts thank you for we will meet again on posted by mitch ditkoff at pm comments june how to create an idea one of the reasons why most big ideas go nowhere is because the originators do not have a team of collaborators on board to develop and execute their in the absence of collaborators the idea originators either try to everything themselves not a good idea or spend so much time trying enroll people on the fly that the idea loses momentum and simply put easy to conceive harder to deliver the but what if each of us who comes up with a potentially idea already had a team of collaborators in place people who poised and ready to respond with enthusiasm skill and this is not a new idea there are examples in many other domains teams firefighters and emergency rooms just to name a these are people who are there when you need them they are they know their roles they are team players and they are committed even when tired cranky and you need something similar every time you come up with a big idea maybe not every time but at least here are the people i want in my idea factory or as one renamed it my opportunity brainstorm buddy to help develop the idea give feedback insights and keep me on my researcher to gather information best practices data finance person to do projections budgets and help build business marketing maven to help me sell the idea in house and out in the real writer to create proposals business cases and other five people it on call part the the big idea comes to you write a brief and email it to your fab on a conference call you present the idea and get you make specific requests to each member of the you stay in close touch with all idea factory cohorts making to share info progress changes and anything forgotten any members of the team i should or are you ready to start your own idea ps these do not have to be paid positions

cost of the base model and then adds on the navigation entertainment systems that person be and when finds out the costs of the added service special coating and fancy rims still no so what got the buyer excited enough to get off the couch and go the suv dealer what was so the big secret people pay money for the stuff they they pay money for what the stuff represents the idea behind the above advertisement is designed to embed the idea into the mind the consumer that he or she upon buying the suv will nature rugged adventure freedom and the conquest of the now worth quite a lot you think especially if the actually have to do anything but buy the vehicle to achieve why risk snake bites ticks and bears when you can have what you without ever having to be uncomfortable the idea of nature and furthermore all a person needs to know is that the idea can achieved most people are happy with their purchase even if original idea is never played the bottom line for salespeople is this focusing on the stuff are selling is secondary a massive misstep that salespeople make lot a waste of time because buyers are mainly paying money the idea of what can be achieved or experienced once they possess thing they are in other words people are buying a means not an so stop selling stuff and start selling with ideas you have to sell at all just get out of the ideas if they are compelling

positive most high level executives do not expect a lot of recognition others neither do they give a lot of recognition to many managers are like the classic husband who when his wife that he tell her he loves her any more responds that he her he loved her when he married her and would have let her know anything had similarly most managers act as if the act of hiring an employee recognition enough this in spite of the fact that every one of managers wants to be valued and appreciated by their superiors and regularly disappointed by the lack of appreciation coming their in workplace there is a great fear that only the extraordinary achievements warrant recognition and that all just performance is merely what should be expected and does not require special the fear most have that excessive recognition will the praise they give and reduce future motivation for peer to peer the data of course indicates acknowledgment of good performance increases the probability of good performance and specificity of feedback telling people what you liked about what they did and why you liked it increases the likelihood of that performance occurring the bottom if we can get to a place where we are more generous and specific in expression of our positive feedback we will notice in time dramatic increase in the quality of performance and overall satisfaction with barry posted by mitch ditkoff at

skilled brainstorm facilitator knows how to orchestrate creative output from a seemingly dissonant group of people in conductor mode the facilitator includes everyone evokes even subtlest contributions from the least experienced participant demonstrates their commitment to the whole by offering timely to anyone who gets lost in their own a good brainstorm facilitator is able to transmute lead into or in modern terms knows how to help people get the lead this talent requires an element of wizardry the ability to without looking feel without touching and intuitively know within each brainstormer lives a hidden genius just waiting to get light on their feet brainstorm facilitators move gracefully the process of sparking new ideas able to go from the to polka to the whirling dervish spinning of a brainstorm group fire savvy facilitators take bold steps when necessary even there is no visible ground underfoot the path is made by walking it is their mad skillful brainstorm facilitators are bold experimenters often on the crazed but grandfatherly look of an einstein in heat respecting the realm of logic and the rational the ground upon most scientists build their homes the enlightened facilitator willing to throw it all out the window in the hope of triggering happy accident or a quantum leap of thought indeed it is these discontinuous moments that produce the kind breakthroughs that logic can only describe never elicit diamond fully recognizing the precious gem of the human imagination as well the delicacy required to set it free the high octave facilitator is a craftsman or craftswoman par excellence precise and dedicated able to get to the heart of the matter in single stroke without leaving anything or anyone damaged in brainstorm facilitators are on stage whether they like it or not eyes are upon them as well as all the potential critical humanly possible more often than not the will only be moved to act perchance to dream if they believe facilitator is completely into his or her role if the audience not suspend this kind of disbelief the play will close early everyone will be praying for a fire drill or wishing they were home eating a grilled cheese brainstorm facilitators are the original recyclers in their pursuit of possibility they look for value in places other people as useless to the facilitator in full mojo mode bad always bad only curious indicators that something of value is lurking officer of the one of the brainstorm most important jobs is to law and order once the group gets roaring down the open highway the imagination this is a fine art for in this territory is encouraged as is running red lights jaywalking and breaking and entering just as thieves have their code of however so too should brainstormers indeed it is the task to keep this code intact a task made infinitely easier by ritual declaration of ground rules at the start of a some brainstorm facilitators intoxicated by the group energy and own newly stimulated imagination use their position as a way to their ideas on others or worse manipulate the group into their of thinking oops ouch aargh brainstorm facilitating is a not a personal platform it is supposed to be a selfless act enables others to arrive at their own solutions no matter different they may be from the humor is one of the brainstorm most important tools dissolves boundaries activates the right brain helps participants unstuck and shifts perspective just enough to help everyone open eyes to new ways of seeing trained facilitators are always on lookout for humorous responses they know that humor often signals of the most promising ideas and that giggles guffaws and frequently indicate a rich vein of possibility to humor also makes the facilitator much more likable which makes group they are facilitating more amenable to their direction wonder why the words aha and are so want to learn how to facilitate breakthrough brainstorming click our webinar posted by mitch ditkoff at am comments march why good leaders often the case that people expect their leaders to be decisive able to make difficult decisions quickly indeed this kind of is interpreted as one of the hallmarks of good the reality is different the rush to judgment mindset creates undue pressure on leaders kind of pressure that causes them to prematurely choose a path even when confronting a complex to be truly effective leaders need to balance the need to converge on a single solution with the conflicting requirement multiple perspectives be yes spending time to gain an understanding of the thought behind conflicting perspectives slows down the but it also creates a rich opportunity for much more robust slowing down is not necessarily a sign of procrastination indecision more accurately it is a sign of impending wisdom about be tolerating this period of pause requires leaders to exhibit qualities that seem to be in short supply these not patience not unfortunately as external pressures from above and below leaders experience an increasing tendency to internalize pressures causing stress and a relentless need to their the result leaders end up adopting solutions to the challenges at hand they decide fast but decisions they make are all too often fatally being able to resist mounting pressures to act quickly requires intestinal fortitude it requires leaders to keep themselves and passionately engaged in the process of finding a way through uncertainty instead of grasping at known solutions which only the problem this phenomenon is similar to the classic story of the drunkard for his car keys under a streetlight even though he knows where he dropped i know my keys there he confesses but where light not easy searching in the dark

steps forward to turn theory the challenge for them is the same as always been to find simple authentic way to address the challenge from the inside out to water the root of the tree not just the external systems and protocols no matter how seductive they are create are simply not sufficient to guarantee real innovation in words of oliver wendell holmes systems die instinct this is not to say that organizations should ignore systems structures in their effort to establish a culture of innovation but systems and structures all too often become the holy grail much in the same way that six sigma has become the holy unfortunately when the addiction to systems and structures rules day an quest for a culture of innovation into nothing much more than a cult of organizations do not innovate people innovate inspired fascinated people creative people committed people innovation originates from deep within the inspired individual understands that sustained effort is required to beyond the status samurai with the role just like the individual role is to get out of the way and while this getting out of the way undoubtedly include the effort to formulate supportive processes and protocols it is important to remember that processes and protocols are never the they are the context not the content they are the husk not they are the menu not the ultimately organizations are faced with the same challenge religions are faced with religious leaders may speak about the virtues their congregation needs to abide by but only name the challenge and remind people to experience something they necessarily change change comes from within the heart and mind of each individual cannot be legislated or evangelized into needed in organizations who aspire to a culture innovation is an inner change people need to experience within themselves that will spark and sustain their effort to and when they experience this something they will they will think about their projects in the shower in their car in their dreams they will need very little management from outside inside out will rule the day not outside in motivation will people will innovate not because they are told to but because want to open space technology is a good metaphor for this people are inspired share a common compelling goal and have the and space to collaborate the results become you can create all the reward systems you want you can reinvent workspace until blue in the face you can license the latest greatest idea management tool but unless each person in organization owns the need to innovate and finds a way to tap their own innate brilliance all end up with is a mixed bag systems processes and protocols the husk not the kernel innovation flotsam and jetsam that the next administration or next or next key stakeholder will mock reject or change at the drop of hat if the roi show up in the next you want culture change you want a culture of great then find a way to help each and every person in

themes surfaced again and the five regrets of the i wish had the courage to live a life true to myself not life others expected of this was the most common regret of all when people realize that life is almost over and look back clearly on it it is easy to see many dreams have gone unfulfilled most people had not honored even half of their dreams and had to die knowing that it was due to they had made or not made health brings a freedom very few until they no longer have i wish i worked so this came from every male patient that i nursed they missed youth and their companionship women also spoke this regret but as most were from an older generation many of female patients had not been breadwinners all of the men i deeply regretted spending so much of their lives on the treadmill of work i wish had the courage to express my many people suppressed their feelings in order to keep peace others as a result they settled for a mediocre existence and became who they were truly capable of becoming many illnesses relating to the bitterness and resentment they carried as i wish i had stayed in touch with my often they would not truly realize the full benefits of old until their dying weeks and it was not always possible to track down many had become so caught up in their own lives that they had golden friendships slip by over the years there were many deep about not giving friendships the time and effort that they everyone misses their friends when they are i wish that i had let myself be this is a surprisingly common one many did not realize until the that happiness is a choice they had stayed stuck in old patterns habits the of familiarity overflowed into emotions as well as their physical lives fear of change had pretending to others and to their selves that they

mine edwin clarified this challenge for me with a story about how he managed client base for mitsui i use an agricultural model called radishes wheat and trees puzzled i asked him to tell me what he he responded by asking me three have you ever met a guy with a million dollar deal who for i answered yes i happen to be working with someone like that then he said he may not be a bad guy with a bad deal he is just tree farmer who has nothing to eat while he waits for his trees to then he asked have you ever met a guy with a lot of money and soon after that has no money again and i answered yes in fact this describes me quite edwin went on this is not a bad guy just a wheat farmer goes from feast to then he asked have you ever met a guy who is caught up in a lot small projects but never seems to do anything yes i said again i know a lot of people like simple edwin continued they are just radish farmers with to eat but not much to show for i asked him what this all the smart farmer he explained plants all three he plants radishes that harvest every two to four weeks he also plants wheat the same time and waits six months to a year for it to come harvest he also plants trees at the same time and eats wheat radishes while he waits for his trees to bear fruit in to the smart farmer plants all three and always has something to i asked him how this applied to his client all about cultivation and timing he said smaller clients radishes and need a lot of cultivation some clients are and need more cultivation some are trees and need a lot he cultivation requires time energy conversation expenditures presentations and the like if you gave a tree the cultivation you gave a radish you would starve it if you gave radish the same cultivation you gave a tree you would drown you have to have the patience of a farmer he said farmers into their fields and yank on the plants to get them to grow they cultivate them they let them germinate and grow for clients that brought a big return it would take us a year or two to get in the door smaller clients take much less time energy i always made sure he explained that i had a good balance radishes wheat and trees in my portfolio of clients importantly i never gave them too much of what they need or little of what they did i never forgot words and have applied them in my business over years i have shared this story with clients more times that can in my consulting business i make sure my bills are paid by the clients clients that are very regular but tend to be smaller get me to my financial floor and pure my wheat clients are more project oriented they take care of unforeseen financial obstacles and opportunities that emerge they come and go on a recurring basis and ensure a level my tree clients are the

industries the products services of my clients have all been different as have acronyms mission statements and cafeteria but they all have one thing in common and that is a tendency to undervalue the power of sure they give out gold watches and employee of the month awards the simple act of acknowledging and appreciating each other on a basis is in woeful short the reasons are too many managers have come to believe that the expression appreciation will be counterproductive leading to workforce a workforce that will be entitled the perceived lack of time is another most plates are so full these days that the time and it takes to acknowledge another for their efforts is considered luxury that cannot be a third the majority of people who work in an organization do not know how appreciate others it is not shall we say their default why should this matter to your because there is a direct correlation between appreciation and the more appreciation the more morale improves and the more improves the more willing people are to go the extra indeed recent us department of labor data shows that the number reason people leave their jobs is that they do not feel when you quantify the cost

who when his wife complains he tell her he loves her any more responds that he told her loved her when he married her and he would have let her know anything had similarly most managers act as if the act of hiring an employee recognition enough and they would have let them know if this in spite of the fact that every one of these managers wants to valued and appreciated by their superiors and is disappointed by the lack of appreciation coming their there is a great fear that only the most extraordinary warrant recognition and that all just good or superior performance merely what should be expected and does not require any the fear is that excessive recognition will dilute the cheapen it and reduce future motivation for outstanding the data of course indicates mere acknowledgment of good performance increases the probability more good performance and specificity of feedback telling person exactly what you liked about what they did and why you liked dramatically increases the likelihood of that performance giving people clear targets increases the likelihood that those will be hit even if no incremental reward is associated with hitting a valued target is rewarding in if we can get to a place where we are more generous and specific in positive feedback we will notice a dramatic increase in the quality performance and overall satisfaction with barry posted by mitch

same way that quality circles were a big hit in the tanks ie appreciation circles might be exactly what the ordered for these difficult the idea is related to the practice of appreciative inquiry is not focused on improving organizational processes rather focuses on the moment of people appreciating each i realize that some business leaders will consider this a pursuit so be betting there are

man before heenehan was on board the program had focused on acumen and included traditional modules on ethics change and scenario the program was very popular and recognized as a hallmark event at chubb the challenge going forward to maintain its and help participants adapt to a radically changing and so heenehan decided to focus the program on business acumen innovation she wanted cbs participants no matter what function to think more but even more than that she wanted participants to be more proactive and committed to turning their top of the line ideas bottom line action not just astute veteran of the corporate world as she was heenehan knew program was going to need senior leadership support if it was going to get off the she wanted senior leaders to support and participate in program because they wanted to become an integral part of enter jon bidwell senior vp and chief innovation if anything was music to ears it was the fact that the business school was going to focus on innovation jon quite was on a personal crusade to increase the value and velocity innovation within the computer man on he recognized a golden opportunity collaborating with heenehan better connect all the competencies levels and geographies of company and to push ideas closer to market needs instead of being driven from we needed people to connect with each other earlier in the process explained bidwell innovation at chubb had to become than it had to become the way we do business on a bidwell and heenehan both agreed that the gap between theory practice had to be crossed not by

end of each session unlike most corporate training the impact of business school did not end when the week over no way things were just beginning to heat graduates of the program were invited to participate in the challenge which operated within innovation platform drive and lightbulb over innovation efforts moved through idea generation facilitation review and a series of pitches to surface the best ideas focused profitability and ideas selected by each of the idea teams then moved toward case development and potential presentation to venture team cbs participants soon found themselves presenting a case in board rebekah martin a graduate of the september training is familiar with the rebekah a senior cpi underwriter from chicago have ideas during her week of training but five later upon reviewing ideas newly posted on the idea intranet one particular idea that was very relevant to her relevant and she saw a new possibility and now that there was an online development process in place had a way to help midwife before she knew it rebekah had become part of a team to further develop the idea and soon thereafter prepare present that idea to senior management we had the right three people on the team explained so it take that much attention away from my day job at in march rebekah found herself at chubb the idea with one of her cohorts to some of the top thumb up through i was fairly new to the company at the time martin chuckled so know who all those people were or i might have been the presentation was open and relaxed response from leaders was quite positive and rebekah and her team quickly how much easier it was than they had assumed to be a vital part innovation today their idea a way to take better advantage of interactions with specific customers is funded and moving innovation pipeline along with several other winning that emerged from the chubb business currently six ideas have been funded through the venture fund one idea was funded through a regional program and five ideas been pitched directly to the strategic business unit for countless other ideas that were not selected for further within the cbs challenge are out there seeking support through or regional graduates of chubb business school explains bidwell come out the program with a deeper understanding of the mechanics of and how to stage the development of a new idea some chubb may think you go from an idea right to a page business document but not how it works all new ideas are works progress they need to be given a fair hearing aired out to developed and presented in a setting conducive to adds martin i learned a lot about chubb from this experience learned that i really do have a say in what gets developed and out the market i find it refreshing that chubb is actually interested my ideas and what i think my ideas have to be make a difference even the simple ones can make a the cbs program founder really proud of what created explains heenehan are very intrigued with it taken a good proven program taken it up several question mark in well says heenehan always trying to innovate within innovation program originally we had the three groups of participants competing against each other we thought it was a idea at first but later found it to be unnecessary all on same team after for the program we made some changes eliminating competitive aspect and allowed teams to function without competitive aspect this year going to be more targeted with assignments more collaborative during the actual cbs event continue raising the bar for

an open that helps us listen to multiple points of view without being ruled preconceived ideas and being curious enough to arrive at a deep understanding of what problem really consists of is a much

act of generating new in a group an activity that has come to be known as historically most people have believed that ideas come to them bolts from the blue flashes of inspiration that descend from beyond a dimension free of the laws of even the modern dictionary speaks of ideas as transcendent the implication of this way of thinking is that people need to highly attuned in order to attract new ideas becoming a kind channel through which ideas the importance of other people in this approach is thus the desire for many creative types to seek solitude moon and any number of artificial stimulants whatever it takes increase their chances of tapping into the exoteric source but there is another way to get ideas a way that does not solitude long walks opium or surprise visitations from the quite the this approach requires people committed people who come with a focused intention to collectively tap into the unknown and for want of a better word call this activity brainstorming the creative act by which exciting new ideas are generated through catalytic action of one mind upon or to put it more simply two heads are better than unfortunately the word brainstorming has become totally abused our culture like the phrase web it is applied to anything everything until it means absolutely meeting with friends to talk about a business deal tossing a few ideas around over

find been working on the wrong problem try doing it for five years what apple computer engineers did with the newton handheld over a decade from apple made a valiant effort to break open a market portable handheld pen computers unfortunately they spent most of time working on a problem that really exist for consumers as they labored at it their intended market was stolen by palmpilot what follows is a tale about a fatal assumption an obsession with big problem that led to one of silicon great product consider the moral solving a big problem mean solving the right team chose to tackle the biggest challenge in pen handwriting recognition newton would be the first computer people could write on directly using their natural hand scrawl the computer would extract the standard characters computers need to work with this posed a massive in pattern recognition since every handwriting is the newton would need to learn the particular way its user wrote letter and number if it got all the letters in say the word right newton would compare that string of letters to words in word native memory if the word thing was stored there would find a match and know the the newton team was determined to build the most pattern learning pen computer but why were they doing it and for here they made one fatal assumption about their potential buyer assumption that would seal the the assumption went something like users want to do things the way always done them the have to learn anything new to adapt to a machine a machine can and should adapt to the user in this case learn this assumption became a frame and the frame became a mindset ever turning back to question their customer premise labored to build a noble machine that could recognize diverse scrawls of any and every human on earth but was this the problem to when the newton message pad debuted in its recognition fell way short of the mark and a public drubbing the doonesbury comic strip showed a character writing a sentence on a the unit coughed up freckles then the simpsons piled on the world all through the newton was skewered in the press in october that year apple ceo john sculley left with freckled egg on his humiliated the newton team redoubled their efforts to solve their problem getting newton to learn at the heart of learning challenge was the problem each time a pen lifted off the tablet and set down brain detected a pause and became uncertain what that pause mean is this next stroke part of the current letter or new letter or word as it turns out many alphabet characters multiple strokes leaving plenty of room for uncertainty capital and x involve two strokes h needs three add user hesitancy writing quirks and you have a thorny problem and just try cyrillic or japanese because recognition engine was unsure so often routinely threw a list of possible words at the user this was inconvenient and embarrasing who wants their computer to say confused take time out scan these words and select the right worse if you wanted newton to learn a word outside its native word database you had to train it you first had to write it your then type it letter by letter using an keyboard all that tell newton this is what looks like when i write the upshot to save users from having to adapt their writing to machines the newton subjected ordinary people to drawn out repetitive clarification and training routines a tacit admission newton doing its core job none of this was lost on jeff hawkins inventor of the pilot who was carrying around a wooden block as a pretend pocket and using a whittled down chopstick as a pen to imagine his hawkins never lost sight of what consumers would want most in a computer fast writing and true mobility something they could fit their he cut to the chase and questioned must the computer learn everything why adapt why build a sophisticated learning machine at all get job done people learn faster than computers so why people the machine people could easily get the hang of a new alphabet hmm one stroke per character and presto no so what jeff hawkins did with his grafitti language he redesigned the alphabet turning letters and numbers symbols that mostly kept the look of the characters suddenly the computer had only one master rule to when the pen lifts up the character is done when the pen comes again a new character want to end a word one stroke makes space simple and while at it since each stroke is a character lets not even write along a line write letters on top each other in the same input space and let them display as type another presto a smaller solution made palm pen input good apple even licensed grafitti in as an input option for newton some say it kept the newton alive but the real power grafitti was size it shrank the screen which shrank the box created a viable in march when newtons were selling as digital writing for up to the first palmpilots debuted for a million of them sold in the first months the newton countered with a much improved newton and but by then it too late two years after the palmpilot was released apple the newton product line on february the project cost the company half a billion hawkins technology was a workaround it recognition in the mit sense but while may have grafitti was a cheat ordinary people not giving a hang about technology issues found palmpilots handy and useful while rallied around solving the big problem consumers swarmed to buy solution to the right problem which started with a chopstick and block of by year palm owned percent of pda sales and had sold well five million units at the peak of pda use white boards were covered with grafitti symbols which many considered faster write for the newton team spent five years working on the big problem and rewriting untold lines of code to create a learning machine for existing alphabet hawkins spent a few days designing a new any computer could easily despite its truly impressive interface newton stumbled at main task it promised to do turn writing into standard characters quickly and why did apple paint themselves into corner because they assumed consumers would want their handheld adapt to their personal way of writing instead of biting into big problem jeff hawkins assumed people would adapt as he once it it takes you weeks or months to learn how to type so why spend minutes learning how to talk to a computer with a the in hindsight underlying user assumptions made little what makes standard routine handwriting so sacred who people adapt to machines who said you had to work with existing english alphabet why make a program strain to recognize possible variant of every letter and number who said your program to recognize scrawled words by finding them in a limited word

reproduction rights blog linking are posted by tim moore at pm comments big problem or right problem the egg freckles have you ever spent hours trying to solve a problem only to find been working on the wrong problem try doing it for five years what apple computer engineers did with the newton handheld over a decade from apple made a valiant effort to break open a market portable handheld pen computers unfortunately they spent most of time working on a problem that really exist for consumers as they labored at it their intended market was stolen by palmpilot what follows is a tale about a fatal assumption an obsession with big problem that led to one of silicon great product consider the moral solving a big problem mean solving the right team chose to tackle the biggest challenge in pen handwriting recognition newton would be the first computer people could write on directly using their natural hand scrawl the computer would extract the standard characters computers need to work with this posed a massive in pattern recognition since every handwriting is the newton would need to learn the particular way its user wrote letter and number if it got all the letters in say the word right newton would compare that string of letters to words in word native memory if the word thing was stored there would find a match and know the the newton team was determined to build the most pattern learning pen computer but why were they doing it and for here they made one fatal assumption about their potential buyer assumption that would seal the the assumption went something like users want to do things the way always done them the have to learn anything new to adapt to a machine a machine can and should adapt to the user in this case learn this assumption became a frame and the frame became a mindset ever turning back to question their customer premise labored to build a noble machine that could recognize diverse scrawls of any and every human on earth but was this the problem to when the newton message pad debuted in its recognition fell way short of the mark and a public drubbing the doonesbury comic strip showed a character writing a sentence on a the unit coughed up freckles then the simpsons piled on the world all through the newton was skewered in the press in october that year apple ceo john sculley left with freckled egg on his humiliated the newton team redoubled their efforts to solve their problem getting newton to learn at the heart of learning challenge was the problem each time a pen lifted off the tablet and set down brain detected a pause and became uncertain what that pause mean is this next stroke part of the current letter or new letter or word as it turns out many alphabet characters multiple strokes leaving plenty of room for uncertainty capital and x involve two strokes h needs three add user hesitancy writing quirks and you have a thorny problem and just try cyrillic or japanese because recognition engine was unsure so often routinely threw a list of possible words at the user this was inconvenient and embarrasing who wants their computer to say confused take time out scan these words and select the right worse if you wanted newton to learn a word outside its native word database you had to train it you first had to write it your then type it letter by letter using an keyboard all that tell newton this is what looks like when i write the upshot to save users from having to adapt their writing to machines the newton subjected ordinary people to drawn out repetitive clarification and training routines a tacit admission newton doing its core job none of this was lost on jeff hawkins inventor of the pilot who was carrying around a wooden block as a pretend pocket and using a whittled down chopstick as a pen to imagine his hawkins never lost sight of what consumers would want most in a computer fast writing and true mobility something they could fit their he cut to the chase and questioned must the computer learn everything why adapt why build a sophisticated learning machine at all get job done people learn faster than computers so why people the machine people could easily get the hang of a new alphabet hmm one stroke per character and presto no so what jeff hawkins did with his grafitti language he redesigned the alphabet turning letters and numbers symbols that mostly kept the look of the characters suddenly the computer had only one master rule to when the pen lifts up the character is done when the pen comes again a new character want to end a word one stroke makes space simple and while at it since each stroke is a character lets not even write along a line write letters on top each other in the same input space and let them display as type another presto a smaller solution made palm pen input good apple even licensed grafitti in as an input option for newton some say it kept the newton alive but the real power grafitti was size it shrank the screen which shrank the box created a viable in march when newtons were selling as digital writing for up to the first palmpilots debuted for a million of them sold in the first months the newton countered with a much improved newton and but by then it too late two years after the palmpilot was released apple the newton product line on february the project cost the company half a billion hawkins technology was a workaround it recognition in the mit sense but while may have grafitti was a cheat ordinary people not giving a hang about technology issues found palmpilots handy and useful while rallied around solving the big problem consumers swarmed to buy solution to the right problem which started with a chopstick and block of by year palm owned percent of pda sales and had sold well five million units at the peak of pda use white boards were covered with grafitti symbols which many considered faster write for the newton team spent five years working on the big problem and rewriting untold lines of code to create a learning machine for existing alphabet hawkins spent a few days designing a new any computer could easily despite its truly impressive interface newton stumbled at main task it promised to do turn writing into standard characters quickly and why did apple paint themselves into corner because they assumed consumers would want their handheld adapt to their personal way of writing instead of biting into big problem jeff hawkins assumed people would adapt as he once it it takes you weeks or months to learn how to type so why spend minutes learning how to talk to a computer with a the in hindsight underlying user assumptions made little what makes standard routine handwriting so sacred who people adapt to machines who said you had to work with existing english alphabet why make a program strain to recognize possible variant of every letter and number who said your program to recognize scrawled words by finding them in a limited word engineers set up these problems not great

fantastic time an experience that wives no matter how wonderful they may be have never been able truly fathom our viewing behavior to them is a merely a parody the american male woefully predictable that assessment however was not my experience last night no way the contrary my experience was noble ecstatic tribal and beyond the pretzels popcorn chips and beer something else at the risk of making a mountain out of a football game allow me share a few observations about the experience and by extension experience of millions of men huddled together before the game in that sacred act of viewing nothing else was happening nada zilch no work no bills no back taxes no car repairs no in iraq no recession no primaries no relationship issues cholesterol no this and no that only the game pure

makes perfect sense of course starting with habit the commitment of top management but the fourth habit wendling calls secret weapon is often overlooked or ignored much of the time in organizations in words talk talk management at m has long encouraged networking and informal among its i think wendling calls this secret weapon because so few companies do this well or are even aware of its importance but could be more important to innovation than encouraging collaboration and teamwork we know lies behind every innovation the invention of the this is where the silo mentality and the not invented here intrudes on an innovation culture strict formal reporting loyalty to business unit before the organization and the tendency to only interact with people who already share our own and experiences all come into play any or all of these can block at least slow down many internal network of i tell you how many times facilitated a brainstorm at a major corporation when a proposed idea

tomaz no designing from within embedding service design the health julia schaeper lynne maher helen the national health service nhs is the national healthcare in the uk it is the fourth largest organisation in the world million people through a wide range of organisations hospitals general practise surgeries and ambulance services the is used by millions of people everyday who value its expertise staff and its ability to make them feel better it is often to as a yet at times it does not provide the service that it could to all of the people who need to use members only download the this results in inefficiencies safety issues a lack of personal and dissatisfaction to make things worse in the current climate it is suggested that the nhs will face its greatest challenge of its entire history a billion funding gap over next this means the need for strong leadership and productivity has never been greater time is short and experience previous spending crises tells us that failing to rise to challenge now will have serious consequences for the nhs its and staff work to deal with this unprecedented challenge is now with the support of nhs staff policy makers and the one ambition over the next years is to radically innovate within health system changing it so that it consistently provides choice more personalised care and more meaningful involvement of recipients of the service without doubt this is a bold ambition one that needs innovative tools techniques and methods to help succeed it is an ambition that in our opinion can benefit from some the tools techniques and methodologies found within the discipline of service by of course it has sometimes been a challenge to explain how methodologies can improve the delivery of public services as design council noted not so long ago design is a process but it is difficult to think of what problems it can help solve when all you really know about designers is that they make gadgets like ipods or will have created the graphics for attractive label on your tin of baked beans although still unknown as a discrete discipline or specialist profession design reflects the understanding that techniques which evolved the production lines of the th century can be applied not only products but also to fields from communications to business from sustainability to services in the wider public sector recent initiatives for example dott and the design programme public services by design have helped make clear service design can make a valuable contribution to tackling some of social and economic challenges we are facing today and in we are also beginning to see change as increasing numbers of experts have come to recognise the value of service design in terms offering a methodology for turning ideas into high quality results are and productive whilst delivering the experience for the patient within health policy development we seeing a tangible focus on personalisation of care and a higher of patient and carer involvement in designing health services operating framework for the nhs in england for instance set out everything we do must be geared towards improving the experience of nhs services and clinical outcomes of care this led health organisations like ours to seek out new ways of closely with patients to better understand their experiences redesign services to better meet their needs to do this we utilising service design as an improvement methodology and embedding the approach alongside existing embedding service design as a fundamental principle of how we at the nhs institute we started this journey by working with a of service designers who like nhs staff strive to things for we began to understand that design might be useful healthcare improvement work and that we could gain considerable from involving patients as well as healthcare practitioners in design process shaping services that meet the needs of those using delivering them most importantly we also began to understand expectations of healthcare as a an with a person or organisation from which you expect to gain clearly the nhs is such a service but it is one whose value traditionally been defined in terms of clinical outcomes and healthcare organisations have demonstrated that they can improve performance and reliability of services producing tangible changes how patients access care and how safe that care is these organisations have not always placed equal focus on how it feels to or be part of the service so we started to understand that health provision as a means considering the experience care for all users patients carers and staff and that we now the opportunity to focus on we first started to apply service design when we developed our very way of doing things inspired by service design and looking at other innovative organisations work we developed our own a systematic but flexible process we use to convert and ideas into new solutions that can make a real difference it us to take appropriate risks something at the heart of all while ensuring our end solutions are relevant fit for purpose actually wanted by staff and a core component of this new approach involved using tools from design sphere to bring new insight to the organisation for observation forms a core part of our own innovation process clearly observation is already a clinical tool brought a more anthropological approach to bear learning experiences and the context in which healthcare staff about their work another important principle drawn from service is that of the understanding that in order to healthcare we need to bring patients and staff much closer than we had previously done in order to see the problems from perspectives and to actively share the role of services we also found evidence for the need of outside the design world the national audit office for instance promotes role of customer insight in particular in healthcare situations suggest that to be successful innovative projects could only delivered by meaningfully involving service users and supporting nhs improvements through service in one instance the application of these techniques resulted patients nhs staff and designers making over changes to clinical pathway alone while the pathway in question had scored in a patient satisfaction survey our work revealed actual experience of the service fell short of the high implied by the survey result this helped us understand that there is fundamental difference between an overall service satisfaction and great experience and that working with satisfaction surveys alone simply not good in order to encourage widespread uptake of service design we have learnt from designers and some of the tools techniques internally having first designed our internal work we then created some programmes to support the nhs in capability capacity and confidence for example the ebd design the observation tool and the practitioner programme these products are designed to current nhs practise of starting improvement projects simply by straight to a solution instead we advocate spending time identify and delineate problems more systematically so as to be able then design a more appropriate effective while the private sector has used similar approaches for years tools and programmes are new for the nhs where they have been used the health service they have amazing results delivering the sort care pathways that leave patients feeling safer happier and valued whilst making staff feel more positive rewarded and however introducing approaches was not without challenges the greatest hurdle has been convincing healthcare staff the value that design can bring to their services we were often with the comment but designers design chairs design industry was not really considered an obvious partner to help our scientific world of health services there was also a language barrier between the two professions with new phrases such or and the use of highly communications being foreign to health workers equally the slang abbreviations used within the nhs culture were at times for service never before has the nhs needed innovation in service delivery in same way and clearly there is still a lot of work to be done believe that design thinking as an improvement strategy has potential to help many health organisations bring about change combination with other improvement methodologies we believe design helps pursue our prevailing political objectives personalisation participation and as well supporting the health priorities of quality innovation and prevention but it will take time to win acceptance from healthcare for the idea that service design can play a role in services and to ensure the continued spread and adoption of its and techniques in the nhs designers moving into the public sector start facing that challenge now helping to ensure that thinking and principles become part of the everyday work of service delivery the design profession needs to become recognised as having evolved beyond form giving and material into a sphere of making people and services more resourceful at the nhs institute we have the opportunity to look at things fresh eyes which means we can bring design in at an early stage encourage a dialogue before we develop any aspects of our work in detail by championing design techniques as an intrinsic part healthcare innovation we hope to support the development of more efficient services right when they are needed is it like to work as a service designer with the the traditional approach for public sector organisations would be commission service designers to undertake specific work increasingly the public sector is recognising the value of service design skills available at the nhs institute for innovation and improvement for instance initially commissioned design support but have more recently employed full time service designer as a core member of our innovation team whilst we continue to work with service designers some of our key programmes we also recognised that in order to a platform to expand service design to the nhs and the nhs to design we had to have our own institutional service design even so the role of the service designer within a health remains similar to working in a design consultancy clearly this is a new professional working context for the designer with new challenges and slightly different skill as with all service designers the job entails finding as well solving problems service designers still collaborative design processes enabling people to develop implement solutions together the job still requires expertise in a visual language for breaking down complexity and intangible relationships and interactions between people and the still demands the ability to create a more holistic picture all various elements together on a more strategic level to entire business but moving to the public sector requires adaptation to a very organisational culture for one working within an team of health experts former practitioners psychologists researchers means the service designer needs to quickly an understanding of the bigger picture and crucially political drivers and policies involved practical design work still to fit within the broader strategic objectives set out by government and has to be grounded in the specialised terminology in the healthcare sector if it is to remain engaged and relevant can be quite a challenge given that few designers have experience of the policy arena it is essential to have at least understanding of the culture and key issues faced in the secondly working means that the service designer has deploy their skills across a much wider scale of applications projects might range from working closely on the with a gp to improve aspects of a surgery or patient experiences working on a much more strategic level remodelling internal structures or translating the newest policy documents into opportunities for change facilitation skills enthusiasm and are crucial as it can take some time to gain acceptance for new and even so the internal design expert should remain a champion for application of design as an integral component of healthcare within the institute and wider nhs a large part of the work consist of finding solutions that build the capacity and capability innovate within healthcare providers as well as coaching front staff to use design techniques transforming them into a new cohort change importantly service designers positioned within a public organisation can help shape associations and understanding design championing design as a process rather than exercise in making things look nice they can bridge the gap the design industry and health provision for that designers need more training in translating their skills appropriately feeling comfortable with a certain ambiguity dropping terminology and accepting to work within the more political context the health sector is whilst the scope of change might be limited by political and realities as well as slow progress at times it important to remember that working within a health organisation the designer at the pulse of making change happen it allows one experience the impact service design approaches can have people ways of working and their the ebd approach the ebd approach has been developed based on the work that the institute has done with service designers to focus on patient carer and staff experience of health services the provides a framework to capture and understand health experiences then work together with staff and patients to design better services critical aspect is to really understand the challenges from perspective of those who use the service in order to gather and themes from which we can gain ideas as to how you might the appropriate solutions for the challenges is helping transform services at all levels from management to line staff the methodology is transferable to diverse areas example commissioners who might want to understand a whole pathway to gp observation the tool is an exercise designed to be used by nhs front line staff show the value of observation from a more anthropological than their predominant skill set of clinical observation which symptoms behaviour and diagnosis it has helped teams understand value of observation in understanding the challenge or issue principles are encouraging nhs teams to consider more than benchmarking or measurement of how their service is doing another observing of what is actually happening from a variety perspectives it helps teams think outside of their usual for innovation practitioner we soon realised that to build innovation capability in nhs staff had to cast these tools and individual products in a broader although many of the programmes and have been widely absorbed nhs staff often requested support in these tools and delivering their goals so we started to think how we could best build capability within the nhs and individuals to become themselves knowing that would be the best vehicles to spread and scale new ways of working developed the innovation practitioner programme a programme supports individuals build the skills knowledge and understanding what it means to be an innovation practitioner in a practical the programme enables nhs staff to work in innovative ways and to employ tools and techniques as part of a chosen live within their own work context over a period of several months support an innovation practitioner cohort through a

engaged at work are not engaged and are disengaged disengagement affects performance and leads to losses gallup estimates of billion in the us billion in germany and billion in the five years after the recession companies and countries are struggling and employee engagement is an area that can contribute growth indeed a survey by the economist intelligence unit stepstone found that talent is perceived as the overall third driver growth cited by of senior managers second only to the recovery and the availability of most companies already have programs to engage employees which have been in place for many years and have worked the past so what happened why they as effective for starters people are changing they have different different values and behaviours and new communication preferences make matters more complex the work environment is changing too companies are battling a trust deficit growing larger and more and competing for talent with start ups social organizations and new asian as a result companies are finding crucial now again their employees their workforce their employer brand and communicate their story in relevant in this essay take a look at catalysts that are driving need for drivers companies are leveraging to with employees today and trends to watch out for in the near employee in this essay employee engagement refers to the ongoing with employees throughout the entire employee lifecycle recruitment and onboarding to change development and exit is like a dialogue that allows employees to contribute to participate in the objectives as part of this they more likely to fulfill their own in this way engagement is seen as part of the deal where employer and employee make commitments and derive catalysts for catalysts broadly speaking five major trends are catalysing the for more relevant employee engagement strategies the economy new generations in the workforce new values changing environments and the global information people share experiences and seek information in new employee reviews of google on for years employees have been sharing their opinions and on their personal social networks and blogs now increasingly are sharing on anonymous like glassdoor kununu germany rate my employer canada job australia and the job crowd potential recruits seek out these social conversations and reviews which they trust than the message and which influence their for companies the line between private and public between happens inside and seen on the outside is growing everyday by choice or not employees have become ambassadors for employers and their social voice has the potential to carry across web a recent example is maria i quit video received million views in less than two months and taiwanese animation company next media animation to the people have new sources of information and a message is longer consumed in isolation but as a part of a larger content mix where employee reviews social conversations and external rankings a significant weight now more than ever important that message is aligned internally and externally and that crisis strategy is in new generations in the the workforce has seen a steady influx of gen y and gen c workers bring with them new skills expectations and gen y workers were born between the s and s and grew up mobile and digital technologies beyond expecting their employers to tech and social savvy they expect the opportunity to do work and grow fast they appreciate a flexible work environment supports independence and creativity gen y is not afraid to their opinion and expects two way communication and gen c workers are not defined by age but rather their affinity content creation and curation members of gen c are bloggers photographers podcasters videographers and artists like gen y gen expects the opportunity to collaborate and with peers with the universum global student survey perhaps the most important difference between these generations and x is how they see the role of the job for gen y and gen c the job no longer the first step to buying a house getting married and kids indeed many members of gen y in the us are no longer even instead the job has simply become a means to fund passions increasingly gen y and gen c are seeking alternative of income like crowdfunding or collaborative consumption that they can forgo the job altogether and spend more time doing they when do choose to have a job gen y prefers jobs that offer opportunity to make a difference in their field in their community to the new people feel a strong need to give back to society to minimize environmental footprint and to contribute to social good sustainable development both in their personal lives and also in environment this sentiment is powerful among gen y especially those emerging markets like central and south america and india and among older employees who wish to leave behind a positive people want to work for ethical companies companies that walk talk contribute to social solutions not problems and pave the for employees to play a role as changing work the competitive landscape is changing with new demographics in the place and new competition for aging workforce in the uk workplaces are experiencing a drastic in demographics as more women enter the workplace more people their retirement and more people enter the workforce in countries these shifts will pressure companies to design new and policies that keep in mind new priorities needs and values with the east and the south making up more of the workforce western values will no longer be the in terms of recruitment companies are now competing with tech companies and asian giants like the inverse is true as multinationals and companies recruit the talents needed to thrive in the digital and global era these will push all companies to their internal work and to strengthen their employer brands and differentiate companies and countries have not fully recovered from the effects the recession productivity and profitably are still key areas study finds that employee engagement impacts key indicators absenteeism turnover shrinkage safety quality customer rating productivity and profitability the below demonstrates how companies with the highest engagement outperform those with the engagement and state of the global workplace companies are beginning to acknowledge the relationship employee engagement and low growth rates and are slowly beginning take action governments are beginning to notice too in the government launched the engage

brands communicate with all stakeholders including consumers employees only natural that some of the drivers that engagement with consumers would also apply to engagement employees in addition to the common drivers of social collaboration and sustainability we have also observed a fifth applies strongly to employees these drivers relate both to needs and expectations as as business needs and objectives adoption thus leads to a people are familiar with social media and actively participate creation and sharing of knowledge and ideas for companies there value in capturing this energy and creativity bringing it channelling it towards business many companies today are present and actively share news and photos on popular social networks like linkedin twitter and pinterest some create

consumers employees too like to experience and contribute engaging stories for companies communicating effectively is to inspiring participation and explaining brand values and communications simply put if you want employees to adopt new or change behaviour you need to ensure your message is companies often highlight stories of employees to demonstrate values in action for instance when chemistry

execution business coaching development innovation and business process improvement with than visitors monthly this blog has received prestigious for leadership and management and has been syndicated by several media the best differ from the rest part by nate on in trying to better quantify factors that contribute to excellence surveyed more than small businesses each with to that included a range of service product and companies the participants who were all owners or senior leaders their organizations rated their businesses on many different areas for this analysis we evaluated organizations based on a factor of growth and profitability we thoroughly analyzed the and looked for areas where the lowest and organizations were the most different we found several areas where contrasts were strength of the leadership in our research the leadership teams of rated higher than the lower performers there were two factors evaluated in this rating the first was the ability leadership to define a clear vision for the company for effectiveness the vision needs to be and explained in way so people connect with it and are motivated by the second major factor was appropriate involvement of leadership leading and supporting projects that are strategic to the people in organizations and everywhere for that matter read actions of leadership to determine important and strategy statements and posters by themselves are one client expressed it this way people go in the leadership is walking not pointing the research suggests that leadership of organizations know where they want organization to go make sure everyone else understands the and are visibly engaged in helping the organization move in attract and retain quality organizations are rated stronger at attracting retaining people than the lowest performers people motivating them compensating them keeping them focused keeping them satisfied are always hot topics in focus group and in conversations we have with business owners this is one of most dynamic challenges for all businesses the best small have figured out that success in this area starts with very hard to overcome a hiring mistake and excellent leave nothing to chance in making their hires in addition the small businesses use the strength of their leadership teams stability their sense of purpose and the quality of people them to retain people once on gary six disciplines for next week we will discuss the next areas where the contrasts leading and lasting part by nate on a big difference between an excellent book and an author the evaluation of a single book is it on its own we would normally think however of an excellent author one who wrote over a long period of time and demonstrated the to produce excellent books on a repeatable basis all or participated in moments of excellence a great round of golf superb musical performance or a terrific sales quarter however great round of golf the same as a great season of golf nor is the same as a great career in if the ultimate measure of business excellence is learning and for a long time then how long is enough is success for ten enough twenty years fifty years in their book built last authors jim collins and jerry porras studied businesses survived at least years in order to learn more about companies in the end this question of how long is one only you when it comes to improvement methodologies whether for businesses individuals experience teaches us to be skeptical during the last years that i was leading the solomon organization i stephen the habits of highly effective people for the company in about this training got rave reviews from our team members i notes from wives thanking us for helping their husbands we requests from spouses to attend the book by the same has been on the list for almost years the bottom is that seven habits is filled with good principles and practices help make individuals more effective both personally however made it a practice to ask people who were in one of sessions if still following the prescribed approach lasted a year some two but no one spoken to lasted three remember what eric said at the business improvement conference whitefish montana this material is i probably be doing anything about it two years from this fellow alone all undertaken programs we a quality program at work or a fitness regimen at he was simply expressing the largely unspoken and is it seeing such a pervasive pattern begs the question why as you on begin to answer this question and show you what to do gary six disciplines for leading and lasting part by nate on during a recent meeting of the school board of which i am a we were interviewing candidates for an open position susan not real name was one of the most energetic and passionate ever come across in an interview anywhere she referred to excellence in her answers to our questions a desire be excellent a desire to encourage teachers to be excellent desire to encourage students to be excellent at one point someone in the meeting finally asked susan definition of excellence there was silence and then a answer about attitude and effort and enthusiasm although believe susan clearly has a passion for excellence she determined what it is as stated earlier achieving excellence with deciding what excellence means to you or to your i remember as ceo of solomon year after year write statements like to be the leader in the accounting market over the years we learned we needed to be more specific terms of defining our leadership what types of leadership did we full services price convenience in what markets type of geography etc did we want to one of the most difficult parts of being a leading organization making choices between one path of leadership and another most of are reluctant to make such choices because it eliminates options it holds us responsible to succeed in that one chosen in his book the call os guinness describes a similar challenge graduate students making career choices he says graduate confront it the challenge of choosing a path when the excitement world is my is chilled by the thought that opening up choice means closing down the reality of life is that we have it all and if we try get it all we end up getting very little oh how hard it is to yes to the areas we want to lead in and to say no to the the courage and wisdom to do so is one of the major factors separate leading organizations from the rest of the we as business leaders do great damage when we stir up the people have for pursuing excellence if we yet figured out our business strategy dimensions of leadership organization is going to pursue general conversation about without focused directions for action just gives people a spark of quickly dashed because passion not applied to a lead to in summary committing to excellence means committing the to being a leader in some area important to customers and pursuing that leadership relentlessly the six disciplines is designed to help organizations choose the areas in which they to lead and more importantly to help people align their talents and their energy toward that purpose with the proper focus clarity the potential of the organization will be unleashed expanded for the benefit and reward of both the customers and in the gary six disciplines for leading and by nate on excellent small businesses should have three primary attributes they should be learning organizations individuals in the should be like members of an olympic team where the best keep how to get second excellent organizations should have clearly defined areas which they have chosen to be leaders and they should be relentless their pursuit of those third the ultimate mark of business excellence is the ability sustain handle the difficult times well and to continue grow stronger and better as you read on learn a approach that helps your organization learn lead and over the next three weeks i will be going more with three click here to check out the six disciplines by nate on excellence like beauty is in the eye of the beholder people have different standards of excellence if serious pursuing excellence you must decide what excellence means for organization you also need to be prepared to have your change because as you learn and grow your expectations will change well for businesses useful to think of excellence in terms two broad categories the first is customer excellence and the is business customer excellence has to do with those attributes that are of interest to customers such as quality price reliability speed etc this is the type of excellence that wins product and is featured in advertisements and promotional material one of primary functions of business strategy is choosing the dimensions excellence in which the company will pursue leadership for some businesses may focus their efforts on price leadership some full service or some on in contrast to customer excellence business excellence is transcendent and includes characteristics which are valued and desirable regardless of business type growth predictability longevity etc business excellence and excellence are mutually dependent because neither can be without the other in other words satisfied customers drive success and business success enables investment to satisfy we can learn much about achieving only for customers but for taking a lesson from franchises franchising concept has been wildly successful over the past the appeal of a franchise is rooted in two promises first very clear promise to the customer reflected in the brand comes to mind when you think of second a promise to the business owner franchisee of and proven business model that delivers on the promise the result is it delievers something of to the steaming hot cup of coffee it delivers something of excellence to the business return on investment established business procedures training staffing plans marketing strategies and the point that all businesses should be franchised the point that all businesses would benefit from taking the same approach to excellence that franchises take franchised recognize that there really are two product or which the customer buys and the business which the investor buys goal of six disciplines for excellence is to help business leaders on their businesses so they can be as satisfied with their as their customers are with their harpst in six disciplines for repeatable by nate on a methodology or method is another name for any to getting something done we have methodologies all around us at and at home even though we may call them by different names a for baking a cake is really a methodology the design and processes for building a house constitute a methodology professions have a variety of standard practices to follow to arrive success software developers architects engineers physicians all have standard repeatable practices they follow complete their work successfully these methods emerge as a result of best practices standards rules and developed over a number of just as the purpose of a methodology is to excellent homes the purpose of a methodology is build excellent businesses in chapter we pointed out that excellence caters to the or the customer in example an excellent home caters to preferences including style comfort energy efficiency and similarly a business building methodology caters to the goals business owners profitable and predictable growth engaged strong reputation and a large and loyal customer the initial success of a business depends primarily on the ability build top quality products or services an success depends on building the business itself in addition to products and services understanding this distinction is critical must use a methodology designed for whatever it is building if you expect to achieve consistent six disciplines execution revolution by gary click here to learn more about the six disciplines complete strategy execution by nate on the critical question for every business leader is how do i build organization that consistently executes its strategy or to the question using the business excellence model how can we spend maximum amount of time in quadrant ii balancing the right choices with the ability to get the answer it takes a complete program the reasons other do not last is that they are missing key elements technology alone not enough training by itself is not adequate simply books do it new leadership by itself is not answer retaining better people make the critical hiring an executive coach by itself will not overcome this no the answer lies in taking a more profoundly holistic approach field research has shown us that singular approaches last sustainability the capacity of an organization to the necessary balance between strategy and execution and doing while overcoming the expertise hurdle economics hurdle and the nature hurdles requires a complete program consisting of a repeatable methodology to drive organizational learning accountability coaching to nurture and nudge to stay an execution system to engage everyone every day community learning to share and reinforce best practices accelerate different experts may use alternate terms for these concepts rather than fixating on terminology for now better to focus understanding the underlying six disciplines has been able to create a program that contains four of these elements click here to learn human nature by nate on in the pursuit of excellence figuring

participants from private government institutions to the individual healthcare professionals patients who use the markle foundation linking health care information methods for methods for improving care and protecting however with heightened nationwide emphasis on electronic record ehr adoption and meaningful use of it gone are the days merely overseeing it tactics organizational clinical transformation a stepping stone of massive proportions toward broader solutions for health information exchange as such are tasked with strategically reaching out beyond the four walls their own enterprises to influence hie within the larger simply defined hie is the mobilization of healthcare electronically across organizations within a region or more specifically hospitals and health systems are seeking ways electronically move information between disparate it systems maintaining the meaning of the data being exchanged this requires the communicating parties to agree on a common communications channel and a set of rules or standards for the flow data in most cases this will require tremendous rework on investment in it infrastructure cios will need to lead organizations through this significant investment in upgrades and network infrastructure to achieve interoperable and secure himss analytics reported march survey results indicating more percent of cio respondents currently participate in an hie the it leaders of the percent of organizations which indicated have not yet begun to participate in a connected community the scope of work required should not be underestimated moreover pivotal role of the cio as a business strategist should not be too this paper outlines a number of considerations the cio must when setting a course toward a connected community a primary is to create a positive experience for clinical users to adoption with this in mind this paper explores the potential interoperability platforms to create a unified record from disconnected data no matter what format they are stored in or they are located to provide caregivers with the right information and where it is impetus for connected the importance of physician over the past two decades managed care economics have shifted delivery of healthcare services from acute care to ambulatory community physicians remain the key initiators of medical care therefore represent the greatest opportunity for market share gain health systems in a market that is inundated with providers like philadelphia we are looking at pushing the electronic medical record into the community as a defensive if we do it our competitors will said jim hauck jefferson university in philadelphia pa in fact merritt physician revenue survey quantifies financial impact physicians have on hospitals at an average of million in revenue per physician generated aligning physicians with hospitals through direct employment and means served to increase overall revenue generated by physicians their affiliated hospitals in despite the recession and flat reimbursements for services the creation of an network facilitates physician alignment making it easier physicians to request consultation from a specialist or surgeon in network and to track the care of their patients throughout connected community ron sandifer cio of community memorial system in ventura ca recognized the import of this strategy motivation for hie was based on the fact that ours is a small in which physicians practice across all three hospitals so we something to build our relationships with them and improve care for transparency and patient improved interoperability will enable healthcare organizations operate more effectively as consumerism hastens a transition healthcare quality transparency while payer organizations efforts to inform consumers with quality rankings the claims informing these scores are known to often be incorrect or resulting in misleading scorecards providers are in need comprehensive clinical data that can more accurately compliance with quality additionally as the steady growth of care patients bearing greater financial responsibility for their expenses and overall health management individuals are convenience when managing their healthcare expense experience patients are inconvenienced by conventional processes over the phone waiting to receive lab results repetitively filling out paperwork at the increasingly patients are looking to conduct with their healthcare provider according to consumer research than half percent of us respondents would like to manage healthcare account by managing payments via online and clinical care also stands to benefit from increased involvement through the development of personal health record technology phrs promise to enable patients to become more involved engaged in their care and allow other authorized stakeholders such family and caregivers to access information about patients that previously not available costly to obtain or difficult to electronically evidence suggests that increased patient can result in better outcomes and improved quality via communications with his or her provider and participation in decision making as the use of ehrs expands the interest in phrs growing however widespread use of electronic phrs has been by the difficulty in aggregating data from unconnected systems across the healthcare ecosystem moreover the lack of vocabularies in medical documentation presents challenges presenting that information in an understandable and genuinely way to patients and physicians hauck underscored the size of challenge saying a classic example of a vocabulary complicates the documentation of something as ubiquitous as a attack if you come into one of our practices or the hospital and diagnosis you with congestive heart failure i cant put this in health record i have to use a different vocabulary such as infarction for the system to register a heart attack diagnosis so system understands but the patient if given access to information may healthcare the need for interoperability which can ensure that patient data longer sit in silos within individual provider organizations but enables providers to actively and securely exchange information progressed from a discussion point among industry insiders to a priority of national concern federal efforts to advance technology stem back to with the formation of the health information network nhin initiative designed to all patient records within years as plans for the nhin inch to reality political will to control spiraling healthcare costs and improve quality of care is growing it is estimated that hie among healthcare it systems within the us would deliver of billion annually after full implementation and would result significant direct financial benefits for providers and on february when president barack obama signed into law american recovery reinvestment act arra the health it component the law known as the hitech act appropriated nearly dollars to encourage healthcare organizations to adopt ehr and establish hie networks at the regional level in order to for incentive funding physicians and hospitals must demonstrate use of a certified ehr product that meets current standards defined the department of health and human services additionally must establish connectivity to other providers to improve access to health information and create the capacity to monitor report on their efficacy of their technology to hhs a stipulation of hitech act also requires that all systems protect and safeguard patient the design of the incentive program is meant to jumpstart adoption according to the final rule published in july in incentivepayments may be secured for up to six years but largest payments are available early in the program establishing carrot for early adopters then in the program begins to wield hefty stick for those providers who fail to demonstrate meaningful of an ehr in these will see a reduction in fee schedules from medicare an additional decrease will affected in and down to a total of of the regular schedule then in payment can be further reduced to of regular schedule if the secretary determines that total remains below to guarantee top level recognition for care achieve truly meaningful use of a data providers need advanced emr and technologies that support information exchange hit challenge is a tremendous undertaking that requires understanding of true interoperability and the tools necessary achieve george valko md thomas jefferson university philadelphia in order to realize standardized hie and meet specific criteria meaningful use outlined in the hitech provisions of arra the scope the healthcare cio will swell quickly to encompass the drive organizational compliance as well as community collaboration technology selection decisions made by it leaders today will influence their ability to adopt rapidly and earn maximum incentives while disparate information systems link within an enterprise it infrastructure cios are tasked with challenges of establishing broader interoperability additionally degree to which the selected technology is embraced by clinical especially physicians will largely determine ability to demonstrate meaningful use if physicians not use the systems or are forced to rip and replace their electronic records the more likely the organization is to fall to back of the payment in addition organizations are challenged to comply with proliferating quality mandates and although initiatives depend on comprehensive practice and measures individual components of this data picture may reside databases managed by multiple providers to successfully participate provider must be able to integrate information from disparate while hospitals are currently motivated to earn payments as bonuses the pressure to report will intensify as centers medicare and medicaid service cms and other payers begin to providers who cannot share key clinical information cms expanded quality measures mandated for reporting in fy by measures for fy reporting on each of these measures hospitals to receive a full update to their fy payment rate failure to report docks the rate update by two percentage points most organizations manual data extraction and reporting for measures is not feasible emrs partially facilitate process but lack the reporting capabilities required to integrate across care settings and episodes of accountable while it is easy to fixate on the gross inefficiencies of healthcare system it is relevant to note the high degree of posed by the obese and inactive american patient according to dr bruce metz cio at thomas jefferson university philadelphia pa we have a healthcare system we have a management system given the prevalence of chronic disease the just that our systems are fractured and dealing with a very unhealthy population at large in million americansalmost one out of every two at least chronic illness as a result us health expenditures will almost percent of the gross domestic product within the next creating an utterly unsustainable yet as george md vice chair for clinical programs at thomas jefferson department of family and community medicine commented somewhere the line the primary care physician was squeezed out as the figure in the continuum of care referrals became as multiple physicians in different locations and even different systems treated a various conditions a unified record with someone to own that record and that patient generally experts have proposed using financial incentives to create new types healthcare entities such as the accountable care organization aco the medical home acos drive quality efficiency by exercising the authority to impose practice and compensation devices including penalties and rewards across group of physicians on behalf of the patient population recognition of these returns the patient protection and care act passed by congress and signed into law by president obama march provides funding for aco demonstration projects to implement and test new in addition to acos the pcmh care model is attempting to primary care to encompass partnerships between individual their providers and when appropriate their case studies showcase how health it is being leveraged to realize pcmh in particular a study conducted by the department of affairs va found that a pcmh model providing complex chronically elderly veterans with comprehensive coordinated care reduced the number and length of hospital stays and both medicare and va costs significantly dr metz added care the future is not going to be delivered by an individual physician by healthcare teams we deal with this at the education level as as the practice level our curriculum is geared around people different healthcare professions learning how to work together this at the heart of how we envision future clinical the industry realizes that in order to offer truly effective and disease management programs which forge the foundation of both and pcmh efforts it needs to establish a hub which will house comprehensive health records and clinical data for each patient can then be made available along the continuum of care whatever these hubs take ehrs phrs and other foundational to their disconnected patient whether between shift changes or across transitions of care must share information to effectively treat patients knowledge existing medical conditions drug lists allergies and other information can mean the difference between a positive clinical and an adverse medical event currently the locus of information is generally the patient who is asked to recall communicate their medical histories current problems and allergies although studies routinely demonstrate that patients unable to provide accurate information the unreliability information and the inconvenience of obtaining records from outside providers impel physicians to repeat tests than chase down past results in massachusetts alone percent medical expenditures have been attributed to redundant testing billion per year likewise dr valko said it is critical the point of care to have as much information as possible on a and since patients move around so much it is very difficult to together where to look for this information and so we spend as much an hour per patient trying to call other institutions and get a copy of test results or written report to see what is going paper records remain the norm in many sites of care because they easily archived within a single institution but in a paper world only patient files that can be searched or shared are those locally as a result healthcare workers are accustomed to dealing fragments of available information despite clinical risk waste and additional expense of redundant care a recent study center for the evaluative clinical sciences at dartmouth estimates close to a third of the trillion the us now spends on is duplicative fails to improve patient health or may even to negative clinical to guarantee top level recognition for care achieve truly meaningful use of a patients data providers need advanced emr and technologies that support information exchange hit challenge is a tremendous undertaking that requires understanding of true interoperability and the tools necessary achieve it observed dr building a connected while the benefits of hie are commonly agreed upon early adopters testify to the challenges that have stymied efforts easy to but difficult to surmount there are several persistent surmountable obstacles to creating a connected patient a foundational challenge of hie is one of identity accurately patients with their personal medical information is a problem today for hospitals healthcare providers and organizations including the government unfortunately the problem a difficult one to unravel because the contributing factors are pervasive and varied failure to collect accurate and complete information at registration redundant information entry barriers common names and misspellings can wreak havoc successfully linking electronic records across clinical administrative systems additionally the willful act of individuals fraudulently receive care under another insurance complicates the issue various agencies estimate three to ten of annual healthcare more than billion is lost due to outright fraud however hhs reported january that little has been done to authenticate the identity individuals throughout healthcare and concluded that consumers are significant risk for medical identity yet the financial damages incurred through identity theft overshadowed by the costs to human life and well being failures correctly identify patients can compromise the continuity of care negatively impact patient outcomes although most provider settings a medical record number as a unique identifier to connect across and within their electronic systems many of the across these multiple systems use some patient demographic data validate the interfaced transaction organizations that wish exchange health information with outside entities which do not share common unique identifier are completely dependent upon the accuracy completeness of the key demographic for successful electronic consequently there is an immediate need to uniquely and authenticate a person across the healthcare system including over internet in a secure and way however to stakeholders have developed and implemented only a few solutions aimed at addressing this for hie efforts to survive and thrive economic models must sustainable hie deployment and upkeep of technologies a few maine well established however hies have largely survived to this point funding makes available hundreds of millions of dollars hie support but the awards require organizations to document of one thing is certain connected care presents new and challenges to all entities involved by definition a community an individual healthcare organization is not able to deploy a vendor approach to solve the gaps in transitions of care in new technologies which enable system interoperability are evolving business relationships are forming in unprecedented ways one paradigm depends on hospitals and health systems to shoulder majority of the financial burden to win the allegiance of physicians from to the number of operational hies hospitals provided upfront funding for of them and financial support for the ability of vendors to act as true partners is important need to feel confident that the vendor is open to interoperability they need to demonstrate a commitment to work toward the adoption bruce metz phd thomas jefferson philadelphia by contracting in mass and providing implementation services systems can serve as advocates for physicians and thereby competitive advantage in securing physician referrals as effects kick in more adoption increases the economy of scale support and overall benefits of the connected community health systems face a tight window of opportunity as safe exemptions expire in december at which time they will no longer able to distribute ambulatory ehr licenses although driven by confluence of incentives including competitive and federal funding a approach is not sustainable richard cramer associate cio of operations and information exchange at umass memorial healthcare said the are very enthusiastic right now but they expect us to pay everything eventually they will have to put some skin in the game they start to realize their own practice management benefits bruce metz from thomas jefferson university pointed out the remains to be seen if we can really affect some sort of cost by using the emr in small practices this will determine if can pay for electronic health records going however sandifer held a more optimistic view made the of which we may get back through arra even offering connectivity to physicians and hospitals in the community are not part of our network the commitment for them is an monthly fee for an appliance i think our sunk costs will be over in couple years surely as more and more data is amassed there will need for more hardware but that will be a good problem to have by way of thinking the more data that is brought in the better it is our organization and our the path toward more connected communities will bring cios with federal and state governments as well as consumers as partner to share access to applications data and networks needs and technical conflicts inevitably breed disagreement of these issues requires the stewardship through the waters of hie governance to help stakeholders agree on standards develop common processes for change control governance issues become serious political issues and are difficult to solve hauck we have decided not to wait for the government to sort out we are in the process of going to sister organizations and through these issues among ourselves in the long run we believe is going to be the better model for the in fact the nature and ease of governance is greatly influenced by data model selected by the organization a hybrid model which both central and federated data capture supports a master management strategy in which a centralized repository contains single version of the truth with respect to medical records data then shared according to detailed specifications that comply with regulatory requirements and hospital policy software products multiple records from disparate systems and enable applications create composite views of patient data that can then be delivered to ehr using web services or through a clinical portal solution approach eliminates problems that stem from providing direct access one healthcare provider to data maintained by another it also for a consistent set of business rules that control access to the managed in multiple provider beyond matters of data ownership and control effective information governance requires diligent monitoring and management the way in which patient information is secured in order to with the health insurance portability and accountability act and hospital policies organizations must monitor and track all to patient data traditionally cios were required to review application separately to check for infractions by employees which a time consuming exercise within a system designed around a data management strategy a single software application can view activity across all the stewardship of information is yet another very important of governance the quality of information presented to patients caregivers is only as good as the data that enters the system the objective is to craft a data management model that can inconsistent data ensure that it is accurate and meaningful and then share it with downstream business processes for example and logic can be established for correcting information and suspect data for manual review likewise vocabularies can normalized for consistent communications among providers and additionally as technologists cios contribute a critical service translating the needs of community providers into hie requirements while weighing the benefits and tradeoffs of technological approaches to hie cramer recommended a governance which evolves through incremental steps working from the base of original governance policies toward improvements enabled by the use new technology in many cases our methods for sharing mirror what we had already established for governance of paper for example where the hospital once faxed test results to a the same authority allows the hospital new latitude to transmit electronically and where a doctor who previously had permissions view records within the hospital he or she can now access those records via a portal with no change in policy furthermore warned against a governance model i have seen data sharing efforts fail because they were too ambitious and tried do everything at once instead a prudent approach would be to provide enabling technologies for pertinent processes and that were most essential to patient care with cio solutions can be implemented which serve the immediate and goals of the standards are the building blocks of hie as published that establish a common language and technical criteria ensure that data and processes match at both the source destination computer systems the adoption of standards developers of new technologies a consistent data framework that reduce development time and costs and further speed it is the purview to educate organizational leadership on and federal hit activities and their influence on and hie technology acquisitions should focus on vendors who investing in conformance to interoperability standards using specifying interoperability standards like those harmonized by healthcare information technology standards panel hitsp organizations to simultaneously solve challenges such as linking to outpatient facilities planning to connect to the broader community while the specifications are evolving for certified ehrs other initiatives emerged to accelerate interoperability integrating the enterprise ihe is one such initiative lead by professionals and industry ihe provides a detailed implementation testing process to promote the adoption of interoperability by vendors and users of healthcare at events known as connectathons ihe provides validation of interoperability and compliance with profiles which leverage communication standards such as dicom and security standards through testing developers gain a clear implementation path for documented reviewed and tested communication standards while purchasers benefit from interoperability assurances that reduce complexity cost and anxiety of implementing it systems dr suggested that the alignment of vendor and user goals around is essential the ability of vendors to act as true partners important providers need to feel confident that the vendor is open interoperability and they need to demonstrate a commitment to toward the adoption of another set of obstacles has to do with hie policy as it relates privacy concerns a survey by the california healthcare showed that even when people understood the health advantages by linking their health records a majority believed that the risks lost privacy and discrimination outweighed the benefits six later a subsequent study found that two in three americans concerned about the confidentiality of their personal information consumer distrust poses a problem in those states have individual standards for electronic patient data cios may need to educate their local communities on the benefits security of ehr systems in order to maximize the rates ensure that the organization achieves the electronic data necessary for meaningful use to truly share information in a way that is trusted and policies must be established regarding the parameters of access acceptable uses of information the specificity with which patients give or withhold access to their information and the design of and security safeguards ideally these policies should be created parallel with the design and deployment of technology so that architecture and applications support these principles hauck when it comes to privacy we have no idea how hie and new privacy are going to be security reasonable security safeguards should be built and implemented loss unauthorized access destruction use modification disclosure of personal information no information system of the safeguards built in can be secure but appropriate of protection coupled with tough remedies and enforcement measures breaches can strike a fair balance controls should include a updated authentication and authorization regimen auditable records access and transmittal and mechanisms for enforcement sanctions for violation as a matter of policy anyone who accesses or transmits data should be obligated to immediately any security breach through direct communication to those cramer recommends that cios assume a staged approach to issues start with your staff providers first allow them to log in look at the ambulatory and inpatient data you will learn a lot hie while avoiding the brunt of the security issues in the plan your community security strategy there are issues that have not yet been security is an ongoing effort as there is no way to fully secure system in advance nor can it be secured once and for all hauck that security is a big deterrent for hie between entities because your information is in the hands of a partner and is breached you liable this is a can of worms that has to be resolved at the same that we are all implementing and deploying all security involves constant balancing of threat and the cost of avoidance the of implementation and changes in the security landscape as new and defenses develop the hiring of a security team to provide testing of the ability to ward off attack will confidence in the resilience once it is technology the solution market for technology is marked by a flow new companies entering the market and continual market experts expect dramatic changes in the next to months as technologies become more widely adopted and dominant players their way into a crowded market currently made up of many vendors while the marketplace is morphing mergers and acquisitions of players staying power within marketplace will rest on the innovation and customer success of smaller group of system developers the direction of this has been suggested by dr david blumenthal national coordinator health information technology among them blumenthal attests to importance of both discrete data exchange with emrs and interoperability as critical innovations required for truly as cios begin vetting solutions they are soon inundated by a flood options that pledge optimal connectivity from portals to strategies cios must be prepared to assess strengths and limitations of solution as each relate to the needs resources of their organization and community we have a opportunity and the potential is there but how this really plays remains to be seen there needs to be a vendor shakeout having emr vendors is not going to work how will physicians chose it an exciting time but in the market there is a fair amount uncertainty said dr a solution is a misnomer because once your move out of single organization you have to have interoperability to data all solutions premised on a monolithic database are jim hauck thomas jefferson philadelphia portals provide caregivers with access and views into select information although easy to use and offering convenient portals fall short of being able to integrate data and offer utility for hie for example a physician portal can provide a with a view to recent laboratory test results but it cannot analysis of lab values across the enterprise so while it may meet immediate wish list of community physicians it will not meet broader reporting public health research and quality objectives of the community furthermore portal solutions rely on data repositories to normalize data formats so information can be made available and presented in a meaningful integrated enterprise one common approach to hie requires an organization to rely upon single vendor for its it infrastructure organization a nineclinic health system aspired to monolithic vendor approach for its interoperability desire from day one was to try to have a single vendor but while solution offers the promise synchronicity a missing or immature application in the product and in many cases an aging technology platform can challenge approach since the emr was not going to meet our quickly we started looking for another ambulatory emr option this the first time made a conscious decision to deviate from our hit environment shortly thereafter we further allowed our hospitals to keep their ed system which they superior to the core system offering and now we are looking at cpoe system as well so while we had hoped for a vendor solution it ends up that we will have a number of wrapped around a number of provider organizations have gone to great lengths achieve the vision of interoperability but at significant expense of wholesale replacement of existing logistically this replacement is a difficult proposition long implementation timeframes since the cio cannot take down the system for the weekend to retool and while a solution may be the right choice for the needs of a single facility integrated health system the strategy is not for the community at large it is impractical to assume participants will agree to swap their existing systems disrupting the workflows tied to these systems for a new software standard requiring complete of staff solution is a misnomer because once your move out of single organization you have to have interoperability to data all solutions premised on a monolithic database are explained hauck cramer echoed this point saying everyone seamless integration but few of us can afford the million tag for what is essentially a red herring with of our coming from private physicians no single vendor solution suffice insisting on a community in which physicians conform to use of one single ehr is interoperability more and more provider organizations are exploring the potential interoperability platforms which create a unified record from various sources generating patient data no matter what format they stored in or where they are located in short platforms represent a strategy that allows information systems to access the patient data needed and to them to caregivers in the format they prefer the exchange may within an integrated system or across solutions there is no need for a community to enforce a uniform for patient medical records this approach to hie holds distinct for us semantics is the key you have the worked out bother trying to exchange jim hauck thomas jefferson philadelphia system agnostic using an interoperability platform means providers across the are able to use their preferred it systems within their own hauck recalled we believe we had to go with an solution it is an investment into future requirements we are locked into a silo with one vendor that do everything we needed to create an elegant interoperability solution because know that at some point we are going to have to exchange with epic cerner siemens and others a local urologist may one emr for instance while the multispecialty practice the road is committed to another there is no need for providers agree to reinvest common brand of technology they use systems that meet their individual clinical needs workflow semantic in practice electronic health information sharing is complicated volumes of unstructured medical data such as scans of written the range of information from structured to unstructured data multiple types of support in interpreting or handling the records ranging from no formal support to full support as in the case of laboratory systems the challenge is create an environment that is flexible enough to facilitate among systems of varying sophistication and to support the of data to more structured still connectivity at any level is useless without an means of communicating the true meaning of patient information in clinical systems to facilitate understanding interoperability platform can enable a healthcare organization to and make sense of data being exchanged semantic preserves the original meaning of the of its ensure its integrity in the host system so that the receiving can understand and make appropriate use of the incoming data from thomas jefferson university underscored the criticality preserving meaning for us semantics is the key you have the semantics worked out bother trying to exchange dr valko provided an example a patient may be mandated by insurance to go to various labs for tests each company has a lab system which defines different results ranges for example normal hemoglobin range in our system may be while in system it might be so a cbc or hemoglobin test might have different data elements depending on the lab provider semantic interoperability takes all those data elements shows them to the physician in a way that seamlessly compares apples apples similarly semantic interoperability facilitates medication reconciliation by consolidating long lists of into varying levels of therapeutic categories such as statins and blockers and drugs physicians presented with these categories can drill down categories of interest for greater detail such as dosage history risk of error is reduced because physicians are not forced to through endless formulary items to glean actionable information dr metz pointed out that many providers may not yet be aware of need for semantic interoperability with things so paper based getting the information into an electronic form is a huge gain until you have to combine and coordinate electronic that you realize the need to make sense of collated or exchanged that day is quickly value of soa when beginning to formulate designs for a connected initiative cios would be wise to consider interoperable built within a architecture soa framework uses of soa frameworks include the ability to access a rental car hotel reservation systems from an airlines reservation system or management of inventory data across retail handheld applications and portals unlike the platforms of monolithic enterprise systems interoperability provide a approach which allows providers flexibility to sculpt a system to their needs in healthcare platform facilitates interoperability among existing or administrative systems workflows and processes since have typically deployed a wide range of different vendors and each with its own structure development tools and underlying logic soa platform can smooth out the differences to enable productive sharing when asked which hospital system implementation will have greatest impact on healthcare nearly percent of respondents in healthcare it news survey identified soa ultimately soa platforms promise to elevate healthcare computing the high standards of consumer computing with easy to use and access to a single comprehensive view of meaningfully patient data anywhere and anytime via mobile devices such as iphone blackberry the benefits of operating within an soa framework services written once can be reused by any and applications maintenance items and changes are automatically in all applications using the service ultimately applications can make use of a common set of services for very different resources time and money increasing the speed to value shared promising incremental applications and data electronic

referring physician in a community has the potential generate million in incremental revenue health systems community solutions that leave no doctor behind designing connectivity hub to the level of its least sophisticated spoke hamper the ability to realize returns transitioning from paper digital data cannot be achieved overnight success depends providing a vetted pathway to the hie for physicians estimated to comprise as many as percent of all practices while enhancing the participation value for all we have high expectations for our rollout of an platform for hie the community physicians are feeling pressure to something according to the cio today should be a business strategist and understand what happening in bruce metz phd thomas jefferson philadelphia one approach to dealing with the spectrum of maturity among participants is to implement a system that defines classes participants a user distinction for example could providers who will implement the absolute minimum amount of necessary to get records from the system while a member could be held for those who will implement the full range technological requirements contractual obligations and services can then be tailored to correlate with a classification encouraging movement to the higher level over lagging ehr adoption demonstrates that many physicians are resistant to the practice changes required by electronic keeping for these providers incremental adoption of which require a smaller initial investment or yield a very high beneficial business case present excellent starting points to clinicians to it adoption and information sharing cramer let arrest progress someone will say what my patient is on vacation in los angeles and is seen by an ed about privacy concerns for our hiv get sucked by these extreme cases or they will consume you just focus on immediate and real improvements that can be made like the delivery of documents and online tools for disease management represent prime examples of good applications on which to build toward ehr incremental applications should both support practice workflow provide the it infrastructure improvements necessary to more comprehensive solution integration along the road to evolving with incremental some prefer a focus on incentives for ehr system within provider enterprises trusting that connectivity between will organically emerge at a later date others advocate for construction of hie networks first to spur the adoption of applications focusing solely on ehr adoption perpetuate the number of proprietary programs that cannot linked while an isolated emphasis on could yield a gilded freeway with no cars forcing an incremental on providers ready to adopt a full ehr is as counterproductive expecting too big a leap from their fortunately none of these extremes are with an interoperability platform approach it is possible to simultaneous rollout of applications and infrastructure development incremental steps in this way each advance brings the hie closer the ultimate goal as all with disparate greater speed to value in the near term incremental represent opportunities to change provider behavior and to build the necessary infrastructure dr valko has seen the value incremental deployment physicians who have adopted emrs begin to the benefit and they want more they want to see all test results one place they want to mine the data they want to produce reports real time they want the computer to warn them about needed tests they what to spend time searching for information incremental opportunities can achieve quick return by providing directly to patients and in so doing increase public interest and in health the role of the cio is to ensure that an incremental approach dead ends from isolated steps taken without an integrated the cio today should be a business strategist and understand what happening in healthcare said dr metz furthermore the cio advocate for the continual expansion of ehr functionality so safety and quality improvements through clinical decision materialize i have much more visibility into and contact with physicians than ever before i am out at seminars conference and meetings tagging along with the physicians i am out there working the products vendors physicians and the executive committee to how we will meet and fund our needs for the organization and community reflected regardless of the starting point the investment and resources to the enterprise or within the not mutually exclusive anticipating significant future investments establishing connectivity with the ambulatory services cios should involved now to position their infrastructure and prepare for connectivity cramer encouraged fellow cios dive in it matter where you get started the important thing is that you wait on the sidelines organizations will be well served by initiative that begins within the hospital or health and affiliated practices and clinics then focus on connecting neighboring organizations as a cio i am less involved in the day day operations of my department than ever before as my function more of an oversight role in working with more stakeholders in broader community said sandifer by tackling the issues complicate enterprise data exchange cios will be equipped for the issues that face hies such as patient identifier reconciliation exchanging medical summaries with in order to build connected communities in which participants critical information across various healthcare settings it must be interoperable in the absence of an interoperability clinicians are forced to provide care with incomplete resulting in redundant costly and sometimes dangerous disconnection impedes sustainable effective disease management patients who wish to work in partnership with their likewise advances in public health surveillance medical research the scrutiny of care when providers are afforded connectivity as well as tools to integrate and assimilate patient information in a manner the potential for healthcare quality and clinical improvement is boundless the integration and availability information will reap significant benefits for all participants costs associated with the transfer of information are reduced enhanced care creates demand for services providers will see results in the bottom the time has come for cios to introduce the discussion of hie their organizations it is not a matter of if but when hie become a mandate in each market as in all hit initiatives cios inevitably face this challenge with limited time and fortunately they are not alone nor are they the first to chart waters healthcare organizations across the country have significant advances in connected healthcare their trials tribulations exist to help others achieve similar gains faster and efficiently organizations actively engaged in hie including jefferson university university of pittsburgh medical center umass memorial health care and community memorial health system the following words of advice on implementation success obtain board and executive sponsorship and foster ownership of the project among physician champions and commit dedicated it staff secure strong commitments from partner prepare for challenges with data issues in source ambulatory emr systems for example have wide disparity accommodate the unique needs of physicians each physician want different types of data so you need to be able to tailored requirements eg some physician will want visibility all labs while others only want to see a discharge summary outpatient theres always always more to according to these vanguard organizations in return for the hard and investment cios can expect to realize the following physician cost variability improved information connected healthcare beyond the strong and effective strategic the prudent strategists will prepare now by gathering lessons from their colleagues laying the technology and political within their own organizations and by monitoring it standards practices and the emerging role of state and federal governments hie you have to get out into associations forums and meetings cios and other executives gather and hear what your peers are there is a lot of really good activity going on you cannot succeed you stay behind your desk in your office warned dr metz armed knowledge and a renewed perspective on the critical role they cios can help shape the vision for a connected community and lead way dr metz suggested i think at this point in time we can an

increasingly considered instruments of social and face rising expectations in terms of training qualified insights of direct relevance to society and engaging in commercial the new universities as entrepreneurs and contributors to social and economic has as a third mission this role comes in addition to the functions as institutions of advanced education and both in developed and developing countries have only imperfect knowledge options and research demonstrates that they generally look for their existing competencies fagerberg and godinho in less circle of competencies is likely to be further from the knowledge therefore of considered options may be limited moreover the possibility of new processes depends on research and development capabilities and are there therefore in order to avoid being trapped on an inferior path low countries are in particular need of enhance technologies supply needed skills services and other inputs strengthen networks universities are well positioned to meet this challenge extent they the technology frontier and are responsive to the needs of make up a prominent part of all national innovation systems in america this the case as universities are the primary employers of researchers receive the public subsides for research in countries such as argentina brazil and than percent of all researchers are employed by universities due to of tradition universities in latin america have unrealized potential for to productive use the importance of university education and in industries however due to are becoming increasingly important also to other industries as paper discusses trends and challenges within latin american universities well as available for strengthening their contributions to social and economic it intended to provide an exhaustive analysis but focuses on some of the key in the region the third mission of universities is often equated narrowly defined as licensing and commercialization of research this adopts approach and explores how the new role of universities affects all of in latin america including advanced education and research the with of how universities contribute to national innovation systems overviews of advanced human capital in latin america and its relation to needs and relevance of academic research is the focus of section section for the transfer and diffusion of new knowledge section commercial activity places on university governance structures and and from the to the role of universities in economic development has been on the policy agenda decades war ii united states a seminal report science endless us science policy and had a strong influence around the world the innovation starts with fundamental research which through applied work develops into product design and marketing such model and industry have independent but complementary tasks research and industry uses the results for practical application this model also prescribes appropriate government support due to research is underprovided in the market research results are the number does not increase the price and therefore wide dissemination is socially it be which causes a problem most importantly practical fundamental research is unpredictable and return on investments often has a all this makes basic research an unattractive investment option for linear model from basic research to a new process or marketable product not contemporary innovation processes research is not only a foundation but is informed and inspired by it much scientific advancement been driven by interest in practical solutions new technologies and interaction different fields have also led to the development of entirely new academic such science and biotechnology strong linkages between industry and are both in terms of the relevance of science and technological in rise in applied research in fields such as agricultural research materials and has stimulated interaction between universities and industry in the contribution of universities has developed well beyond applied universities and industry are not only in close interaction but borders roles of tasks have become increasingly blurred universities establish companies in research parks they create technology transfer offices in actively diffusion and business opportunities and they work as equal of new businesses hence the relationship between university industry and government is marked by close overlapping roles as prominently symbolized by the triple helix model universities and natural resource based importance of research and advanced human capital is usually discussed in context innovative sectors and studies often demonstrate that cooperation prominent in industries eg however this should not divert attention from economies heavily the export resources latin america included due to technology increasingly important also for industries that typically are not tunzelmann and acha suggests that science and technology policy can be effectively used value production there may be high returns to upgrading strong value to existing processes and products in latin america perceived compared to natural activities has constrained the full potential of their natural advantages as demonstrated by et natural activities in the region can be converted into and lead growth for long periods of if economies see their challenge not in creating new technology but existing technologies they cannot afford not to develop a domestic capacity is necessary to identify scientific and technological to adapt to local needs and to create technologies that are unique to the verspagen as suppliers of advanced education and dominant players in latin american play a central role in developing such a linkages in latin from recent innovation surveys conducted in argentina chile colombia that considerable benefits can be accrued from increased an analysis of data from chile finds that with the propensity of a private enterprise being involved in patenting percent other explanatory variables in the model constant collaboration also the company involvement in product innovation whereas the analysis finds no process innovation table table marginal effect of company characteristics on patents product process firm export active firm age ln age firm size ln size collaboration universities consultants suppliers other firms absorptive internal department human innovation related training observations note significant at level the three models are based on probit of binary dependent no sample selection bias is found using method the an extraction from the full models explanatory variables including controls for economic source mark et al potentially significant returns from collaboration evidence suggests universities and private companies are quite weak in latin america the low regard among entrepreneurs in the region for the quality of university and lack of capacity among private companies to absorb knowledge surveys conducted by the international institute for show that universities in the region are perceived not to be responsive needs of industry emphasizing academics over commercial applications in imd low level of collaboration is also evident in and public research institutes are among the least employed for when it comes to innovation projects in latin america in mexico percent companies had established cooperation agreements with universities had done so with public research institutes melo similarly an survey from shows that the most important external partners are suppliers clients and consultancies universities and training public laboratories technology transfer offices ttos and government are much less the partner of choice for private innovators secyt addition to real or perceived low relevance of academic research is hampered of incentives for public researchers to address private sector knowledge latin america suggests that the inward orientation of academia is by hiring rules which put extensive stress on academic publications lundvall in the region generally do not recognize the value of who take part in projects risks weakening their moreover bureaucratic rigidities make mobility and cumbersome and from the oecd shows that knowledge and technology transfer is often entrepreneurship and initiative bhef hence strengthening in latin america hinges to a large degree on the ability of policy and to make it more attractive for individual faculty members to engage in partnerships with industry one of the most important challenges in this is to promotion and reward structures to fully recognize factors such as in research projects and effectiveness in attracting external tension in between universities and industry raises the concern to what activities with the public service function of universities universities and different missions values and cultures and face different and in academia open scrutiny of research results techniques and is considered a critical element in upholding high quality standards generally engage in research projects and are expected frontier forward by making results publicly available firms on the hand focus on specific research activities and have an interest in from potential competitors at least until the research is evaluated a has been filed dasgupta and david university leaders in latin america conflicts of interest are a legitimate can obtain external financial support and broaden the experience students by working with the productive sector they must also guard against research organizations indebted to their sponsors nonetheless suggests concern at this point is too little collaboration rather than too much in latin america are still in the early phases of opening up to with as will be discussed in section it is important to develop in this process to protect the ability of universities to produce knowledge public advanced production of highly skilled human capital is undoubtedly the main to national innovation systems efforts to upgrade the technological innovation are unlikely to yield a high return if not complemented a of advanced human capital de ferranti et al therefore systems need of high quality and ensure that graduates have skills relevant to the labor capital formation may be a strategic priority even before a country industry evidence suggests that technologies not only increase demand but are adopted more extensively in organizations with a high share et al large increases in the supply of workers with university in the to the rapid technological change of the time and accelerated the for south korea for example started to expand higher education which not only enabled but also contributed to the rapid progress in years university education in latin suggests that jobs presupposing university education have grown lower skill levels in latin america moreover new technologies have productivity of educated workers in the region as a result the wages of higher education are on the rise everywhere in latin america in for to university education rose percent between and while to secondary education remained largely unchanged patrinos and vegas in latin america have responded to increased demand for advanced and diversifying the supply of university education in of were enrolled in postsecondary institutions this represents in enrollment of more than percent since uruguay argentina and and are among the regional leaders with enrollment rates of more than growth however latin america still lags behind leading economies countries the average higher education enrollment rate is currently figure figure gross higher education enrollment in latin america and the etratnemll roness rog oecd chile uruguay argentina colombia mexico el brazil source world bank and for indec and spu is not only the quantity of skilled labor that is important for a education has to be relevant for industrial needs and provide skills change evidence suggests that employers increasingly value order as finding analyzing and applying knowledge instead of passive subject therefore the development of new pedagogical approaches such as and reflective practice are becoming increasingly expansion and diversification of the higher education sector has caused in the quality of higher education services in the region many struggle teaching materials and lack of laboratory equipment in the hard it is for students to engage in experiments and practice in the universities to supply society with high quality advanced education is also by of university teaching staff in latin america only a small of in the region holds doctoral degrees and is actively involved in for example percent of faculty in mexico and colombia has a phd degree the only to low level in the region is brazil where percent of the staff in universities level qualifications figure figure proportion of professors doctoral degrees ytl cuaf ng eachitfoegat uk brazil chile argentina average venezuela mexico source world coverage has increased in undergraduate university education expansion has been less pronounced in latin america master and doctoral level roughly percent of tertiary enrollment in the region al as the number of completed phd degrees is quite small in latin and is only slowly increasing ricyt this challenge is also relatively of researchers brazil a regional leader in science technology has one researcher per thousand people in the work force which should be to and spain and the republic of korea respectively ricyt the low number negative implications for the ability to build critical mass advanced skills companies and provide training for the next generation of policies promoting educational responding to labor market between the qualifications of tertiary graduates and productive arise in insufficient information about shortages and opportunities in the labor in latin america do not collect data on labor market outcomes on a basis exception is colombia where the ministry of education has labor to monitor and analyze the professional performance of university data about skill shortages and labor market outcomes of university input for the future planning of curricula and course interaction between universities and companies is vital to ensuring a educational output and the need for human resources in the economy particular have begun to collaborate with employers when designing although still on a small scale several countries in latin america curricula in tertiary education with clarity on the skills students to acquire in the tuning latin america project for example the region collaborate in defining competencies for eight fields in interaction between industry and education can also take a more immediate in companies and involvement of practitioners in teaching are relevant tertiary education but can also be used in many professional in addition students to be employees universities may prepare them to generate of universities in latin american have included courses in in for example engineering students at the catholic university of janeiro are required to complete training in entrepreneurship and business al quality high academic quality in advanced education is another challenge countries america quality became a public issue in the region especially in the of of the private higher education sector as a response governments high priority or strengthening accreditation and evaluation procedures in agencies for undergraduate programs have been created in chile colombia costa rica el salvador mexico and nicaragua et methods used for quality evaluation vary among countries but generally of external peer review quantitative performance assessment the first generation of quality assurance was heavily on inputs aspects of education over time quality assurance has evolved to on learning outcomes and acquired latin american countries have started to address deficiencies in teaching with new funding instruments argentina and chile for example funding to encourage quality improvements in higher education projects developed and proposed by universities this approach has when linked to quality assurance program and institutional to identify weaknesses and appropriate remedies funding for improvement provides the means by which corrective action can be taken hence the of instruments ensures that funding targets key weaknesses and that quality meaningful exercise with a direct operational impact quality can also be performance and increasing accountability at the teacher level for have been established in a number of countries aiming to increase of and encourage excellence in teaching regardless of the by students are also becoming a more common strengthening doctoral and professional education remains underdeveloped in latin america most countries do phds to fill the vacancies at tertiary institutions created by retiring let a knowledge base in industry and public research institutions with more graduates per year brazil is the best example of a successful education in the region this achievement rests on the combined and the ministry of education ministry of science and technology and state support from the federal agency capes has allowed graduate programs recruit educated abroad as faculty members schwartzman provides another interesting case of how expansion of graduate education feasible short period of time since chile has made targeted investments in the for existing and new doctoral programs coupled with efforts to by making phd scholarships available to talented students moreover have been supported to mitigate some of the disadvantages of low dispersion although chile still has a low production of the in recent years are impressive between and the number of from to students thorn link between graduate education and industry is at the center of efforts systems in latin america graduate education in the region is often with incentives and tradition for pursuing collaboration with industry and a outside with industry promises to promote industrially relevant research and create relationships that continue after graduation a been taken in the region to bring private companies and phd students one to provide incentives students to undertake their thesis work in with for example is developing a program where a proportion of doctoral are thesis advisor in both academic and a private company the objective is to and encourage mobility of advanced human capital between academic research and excellence is a critical factor for knowledge production linkages low quality research does not serve students companies country at large preliminary data from chile suggest that academic in fact a for the ability of universities to commercialize research with staff and higher publication rates are more likely to produce be involved research partnerships kawax research is expensive and increasingly so even leading research have need to prioritize fields acknowledging that it is not feasible to in all science eg nas such prioritizations generally direct resources to with potential where the necessary research infrastructure and human exist resources there is a need to maintain a balance between fundamental in universities in a way that builds intellectual capability and research projects the comparative advantage of universities industry is solid academic competence hence the importance of high quality not be underestimated even if the link between academic research and is often academic research in latin quality of research in latin american universities is not uniformly good the funds allocated them and agapitova shows scientific publications relative to the level of income for a sample countries trend line reflects the expected log of isi publications per million when a is performed on the log of per capita gdp the data indicate that countries in publish below what is expected based on their level of income in as argentina brazil and mexico produce on average an international every five years moreover the quality of research as indicated by the impact low in the region articles published by researchers in argentina brazil mexico are times which should be compared to and times for articles by in finland and spain respectively thorn figure publications per million people relative to gdp per israel uk russia lithuania chile ukraine turkey ionstacil romania georgia egypt pubics morocco senegal of malawi cote log of per capita gdp note some names have been omitted to make the graph more source thorn production and quality is dependent on various factors as noted the of academic research staff is an issue facing most countries in professors often see their main role in instruction rather than which is from the old university model in latin america where universities institutions a low emphasis on research is particularly evident in generally have a high proportion of staff and tends to be in fields moreover major universities enjoy great of and maintain incentive structures that do not reward excellence there are pockets of quality research in latin america even if level compare well with countries cetto and vessuri for several nobel policies promoting research quality and incentive subsides for university research can be used by governments to provide research and to shape cooperation between researchers and industry of research funding in latin america is in the form of annual on the basis of the previous allocation the problem with twofold first the system is not based on research output and therefore not research and second the system tends to be bureaucratic and research funding is gradually gaining legitimacy and in the to a number of positive effects competing for research grants has proven encourage research and channel funds to the most productive researchers thereby of available talent moreover yearly competitions allow governments to by targeting eligibility and selection criteria hence competitive promises the efficiency of research funding competition based research now by national science and technology commissions in latin america in assign internal research funds based on open competition and peer the university of the republic in uruguay for example has set a allocates about percent of funds for on a competitive basis one priorities fostering linkages to the productive sector et al drawback of the traditional funding system in latin america is its due availability of research grants principal researchers are to draw on of sources to fund different aspects of a project eg participation conference students and purchasing equipment this takes time and effort of away from and makes planning difficult moreover as the funding is not and predictable the system discourages undertaking ambitious such as brazil chile and mexico have begun to introduce larger which not various aspects of a successful research project but the project is given a level of autonomy in allocating project research grants have an additional value they stimulate researchers to and bring together teams for specific projects creating networks institutions and different disciplines can help overcome some of the that a lack of critical networks however do not always emerge at networks may need an external impetus as well as supportive infrastructure several countries in latin america have created centers of and smaller scale science nuclei in order to bring together some of the best evidence suggests that these centers have improved the quality and by concentrating research efforts yammal and thorn and et al retaining talented countries face an additional challenge when attempting to their best talent is often drawn away by more advanced countries obvious from latin america to mainly the united states and europe is wage level however is not the only reason why talented researchers leave oecd countries and especially the us are attractive to scholars from entire two additional reasons because of the research infrastructure technology which gives important professional opportunities and because of career structures which provide professional opportunities and to retain talent countries in latin america have to face both of issues are underway to transform traditional seniority based career latin increasing the visibility of good practices and encouraging excellence in mexico has a program that links salary increases and career progression for to a number of measures for academic performance in addition to the research evidence suggests that the program has been successful in drain opportunities for talented young scholars et al transfer and commercialization of teaching and research universities are increasingly expected to make to economic development and to the wellbeing of society this new not only to produce but also commercialize knowledge ie to use results intellectual property and contribute to new processes and products in the number of universities in latin america have taken up this new challenge by structures engaging in research partnerships and patenting research promoting linkages and majority of universities in latin america have unrealized potential for the of collaboration ranging from informal of new businesses formal relationships eg parks visible and therefore subject to considerable attention in policies in informal contacts and contract research may correspond much better to in the us for example only few universities generate substantial from research and the vast majority including mit for example earn less percent research budgets from licensing intellectual property oecd at least of all licensing income earned by universities is generated by one area the life sciences canton informal contacts and contract suggests that the overwhelming majority of knowledge flows from to informal linkages and collaboration senker faulkner and are several reasons for this first most knowledge requirements are of and arise suddenly in the course of research and development second is tacit and element in the expertise industrial seek and they interact with academia finally mutual respect and understanding for success in formal partnerships and these are most easily up faulkner and velho linkages and university contract research have grown substantially in years america in part this reflects efforts by universities to adjust to per student and meet a rising demand for tertiary education in peru for in public universities rose from to percent of their budget and maintaining a policy of no tuition in undergraduate education a proportion income was generated through contract research and services pattern is found in argentina brazil and research collaboration in latin america is a of building communication and strengthening incentives one of the key obstacles lack sector confidence in the quality and the relevance of academic when funding research and notably changing incentives at the the would go a long way in addressing this challenge with few research agencies in latin america have unrealized potential for changing practices to encourage faculty members to collaborate with external and pursue interests researchers associated with the national council of research conicet in argentina for example are evaluated by on traditional academic criteria such as publications and citations a with industry risks not being formally recognized for this effort mobility of advanced human effective way to boost the transfer of tacit knowledge and build company is mobility and the exchange of researchers and company staff data the innovation survey for example suggest that the presence that at one has a significant positive impact on company success in obtaining a mark et nonetheless the overwhelming majority of researchers in latin america in and government research laboratories spending their entire stimulating the mobility of advanced human capital between sectors collaboration increase the relevance of academic research boost of the private sector to absorb are many reasons underlying low mobility of researchers in latin are often not sufficiently attractive for young researchers and does not as adding enough value in addition views that a career industry is of academic values still exist among academics in the region et al programs targeted at enhancing mobility may be an effective mechanism trust for further most common approach is to encourage researchers to seek employment and industry for example professors can be granted the right to remain on the or teaching loads while working in industry another approach currently in argentina is to scholarships to young researchers working in are temporary and decline in value of time with the company share of the salary a evaluation of a researcher program surveying young researchers and participating companies found of scholarship holders were still employed in industry after the had indicating that the program had mobility of advanced human capital from industry to universities also to both companies and universities in latin america options include researchers to with university professors in carrying out or as staff using their knowledge of the private sector prepare the of researchers for a career outside research clusters science parks and to relationships can also take a success of silicon valley and other famous hubs has heightened interest america of how to support cluster formation clusters comprise firms suppliers and investors that work together in close physical to design new technologies products and enterprises porter the clusters have developed spontaneously instruments such as science and research partnerships may give an impetus to innovation processes in between different parts of the system attract and the rest of the america features a number of notably in argentina and state of paulo in brazil is home to one of the very few mature the region manufacturing industry is among the largest and most diverse in latin reasons behind the success are many investments in advanced education between public and private researchers have undoubtedly to the success plonski paulo is the intellectual universities and research centers in brazil and most of publications of campinas for example boasts the highest number of brazil in addition for several decades a fixed percentage of state tax has to science and technology and concentrated in stability in funding has allowed the state to build a strong science base attract researchers a key factor in the success of the region is the strong public research institutions and industry according to quandt firms in the city of campinas mentioned universities and laboratories dominant providers of research and new knowledge firms also refer to predominant source of highly skilled number of countries in latin america are establishing or considering science in order research collaboration among others the polo ptc in buenos aires argentina is an attempt to stimulate the made up of several public research institutions including the national of industry outreach activities include a program to stimulate new courses in entrepreneurship and technical assistance the ptc with research clusters and science institutions around the parks in latin america are often overshadowed by the fact that the are subsidized ptc for example depends almost exclusively on public low private sector commitment cassin bortagaray public is not only a financial problem but may have a negative effect also the science parks initiatives are likely to be less responsive actual less able to promote collaborative relationships and may lock a region an which will eventually face decline de ferranti et instrument adopted in some latin american countries is support for partnerships companies can benefit in a number of ways from such industries technological developments are occurring too rapidly and too to be managed effectively with staff alone at the with university researchers may be a way for small and their own limited resources aicum chile and mexico a new initiative brings together universities and industry work together on research issues of common interest consortia are partially with but all required to make and research partnerships differ from science parks in their need to come together and formulate a proposal in order to obtain based on clearly formulated projects whose success or failure depends on of to conduct research together hence strong incentives exist to make and collaboration intellectual property regulations and direct of trying to diffuse knowledge universities may be directly involved one option is for researchers and students to bring their ideas to market by companies in a legal framework outside the university universities also through patents and licenses and thereby sell research results to regulations on technology transfer can provide researchers a pay attention to possible practical applications of their work and to in efforts that potential research on the landmark act in the united shows sharing a high proportion of royalty revenue with staff generate patents income lach and schankerman this implies that universities knowledge transfer by revising incentive structures universities in america in have not regulated how rewards from intellectual property are shared academic departments and the institution rather intellectual is dealt a basis mullin as commercial activity develops region will face the need to explicitly regulate how generated income is newly arising phenomenon within the context of linkages researchers as individuals or in conjunction with their research results through the creation of companies increasingly seen as important means for enhancing local economic to universities and encouraging successful scientist to become ventures may fill a critical gap in cases where technologies remain involvement in business creation implies a new role of scientists addition to of innovators and advisors they are now required to be members of play an important role in identifying and developing business and organizing the venture norden much attention in recent years there are only few examples in latin staff setting up companies the school of at university in chile has one of the most extensive experiences in the since university has supported the creation of five companies which and students mullin further stimulating the establishment of in latin america requires governments and universities to clearly define on and establish appropriate support structures to companies in formative and students typically have little private sector experience and may assistance to package a technology into a marketable product establish a viable model a company moreover dedicated efforts to increase the size of private and markets in latin america would likely contribute to the creation of managing conflicts of interest in and private companies have different priorities in regard to the of from joint research projects academics are rewarded for publishing have an interest in gaining a first mover advantage by concealing potential competitors hence it is important that the bargaining process leads for research collaboration brings clarity on the issue of a is to agree on a maximum that may constrain a university publication hernes and martin most collaboration agreements delay submission of an academic paper for two or three months to secure when phd students are involved in a joint project it is important guard against where thesis research becomes unpublishable due to corporate secrecy should be informed at the outset of any confidentiality and bhef clash between traditional values of universities and firms emerge also case of university vestergaard illustrates how creating in a raised questions about the boundaries between the duties of as employees in a company in most countries in latin america such mexico academic staff has specific employment conditions which indicate their and of time they are expected to spend on teaching and research such a frame of reference for the time that can be dedicated to private the university paulo in brazil for example has established that a staff member is under and with the permission of the head of the institution to take day of leave for private consultancy under the condition that the work should the of the academic and of the department polonski with industry may also cause a direct conflict of interests for cases where firms offer them financial rewards via royalties and equity in funding their research especially in the field of medicine evidence that cooperate closely with industry are less likely to disseminate their results et al and are more likely to publish results favorable to eg bero conflicts of interest are thus a justified concern as they may the quality and diminish public perception of and trust in universities and the for example obliges researchers to disclose financial interests applying public research funding cho et may often need to support academic values with internal in order their position in society as collaboration in latin current treatment by most universities will likely be for core values and universities will face the need to establish and review university to the needs of national innovation systems has prompted to revise their traditional functions but also their governance increased flexibility in university higher education systems in latin america have been by inflexible public sector management rules in many latin american the ministry used to determine budget allocations student admission policies content and institutions had little influence on the number of staff and the level or promotions schwartzman the traditional rigid state model ineffective in the new reality notably in regard to resource universities increasingly are held accountable for external funding productivity quality universities must have greater freedom to maneuver and be in so can truly take responsibility for their success and failure as a the government and university is changing in many latin american example the constitution guarantees the largest universities greater governing personnel policy and academic programs world bank in latin america are currently contemplating how to balance accountability for results colombia for instance is allocating a fixed of public budget for tertiary education based on results and chile is in process performance agreements negotiated between the ministry of universities thorn et al such instruments hold significant universities to increasingly take societal needs into account in and trend of decentralization in latin america extends from the also to individual departments university management regarding external contracts and funding allocations require the rector cumbersome in the new environment in an increasing number of universities external contracts and decisions about funding allocations can now be at level many universities retain the legal practice that the is needed for commitments but in cases where central approval is still needed the been revised and simplified mullin higher level of autonomy demands on managerial capacity at the decentralized level this changes role of department heads and deans from merely a representative of fellow to and manager of an organization amaral et al managing

subscribe via community participation in innovation start with by how do companies spark and sustain community involvement in processes while successful examples like kickstarter designs prove this is feasible clearly no easy task one that depends on each unique set of users our examination of successful companies and my experience working online communities suggest four tips to begin understanding engaging community members in innovative when considering motivations think and not innovators typically recognize the need to understand what drives users but often start with the wrong question instead of what motivates our users innovators often start by asking are intrinsically or extrinsically motivated by framing understanding around this tradeoff innovators presuppose that primarily fall into one of two categories and often limit focus to one primary motivation such as money or instead advocate a different approach avoid this tradeoff entirely instead build a comprehensive list of all potential motivators as saw in the innocentive case community members are driven by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as reward intellectual curiosity and recognition sure your approach may appeal to one motivation over another however ruling out options before you have to by considering all factors may inspire community not all about discussions about extrinsic rewards typically focus on money innovators to ignore other relevant factors in its entirety encompasses any factors coming from outside the individual many which have nothing to do with profit and which may motivate engagement for instance threadless community members monetary rewards for design reviews yet are extrinsically motivated a sense of participation and recognition from other community in my experience uncovering such motivations starts understanding the nature of how your community interacts how do communicate with relate to perceive one another and team by understanding how users interact and respond to behavior you can begin assessing how to appeal to their make it feel whether asked for content reviews or simply dialogue users contribute unless participation feels encouraged and safe to this environment innovators need to understand and minimize risks and psychological barriers think about your request and users will react will they worry about privacy compare themselves other users perceive any baseline requirements to contribute innocentive demonstrates anonymity may help reduce these concerns equalizing the playing field and protecting however transparency can also help by suggesting rules as we saw with threadless publicizing comments and reviews facilitate dialogue encourage participation from various and reduce the perceived risk of offering opinions this often works best when users are already actively participating some degree and these techniques depend on ie sensitivity required expertise and desired however one thing is clear innovators must identify and barriers to engagement if they want to incorporate communities their articulate the innovators often explain why they want communities to get involved always provide insights into final results within the while sharing results of contributions may seem obvious often proves hard to achieve in practice for instance companies often have time to aggregate and share statistics worry about backlash if they post results that differ from initial goals however as openideo demonstrates users care about their impact and want to understand what happened with ideas in my experience while users care most about their ideas implemented virtually any insights into participation and results can help users feel more engaged and while innovators typically implement all user ideas simple metrics like total number of submissions or lists of tackled can help prove to users their shared passion and commitment the community and hopefully spark more ultimately these tips provide a starting point for community involvement in innovation up to innovators to unique approaches to address their specific community dynamics and perceived risks however these steps help guide innovators to ask the right questions avoid roadblocks begin understanding how to best inspire communities to contribute to what other elements do you believe are critical to achieving involvement which companies provide the

threadless keys to by crowdsourcingsay it with this buzzword part jargon part grammatical compound increasing frequency through the halls of silicon valley incubators business schools so what is crowdsourcing is a distributed problem solving process that uses large group of people crowd to take responsibility for part of activities while this process may differ from one business another it often involves sourcing innovation activities like product ideation design and selection to the crowd see cbs overview of threadless one of the best known crowdsourcing companies uses community of million artists and consumers to design and and other d art designs the top scoring designs are produced and sold through the online store and through success has spawned a veritable gold rush of interest crowdsourcing lookk fashion lego cuusoo toys invention innocentive corporate creative agency and jewelry are just a few of the companies rushing to bring crowdsourcing to new categories and with the proliferation of new crowdsourcing businesses helpful understand some of the key factors that influence their success there are many aspects to building a successful crowdsourcing below are three factors that i believe have particularly crowdsourcing requires the active participation of a community to and maintain this engagement crowdsourcing businesses must participation there has been extensive research and discussion the intrinsic extrinsic and prosocial motives used in see motivations for crowdsourcing while the types motivations required will vary from one business to another companies must work hard to understand the factors that drive community members and build structures that support one way that threadless promotes voter participation is by individual voting history each community member has a homepage shows the number of times voted on designs and how many these designs were printed showing members the impact helping designs get printed prosocial motivation encourages specialization creating crowdsourcing companies also benefit from creating boundaries for projects and business activities crowdjewel focuses solely on jewelry and is building a community that loves to create purchase discuss jewelry design and products this specialization ensures when crowdjewel posts designs they already have an audience eager to engage if instead they posted designs for necklaces one and power tools the next they would have to constantly recruit types of community members whose interests may be in conflict would reduce the engagement and participation operational one thing to build a successful crowdsourcing community but another to build a profitable business operations and are how crowdsourcing businesses make their money specialization only helps build strong communities but also allows businesses focus on products with very similar manufacturing requirements lego case all products literally rely on the same blocks legos while this example is a bit extreme the idea critical specialization allows the community to innovate while streamlining operations focusing on operational enables companies to profitably produce any product that is within the bounds of the community without these boundaries would be forced to introduce new materials suppliers and processes every new product this would create tremendous complexity dramatically increase costs and manufacturing these are just a few of the many factors that impact businesses what factors do you think make or break the model and what new verticals are ripe for disruption thoughts comments tagged as community engagement crowdjewel innocentive innovation motivations threadless scouting more human capital talent from the by i know i know permit me if you will another exploration of linsanity phenomenon taking the world by storm as applied to managing innovation course in full disclosure not an basketball fan nor do i claim to have followed jeremy before he became famous as with the new york knicks i captivated by what hearing and learning i am fascinated with details of his story and his rise to the top as it applies innovation i enjoyed reading robert leadership article in forbes week entitled what ceos can learn from jeremy httpaddr one of key insights is to identify superstar on your bench and as reiss went through calculating above average achievements before his fateful breakthrough determined that lin recognized yet because he was still the radar just waiting for an opportunity to finally that moment came when coach mike after just one great made lin a starter and the rest was history to is that they should look under the radar in your analyze of overlooked businesses or current smaller markets seek breakthrough ideas from the depth of your and view carefully potentially overlooked data because there may be superstar on the now this makes a lot of sense to me and the cases of threadless and openideo support this these companies are with building more interesting and diverse human capital through their open communal platforms external talent pools better identify a broader range of superstars early and challenges even provide extra incentive to test out and see if people shine with prospective applicants submitting opeideo entries as part of their application process for employment i wanted to underscore this point around talent discovery with excerpt from an interview that reiss does in his story with chen ceo of ge media finance about jeremy lin michael chen reiss every corporation has hidden jeremy in organization i am talking about employees who have the potential to become future but for one reason or another have yet to be discovered corporations get bigger bureaucracy inevitably creeps in companies create several layers of management between employees senior leaders making it very difficult for these jeremy to discovered therefore companies should create a process that potential superstar employees an opportunity to showcase their in front of senior innocentive has a process it taps into the creative surplus knowledge workers who have energy to burn and a desire for cash recognition in a formalized competition forum threadless runs their competitions where designers are not buried in muck but have close direct access to audience feedback loops who spot and vote on the talent then and there and where the team can hire the designers that keep rocking out the wins in these cases the bureaucracy is strategically kept to a minimum reduced layers of approval and red tape dividing creators or at least creators in these companies have access to managers and i think these competitive forums are essential for innovation and crucial in spotting out the next jeremy lins that lurk right under the radar because they give folks opportunities to their abilities in formalized ways and while both these cases examples of engaging more external talent outside the company demonstrate skill and innovation by contributing their ideas i argue that these formalized platforms for competition are needed as much internally within organizations in order to spark boost employee morale and tap into latent creativity that exists as an example of this i struggled with ways to promote talent within organizations as a former executive recruiter and human manager i most recently worked with the public schools system washington dc where i was trying to figure out in this governmental bureaucracy how to better access more innovative creative ideas from the central office staff that hailed different parts of the school system to solve challenges increasing parental engagement incorporating more teacher feedback central office policies impacting teaching and learning streamlining business operations we also struggled to recognize across different departments it was challenging for some managers and entering workers who were hungry to demonstrate skill figure out how to continue to advance in career paths once they got and became very good in their original to this end we piloted central innovation teams that would staff more opportunities across the organization to showcase talents and unlock them from their assigned jobs and rotate through different offices on shorter term projects they could employ more creativity and bring their perspectives but some of the impact was limited employees to be on different assigned teams and the challenges were by lessons learned given some of the lessons taken away from cases i would design more of an ideas competition

the iphone to virtually every ces honoree surrounded by innovations that embody jason principle and provide meaning to users through simplicity in use design however achieving such simplicity straightforward as just being minimalist or hiding complexity meaningful simplicity requires striking a balance saying no to unnecessary features removing so much functionality that the innovation oversimplified and devalued while examining successful provide a formula or even a process critical shared elements emerge which suggest a starting point achieving the right level of solve a core problem or all decisions should relate back to the core problem or idea solved this may seem obvious but proves difficult in practice innovators consider numerous benefits and therefore risk fatigue rather than pursue a breadth of problems innovators harness the power of really by asking what problem they really seek to solve and using that idea to product decisions for example process incorporates methodology by uncovering the key underlying principle of problem certainly some innovations solve more than problem and many offer multiple benefits that appeal to different segments however companies achieving meaningful simplicity their innovation to an overarching problem and use this as a to ask themselves which features promote or detract from a appeal to basic human innovation achieves true meaning by identifying and resonating basic human needs innovators must first identify which underscore the problem being solved such as growth connection participation and then evaluate if and how each new fulfills that need for instance bang olufsen focuses on to the basic human needs for pleasure confirmation and which helps drive emotional connection to their products spark dialogue by taking this approach innovators connections between users and their products while improving ability to distinguish between critical and less impactful understand and integrate human ideally innovations solve new problems while minimizing the amount behavioral change required to accomplish these seemingly goals innovators must understand how individuals will use and with the product and anchor functionality in this behavior as seen this approach can take many forms from team new usability testing to surveys to design approach of analyzing wants interactions while these techniques vary based on core competencies and talent all incorporate user as a critical element of innovation during the design process not only speeds adoption since less work is required by users but helps innovators eliminate excess features based on what users actually some might argue that principle suggests complex are meaningless however this view misses the key distinction innovations can still achieve meaning provided the complexity intentional and arguably rooted in the three steps instance intricate biotechnology devices often require features to solve such complicated problems which may also engineers from hiding design engineering however this complexity still fits argument sure additional might further enhance meaning but these requirements and appeal directly to human needs physical health while presumably incorporating human ultimately this framework provides a starting point for meaningful simplicity even if a formulaic process existed this balance requires both art and science and depends upon resources and core competencies however by starting with steps innovators can make decisions that guide them towards meaningful simplicity

simulation drive the innovation process in your organization the role of simulation changing over time what are some of the involved in relying on simulation can simulation more value to our customers in the innovation process as the innovation or general managers these are some of the we need to think about here i would like to bring my expertise using simulation for several innovation throughout my career which includes my doctoral work and years figure figure experience in the team new zealand case hbs we discussed doug peterson integrated simulation in designing the racing yacht the cup figure illustrates the innovation process by tnz which is typical in many companies in this case the task was primarily driven by experimental learning through prototype tests and yacht tests represented by the arrow between experiment and innovation in figure here the purpose of the simulation was to reduce the number of experiments prototype tests in the design space and optimizing the final instead of driving the design process limited influence of on the other two illustrated by dotted line in figure experience his creativity and tacit knowledge limited initial design space which i call it an experience envelope shown figure each of the denotations represents design concepts of the yacht explored by experiment and respectively if no simulation was used all of the design space have been explored with experiments e which is both expensive time consuming as a result of using simulation tnz could speed up development process to certain extent and reduce costs in building large number of what if a better innovation concept is outside the experience that can create more value to your customers this quickly poses constraint on the resources involved to explore broader design using experiments under this constraint would it be possible reduce the number of experiments and divert the resources to for exploring broader design spaces that may include radical or incrementally better than the ones in the experience envelope how can we speed up the time to market to benefit our customers challenges need a paradigm shift in how simulation is used in innovation process which is illustrated through an example wing development program and summarized into a new for figure wind tunnel test of a prototype plane at mit source in the s boeing used to solely rely on wind tunnel tests designing aircraft wings an example wind tunnel prototype test at is shown in figure in the wing development process as many different wing designs were tested by building prototypes their latest model prototyping was reduced to wing designs did boeing achieve this dramatic reduction of in wind testing boeing attributes this success to the computational dynamics cfd capabilities and the advances in computer hardware software over the recent years furthermore director airplane performance stated that a wing design resulted in configuration that could not have been designed without cfd tools and high performance computing it is worth highlighting a couple of important points here boeing not achieve this success overnight but took a approach where the cfd tools were being perfected to match experimental data this process is called validation in the community where experimental data is compared against simulations a wide range of conditions if huge discrepancies are observed simulation models will be either redefined or refined iteratively agreement between the two is achieved in other words the process eliminates the risk some of us raised this point in our discussion of relying more on simulation for design decisions case wind tunnel test results from the prototypes of matched the cfd predictions with this validated simulation boeing is now on a path to completely drive the conceptual preliminary design phases of future wing development programs simulation in this approach wind tunnel tests only be used for validation of the final design emerged simulation this would allow boeing to reduce the wind tunnel from to or and speed up the development process from to months or the framework for innovation can be described shown in figure figure here the primary purpose of the experiments fewer than traditional approach is to validate the simulation and configurations of the design for this reason a broken line is used represent the limited dependence between experiment and once the simulation is validated it can be used to explore outside the experience envelope which i call an innovation envelope shown in figure figure innovation as fewer experiments result in lower costs these resources can now allocated to explore more design concepts which increases the created in the innovation process please notice and compare relative magnitudes of in figure

pyramid where the of billion poor people are largely unmet companies around the have been trying to transform these poor people into consumers decades now but their efforts have yielded very little success is largely due to a lack of innovation in how base of the consumers are most companies go into these markets with the premise that people the base of the pyramid are like people at the top of the with less money the strategy has therefore been to sell them the products more cheaply while lower income levels certainly do define a core identity and aspirations they do define every aspect of a context and needs so while human values aspirations may be universal a concrete value will not apply across all levels of the economic pyramid for gillette recently spent millions of dollars developing a new for the indian market and tested the product on indian men studying mit the test yielded great results and gillette launched the in india where it was a complete flop it turned out that unlike countrymen in the us indian consumers have reliable access running water or a comfortable bathroom to shave in so the new was impossible for them to companies trying to serve the base of the pyramid would do better recognize their target differences and not expect low to be sufficient to win this untapped segment over companies need realize that winning the fortune at the base of the pyramid is not simple matter of pricing but rather of innovation at every level of business model many of the innovative companies we admire like and bang olufsen are built off of understanding their target so well that they even need to ask her what she wants they just like her they know what she wants before she does and design products that make intuitive sense to her and fit into her effortlessly unfortunately most companies targeting the base of pyramid have this insider knowledge of their consumer they make flawed assumptions about how similar the base of the will be to their existing consumer base and attempt to force fit existing designs and business models to serve the poor so how do understand a consumer who is nothing like you and who you have market data design provides a valuable tool to understand context in which people use products but when targeting the base of pyramid it requires even more time and resource investments usual after its first failure at reaching the base of the pyramid india gillette went back to the drawing board it launched innovation process with a laser focus on gaining insight into target market a team of gillette employees spent thousands of hours the ground in india to truly understand the consumer the team time in homes on shopping trips and watching people armed with its new insights the gillette team designed a new razor and used its understanding of the consumer in planning aspect of the business model including marketing and distribution new gillette guard gained market share in its first quarter is now the razor in some might see this need for consumer insight design as an obstacle to doing business at the base the pyramid i see it as an incredible opportunity most companies still years away from recognizing the potential of this huge market and light years away from mobilizing themselves to do about it but top of the pyramid markets are saturated and within them is fading for those that are willing to innovate to an entirely new consumer base there is a huge opportunity to create fortune at the base of the pyramid clearly a few companies placing big bets on this idea has launched a sort of project that sends teams deep into the field to immersed in the lives of poor people observe and design products those insights in mind also recently launched an innovation in beijing with the aim to research source and develop locally though this is a long term game initial results suggest investing in this new type of innovation has the potential to the fortune at the base of the tagged as base of the pyramid innovation revealing by in the case of innocentive we saw that individuals participate in open platform to work on problems and challenges faced organizations individuals propose their solutions and share innovation with the organizations the motivation to freely their innovation could either be intrinsic or extrinsic moreover benefits of revealing innovation might exceed the benefits of it a secret on the other hand firms too reveal their innovations free there are several such examples but i will quote one example my work experience i worked at sun microsystems developing ultrasparc t microprocessor the then ceo jonathan schwartz was in favor of open source and freely distributed software in did the unthinkable in the microprocessor industry by open sourcing complete design of ultrasparc this was big because none of commercially successful processor design had been made open this chip boasted of some cool innovations in chip cmt and implementing and core on a so why did sun open source its by making the source for this design available for a larger to review and learn from we expect that ideas around the concepts can be explored more freely and openly and that beneficial innovations can be achieved benefits at the time of introduction of this processor there were few software applications that could really take advantage of parallel processing capabilities of this processor it was important develop lots and lots of applications that demonstrated the power cmt sun open sourced its hardware to develop a community of developers who could write more free software especially on the platform they also engaged academia to encourage research on architecture all these initiatives were in line with model of being a systems company sun sold software and hardware as whole system rather than individual components so open sourcing design made risks on the other hand there was this risk of patent risk of losing competitive edge over competitors and also loss of revenue these risks were never significant because at time only sun and fujitsu were the leading sparc vendors fujitsu also partner in developing some processor product line the battle was for the dominance of processor architecture so adoption of sparc architecture was necessary to confront architecture and x strategy of open sourcing the design had its benefits the risks sun went on to open source ultrasparc t processor as but after oracle acquiring sun there are no further design releases the freely revealing secrets has its own benefits in this diversifying sources of innovation and also increasing adoption to this is an example of asking the right question and having the to execute it as jason randal puts it one of the secrets innovation is to ask the right tagged as diversification hardware microprocessor open source some business functions intrinsically not by when looking back at our classes to date i was surprised with variety we discussed the process of innovating products as with olufsen and apple discussed innovating the intangible such flavors and fragrances discussed innovative business such as of solutions to problems even discussed innovative service offerings in the form of new but then i noticed a common theme all of the innovation in cases related to the line functions once could argue that discussed innovation from the corporate function but it ultimately to create a product change selfishly i started to about innovation within corporate functions as someone who will going into hr after graduation could i innovate for my firm or i be relegated to supporting the innovation efforts of is innovative within corporate functions desirable is it possible a class we have defined innovation in two ways invention or novelty value though not sure corporate functions would should be striving for novelty inventing useful solutions is a thing across every part of the firm as for its possibility innovation the classic traps rosabeth moss kanter wide spectrum including technologies processes and complete business ventures hbr november it department can create an innovative internal tool or the finance department can develop an innovative are there restrictions on which functions can innovate i was unable find a common definition of corporate functions however these support roles include finance human resources it risk management and with some variation by industry even at first glance some appear to be more likely to innovate than others and strategy can imagine on the cutting edge while an innovative legal might do more harm than good however if we emphasize innovation across corporate functions i argue that there should be limit to where innovation is beneficial even within the department for example employees can suggest improvements knowledge management as it relates to patents or open claims the are some functions more likely to be recognized for solutions just because functions particularly finance resources and risk management can innovate probably do innovate mean that their innovations will recognized internally or externally but why those getting credit in my opinion the corporate functions that do credit for innovations strategy it provide innovations to the line managers the form of new product features new customer segments to target technology and tools or new marketing campaigns this is in to innovations generated by the functions which typically related to processes within the function so why is it an issue if some functions get credit innovation i believe in the long term it will discourage functions from proposing creative and improvements to firm processes which leaves money on the table for firm even if a proposed innovation does not have a direct link revenues it may improve the efficiency and effectiveness of a corporate functions this can lead both to a leaner structure with a higher employee ratio and to employees providing better support such as richer data regarding patents other ip given the potential value of innovations it is critical for managers to and acknowledge innovations from across the firm not just related to the tagged as corporate innovation functions innovation organizational structure key is in the by if i had asked people what they wanted they would have said henry among innovators this famous adage has oft been subject for some such as bang olufsen designer david lewis argue people do not truly know what they want and it is up to gifted with unique creativity and technical knowledge to innovation to new bounds others believe true innovation comes meeting consumer needs and no one knows these needs better consumers while there is value in this debate i believe this discussion must preceded by a much more important and challenging what questions should innovators ask in the first great innovation only occurs if you ask the right questions innovator and master magician jason randal says all good at answering the wrong questions the challenge is asking right if ford asked people what they wanted they would never have the model t in the average person had neither the knowledge nor vision to conceive of personalized motor transport the same time however if ford asked the right questions the would not have been faster innovators must push beyond the surface of consumer needs deeper to understand the core principles at hand in case core need was the ability to move from one place to another as as possible once this insight is discovered it is the job innovators to apply their technical knowledge and creative abilities address this need in novel ways faster horses hoverboards teleportation would all improve transit speed but ford recognized opportunity to combine technology and new manufacturing techniques bring the combustion engine to the mass so how do we find and recognize the right steve jobs answered this question by breaking the inquiry innovation process into three when you start looking at a problem and it seems really with all these simple solutions you really understand complexity of the problem and your solutions are way oversimplified then you get into the problem and you see really complicated and you come up with all the where most people stop and the solutions tend work for a while but the really great person will keep on and findthe key underlying principle of the problem and come with a beautiful elegant solution that applying this framework to situation results in the stage we need a faster stage getting a faster horse is tough we need generations careful breeding and training and improvements may still stage horses the solution at all we need a faster of personal while these steps will vary across different industries and challenges understanding this framework can guide innovators the iterative questioning i agree with approach and his belief that most people finish stage two stopping at stage two leads to new products and that are better than those previously in existence the however are marginal at best great leaps in innovation come perseverance pushing to stage three where you can ask questions result in novel and unexpected do you agree with approach are these the right stages or we view innovation through a different lens your comments and are welcome austin r beyersdorfer d bang olufsen design

innovation as an prior to hbs i worked as an engineer in the advanced department samsung electronics in south korea my training in engineering me to come up with multiple solutions to interesting problems but those solutions innovative some of them were definitely novel received validation through patent filings having not received formal training on innovation up until my time at hbs how did i do at samsung was i just lucky on retrospection i used inadvertently the concepts highlighted in our managing class at define the problem challenge the first thing i always did was to define the problem i often myself what exactly is the problem while defining the problem became very natural for me to also question the existing often times that helped me to come very close to the final for example in one of our demos to the ceo of samsung he told me design a kv power supply with a depth of less than mm to give an idea of the challenge the depth of our demo version was initially i thought he was kidding but subsequent from our task force proved me wrong i had to come up with a design in less than months for the consumer electronics show ces las vegas though i had the support system of my boss and colleagues was the lead on this project and had to come up with the idea getting to mm design through a couple of our brainstorming we discovered that our mm design was primarily due to a transformer we had assumed from the very that hvts need to be thick we challenged this assumption and now problem was to come up with a thin version of hvt we did some research identified companies to outsource the and were able to send the mm design to come up with a simple back in the school days i enjoyed solving mathematical questions participated in many national level competitions i reached a point time when i used to have multiple solutions to any single problem naturally decided by asking myself which is the simplest though i lost touch with tricky math questions over time subconsciously internalized the process of coming up with solutions as an engineer i like examples because they prove the right away so here is another relevant example when we were on d tvs one of the problems we faced was what if in a house of members two want to view the tv in a d format and the other two in d format some of the early ideas were to add a lcd display on remote control or come up with a handheld portable tablet that the tv that would be cool but would that really solve the who would want to watch on a small display when a bigger and tv is right in front in a team of two we persistently ourselves to believe that there be a better to the long story short we finally came up with a switch on the d that would enable the viewer to seamlessly switch from d to d that simple yet prototype test prototyping was very common in my field whenever we came up with idea and saw its potential through preliminary simulations it necessary to come up with a proof of concept prototype often the was not as expected due to elements that are difficult to model in simulation that constant revision to get the desired performance in the process making revisions we sometimes came up with new ideas that changed for better our initial direction of getting to the solution hence i have been very convinced with the idea prototyping the only examples i have are very technical

great invention helps achieve a specific intent by providing a tool to convert that into action thus cars help people to be independent by convenient flexible transportation the internet helps people to more closely linked to one another by allowing instant transmission rich communication crawley went on to present a formalized structure for what he system problem statements which started to call statements the form that crawley proposed and that been using the to what is the intent you are trying to by by what function will you achieve the using what is the form of the invention which will achieve intended an example of this came from bill lecture in that he that intention to help people tell by providing digital using the personal and thus a revolution in the world of video editing was so what is so powerful about this framework from the perspective managing innovation i feel looking at groundbreaking new through this lens has three huge advantages over traditional first intention provides a focus on what exactly it is are trying to achieve all too often inventors will look at the part of the statement this is where new widgets come from that allow us to do the same old thing always done but faster or cheaper or with a sexier look to really good inventors will go another level upstream to look at by part of the statement this is what is typically done by who say they are practicing user centered this opens up huge space for innovation since the inventor now has no boundaries the form by which they will achieve their however what if we push ourselves even further to look at the of the invention we come to consider the actual motivation that drive a enthusiasm for our product or service stripped away any notion of the design space or solution consider our intention in a way that is totally allows us to shed any preconceived notions of the means we will use the forms we will employ to really achieve what our customers the second reason this is framework is so powerful is that anthropomorphising the process only a sentient being can truly intent it forces the innovator to explicitly discretely precisely identify who the invention we saw many instances in this course of where design teams wasted huge amount of time by not discretely identifying their intent led to disagreements iterations and delays consider the for example what was the intent of the team denmark campaign was to win the competition or was it to promote the company had intent been explicitly discussed and agreed by the team then the of the design process may have been much less controversial the and using aspects of the design would have been much easier to i have seen this time and time again in companies and sure have too where groups of managers disagree about what the should be doing the by and how they should be doing it but really the disagreement is often about what they want to without first agreeing on the intention managers are to disagree on finally establishing a intention allows an to be extremely agile while the tools and methods by which an may be achieve can change the intent itself remains the same this particularly valuable in the volatile business world which we all intend to thrive face it your competitors eventually develop a higher performing technology flashier campaign slicker user interface or better manufacturing process yours if designed your product around any of these sunk if started from you intention and have all of your decisions according to that intent you will continue to on the right if those of you expert in this field will forgive my saying so exceptional example of the power of intention comes from strategy one of the reasons that smaller elite military units often so effective is that they rely not on a series of commands to the job done instead these units will often operate on the basis what they call the like our intent these specify the goal the to but now how it is to achieved by or what tools using will be used to do so gives a leader in the field incredible latitude the flexibility adapt to changing circumstances the ability to choose the best at her disposal the ability to change tactics as the mission this flexibility and adaptability can certainly help us as as on the bleeding edge of new product and service development landscape is always changing tools we have at our disposal evolving faster than we can keep up with them and repeating our tactics is a sure way to fail in an intensely competitive remaining focused on our and our intents will provide us stable compass to navigate the more time i spend with this framework the more it provides to me on so many of the challenges we face as innovators from an invention to aligning an organization behind it to designing enterprise that will capture the value that flows from it be interested to hear your thoughts on how applicable this framework intentional innovation would be to your tagged as adaptability agile innovation intent the by by evan in a previous blog post i highlighted three challenges corporations face in managing innovation these strategic myopia corporations often do not see outside their immediate field of structural inertia if they do spot opportunities they are not up to execute them inefficient relationships with outside innovators take a reactive approach to buying external innovations corporations would be involved at the problem identification rather than at the solution selection companies should take a more proactive approach to engaging with external innovation contests are and fast ways to solutions to specific problems companies can define innocentive solutions to very specific technical using its solver network through this contest platform solvers compensated for their ip which is then transferred to corporations using triz methodology gen partners discovers solutions to problems using its own expert network high reject rate in the semiconductor industry becomes a problem and the champagne industry knows how to control ideo and other design firms generate ideas for products and businesses even mckinsey is good at solving problems albeit the executives i interviewed recognize that these consultants operate more inside the while these firms offer inspiration ideas and knowledge of the points that both companies and your customers face any generated must be executed by the client firm ip from transfers ownership to the client ideo may provide a prototype of product but the client must adopt it for full scale mckinsey provides a powerpoint deck with in this way solutions are constrained by the imperative to implemented by the corporate from a view this approach makes sense these firms new uses for existing capabilities and products however once features are refined the flexibility to transfer these attributes to other contexts is companies that adopt a more approach and engage the external innovation community in a proactive manner would be with even greater growth opportunities customers have a limitless changing array of problems a company that owns a customer can turn itself into a platform and invite other firms to plug into the company or its customers could then decide which products best suited to addressing customer pain contests may be run not only for discovering ideas or ip but also the execution of these companies can use a contest mechanism to discover and filter innovations as with innocentive companies would post based on specific pain points they would like to address the points could be their own or those of their innocentive however the output of these challenges would businesses or products not just ip or a powerpoint the benefits of this proactive contest approach rather than reactive approach that most companies take in buying innovations through and corporate venture capital reduced information asymmetries and search costs for development professionals business development executives may be aware of all developments outside their companies the method sources and organizes inbound requests from startups in more exhaustive reduced information asymmetries for entrepreneurs are searching for pain points to solve and default to what they in their field of vision communicating pain points would more entrepreneurial activity in specific areas of interest corporations and their customers additionally entrepreneurs want to sell to or partner with corporations but they may not which companies are receptive to or in need of their a better filter business development executives complain that receive requests for partnership from startups a would be helpful as would a translation service that startups understand the appropriate way to plug into less costly development with higher quality outcomes vs internally with a separate unit or outsourcing to a single prof christensen suggests that firms could solve the dilemma by utilizing a separate business unit this works large initiatives that need to integrated to some degree with the rest of the the execution of innovation would be appropriate building complements apple app developers second sources supply pepsi using holland sweetener against specialty service providers at points of modularity a gas asking for a private label fuel distributor against or initiatives target asking for a app that will replace its loyalty program and smaller ideas will not move the needle microsoft asking entrepreneurs to a mobile service at office buildings to replace enables work to be done in parallel with reward for the best solutions at the end of the better ideas solutions would not be constrained by the strategic unique solutions these are likely not initiatives that ideo partners innocentive or mckinsey would suggest because they not designed to be implemented internally by the a problem nike is facing is that people are becoming sedentary exercising less and therefore buying fewer nike shoes of the solutions prepared by our class were designed for nike implement themselves if dual goal is to encourage potatoes to start exercising and also start buying gear why not issue a contest to external innovators nike communicate this problem accept applications from entrepreneurs other corporations that believe they can solve the problem with the winners as more couch potatoes begin nike will sell more shoes nike could maintain an relationship with these complements take a minority stake or nasa already runs a marketplace calling on researchers to utilize zero gravity international space station its problem is a problem not enough demand what if nasa nike ford ge and all were part of the same platform that aggregated companies with would have a centralized place to their priorities and the parameters of the interface that need to met for other firms to plug in and firms with solutions could the site for potential partners or customers the resulting would eliminate the need for rfps and potentially foster a collaborative innovation i would greatly appreciate feedback on this concept in the below also please post a comment if you know of any startups resemble this tagged as clay christensen clayton collaborative entrepreneurship collaborative corporate innovation evan shore ideo innovation community dilemma solution strategic myopia structural inertia by marked by the ability or power to create to creative having the quality of something created rather than imitated imaginative the creative from merriam webster i think we can all agree that creativity is vital period for any leader and an especially vital ingredient when it comes creativity is a characteristic given to all human beings at abraham maslow american professor of psychology creator hierarchy of to stimulate creativity one must develop the childlike for play and the childlike desire for recognition albert start by considering a common and debated question creativity is it innate or learned i tend to believe that it is a combination both that we all start with a given innate level of creativity sure some people are just more creative than but i that creativity can be taught and learned to a greater extent many people believe and i wonder is hbs or any business school that matter doing enough to help students relearn and their image source httpaddr there is proof and consensus that a child is generally much creative than his or her average adult counterpart when encouraged to play something tim brown feels is requirement for creativity and open and free with generation and communication for managing innovation students our marshmallow challenge for readers check the kindergarten children surely made us fools thankfully pitted against them in real timeor perhaps that would made the learning hit home a bit more so as we age we learn rules we experience dispense harsh judgmentand we begin to come to understand what types of ideas and answers are expected traditionally valued we aspire to please and fit the mold adult minds should be more creative we have a broader experience a richer mind of learning and memories that should act as the input more creative solutions and approaches to this tendency becomes stronger and more instilled as age we are subject to standardized tests as the measure achievement in the words of william j wilson a american sociologist but the person who scored well on an sat not necessarily be the best doctor or the best lawyer or the businessman these tests do not measure character creativity our left brain is prioritized celebrated and cultivated activities associated with our right brain are labeled a waste of and hobbies unlikely to result in any meaningful career our become extremely lopsided and especially for those of us through business education we begin to see ourselves as lopsided how many of you would as creative if not that you are creative throughout your growth into and through unlikely to believe that you are but remember we are all with innate creative just been largely trained educated out of image source httpaddr sir ken robinson an author speaker and advisor on education and quite the entertaining speaker has been telling story for years in his ted talk back in sir ken talks about educating people out of their creative apologies in advance to the professors in the audience who believes view their bodies as forms of transport for their sir ken robinson has been urging governments schools and companies to stress and think about teaching creativity for years to educate the entire body not just from the waist up and one side the brain in so the question is how should hbs be working to help us relearn see the value in our creativity acknowledging a curriculum change underway a few add play to the curriculum and not the pub crawl kind there endless possibilities campus murals students into business problems with little forcing students to display their logic and class visually having more blogs like this make a greater effort to attract students with artistic backgrounds those whose right brains have cultivated eg performing and classic arts exposure everyone create environments and projects where brainstorming a must consider our mi experiences in my opinion these types exercises and group projects are far too rare continue to encourage and support force students to get their hands dirty the only examples come to mind include the tom circuit board simulation and previously mentioned marshmallow challenge if discussing building a business we should hold and break the physical i leave these thoughts and questions in the hands of our professors dean nohria but as graduates we off the hook first work recognize and cultivate your own creativity be a for it but surely we aspire to lead more than ourselves so second considerhow can you create an where your company and employees recognize and cultivate creativity tagged as abraham maslow albert einstein innovation left brain right brain willian j wilson halo at virgin by following their famed mission statement to deliver experiences to customers that are expecting nothing less breakthrough innovations the now galactic virgin group continues push its way into industry after industry on february of this virgin announced its first commercial contracts to send customers space not even two months later virgin launched the formation of oceanic group which intends to enable pioneers and adventurers participate in deep sea oceanic exploration these two announcements aimed at truly exploring the final frontiers of environment and taking travelers to destinations only dreamed clearly place virgin and its talisman richard branson at forefront of innovation amidst these ambitious publications are the much more mundane forays into stale and industries like virgin america and most recently hotels the questions remain as innovative as branson and virgin be in their more exotic groups can they bring true disruption to core business units what allows virgin to continually push envelope or do they simply hide behind the pretense of innovation their endeavors and claim innovation in their other units as we learned in class too often innovation comes through iterations we fail to push past the barriers of what we already and remain stuck in the same mold virgin galactic and virgin undoubtedly push beyond what is commonly thought possible commercial travel but i would argue that they fail to bring little to the businesses that they are better known for virgin america instance specializes in long haul flights from major within the united states these routes were already occupied by competition in jetblue like jetblue virgin america offers channels of live television some flights with capabilities limited additional fees they did change up the mood lighting the cabin to mauve and fuchsia added class distinctions tickets and dressed up the flight attendants but aside putting lipstick on the pig what truly innovative things do provide and no not in the business model four years later they still do not make now we await the unveiling of virgin hotels which branson proclaims to be more than just a box with virgin stamped on the and hopefully the funnest hotel to go to as someone who comes the hotel industry i wait with baited breath to see where the innovations lie because branson says it will it make it so or will really just be another cement cube with a name plastered out yes there will probably be new features free for all continental breakfast and iterations on the current standards but cautiously hope the magic virgin dust will be sprinkled upon industry that so badly needs in reviewing virgin i wonder if the lesson to be learned here is exceptional marketing beats real solutions every time virgin is as one of the most imaginative companies in the world and in space ocean travel reality television and even monetizing necker island truly is but are we as customers so starved for true innovation these relatively small pieces of business purchase innovation equity to allow the company to be relatively everywhere else without criticism is the solution to take one or highly publicized highly creative bets and disregard success in name of achieving a halo effect of innovation for the rest of company i do not want to discount what virgin has accomplished but seems at the core that behind branson they are no different than rest of the companies who iterate instead

the most critical we can perform particularly when it comes to our elected regardless of their political affiliation amid the cacophony of culture identifying the truth is both harder and important

will help direct the conversation toward the truth as it happening so that americans get a fair shot at deciding this the truth teller prototype was built and runs with a combination several technologies some new some very familiar video and audio extraction with a technology to search database of facts and fact checks the post also worked with schultz creator of truth goggles as he

challenge winners have told me they nearly apply as they consider themselves enough that makes me wonder how many other potential winners have applied out of a misplaced concern that they think they fit trying to do to counteract that found it helps to talk people in person not just online about the contest last year at we met at least two teams who later applied and won the challenge on networks during an event at the driskill the network connie yowell of macarthur foundation that the digital and media learning challenges work because part of a larger community of innovators not sure that succeeded at building a community of media innovators that outside of the news challenge we may be getting there but we yet had a way to leverage our community towards a full exchange ideas counting that our new contest platform will ideation and the exchange of ideas we can only fund a handful projects but our hope moving forward is to build a news challenge which people stop at the application phase but conversations and collaborations between scale a couple of people in the meeting mentioned that struggle with how much to give to encourage entrepreneurship said they want to give enough to enable a project to get off ground but not so much as to assuage the need to innovate last we created a prototype fund in part as a way to address this made about a dozen investments so far when we assess our work in a few years i suspect find that the projects through the prototype fund will have had a greater than those funded through the news challenge one side effect that we route the more

from lack of time to produce the final as the judges mentioned they had a less project to work making it a tougher sell in the presentation but they came up some nice aspects such as the with an app

the scenes i spent the weekend around and talking to the teams so here are some additional and thoughts which you may find the team had some difficulty reconciling the brief given they feel they were likely to come up with the intricate d model capable of winning the challenge on prowess alone they were also not very familiar with so similarly to team captain cook they tried to play to strengths around design thinking and approach the challenge a more unique the team struggled a bit to decide on a solid direction though them d printing was useful for solving the unpredictable and coming up with a relevant d model was difficult do you the they also focussed on the human aspects of spaceflight and to let astronauts on a mission separated from the connect in a more tangible way with people back home they a child of an astronaut scanning and transmitting up their classroom creation eg a slightly wonky clay coffee mug impractical to drink from in space fathers on earth get to see touch that visual reminder of their like others with a relatively broad brief they too struggled decide on a firm direction until surprisingly this them most in the presentation aspect rather than the modelling the wheel they produced in the end was quite impressive and quickly turned out and definitely swayed judges however their presentation message was quite hard extract and left the judges quite bewildered i suspect would have benefited by sticking to one or two points only importantly ensuring one of these related to the wheel this was the first time seen d printing in person and definitely is very cool when d printers to end up on the station and in classrooms i can really imagine some tangible tactile interactions user icon markmackay space apps challenge captain mark mackay posted on apr challenge deployable team project page captain auckland placing placing third in the auckland judging for the international space challenge was team captain their challenge tasked them to design a greenhouse suitable on placed like the moon and mars the team have biology or engineering background so in tackling this task they took different approach with a focus on the humanisation of gardening other planets rather than trying to design the at a high level they proposed the build a greenhouse that uses a physical volume similar in shape proposed human habitats from popular renders by spacex nasa eg this a focus on manual tending of the plants rather than systems providing therapeutic benefits for the cafe culture thinking of the greenhouse as a place of read a book

only shows part of the story and missed blood sweat and tears behind the scenes i spent the weekend around and talking to the teams so here are some additional and thoughts which you may find the team had a fairly broad and flexible brief with quite a bit engineering and technical requirements but unfortunately specific team members with these skills as a result they much more of a approach to the challenge as opposed say optimising oxygen the team split into two one with a presentation and the other greenhouse design their early focus on presentation is obvious when you compare the final from the however they spent almost the first hours brainstorming various ideas and design elements but had difficulty settling on final once given some external support and a possible framework to the practicality of their ideas against they quickly through and sketched out a final design allowing the d to begin and concrete work on the this delay in deciding on the design however meant of the extra detail and unique design elements were glossed over or missed in the presentation and in my this ultimately cost them in the the d model and animation was great but they needed a more time being able to show the greenhouse layout in each of various states with exploded would have really they also had done a brief skype and google hangout with challenge organiser who had emphasised the importance of a of the of the greenhouse but unfortunately communicate this to the judges this combined with absence of more examples of subsystem detail ultimately cost here are a few of the features they came up with but convey in the the ability for astronauts to come in and service plants adjust the height to suit different astronauts could effectively have their own rack of plants their own and the sense of ownership and pride goes along with the configuration was quite efficient allowed for a lot of additional storage seeds would be sitting ready and inactive in their growth medium their racks tightly stacked in the of greenhouse leaving lots of space below for priming such as water seeds gasses and potentially storage other base some good work was put into thinking how habitat would occur such as using the lower pressure outside transfer internally stored water into expandable bags on outer any necessary machinery gas storage etc could be in a low cabinet that could double as a couch and workbench giving somewhere the astronauts could sit and relax sitting on with their plants lowered down nearby bring book and take some time potential use of the expanded greenhouse

thoughts which you may find the team benefited greatly from the fact that their challenge was more defined brief which allowed them to hit the ground right away other teams really start until with all software projects though sometimes the things like a typo or misunderstanding on how to use a library api that can slow you down and so they still had their share of problems to eleanor during said that they had various things going but pretty sure she meant by the end of saturday as opposed to them having done full preparatory work from to the team myself i think the focus was on setting the server and doing the necessary google work get the framework functional nevertheless certainly had done more preparation and planning than the three however i do wish put a bit more thought into such

team space deployable greenhouse team captain for the record team zen while cliched it has to be said that everyone was a winner on the everyone had to come together and try to produce not only a but a presentation and overall solution that tried to meet the criteria in only hours and try to find time to sleep and what surprised me and delights me is that most of these teams not who signed up for this challenge but rather general students who heard about this challenge and thought sounds cool to try so when many arrived on saturday morning thought design a space greenhouse or how would a d printer useful in space they really were starting from scratch and to quickly learn things like d printing work in and what is the air pressure on mars as an observer seen behind the curtain a bit i can see that of the teams struggled to achieve everything they had planned the timeframe and some of this extra polish and detail was left in their labs and there are so many wacky and amazing ideas that tossed onto the cutting room floor because it seemed impractical the time or they sure was scientifically viable and had no to find but ultimately this is a hackathon and i think will delighted with the outcomes s of people around the world have introduced to the amazing world of space science and engineering and whole host of amazing ideas generated from this diverse community big congratulations to the challenge organisers both and you next i sure hope so i can tell you this was an amazing event and i to see you here next year kiwispace will be doing its best to it and

worked quite late into the night yesterday sleeping bags were scattered to the side of work areas whiteboards or sketchpads filled with doodles and caffeine in high demand as teams were for the new the final product for teams working on the more conceptual projects today was day the moment to narrow their project scope to what was within the remaining time complete the functional and to start work on the equally important deliverables presentation and any material for judging others had more defined projects such as spot the station their challenge was to identify what functionality in their they could perfect before the deadline and what had to face the these can be tough decisions when doing things as a hackathon and trying to squeeze every brilliant idea into your i had a great day spending some time with each of the teams their pitches and their dilemmas the d printing had the first parts of their final objects churning out slowly on printer see d printing video if you previously seen in the staff were popping in and making sure everyone their presentations underway and they were considering the criteria for product is great but not awesome if collaboration is highlighted sergei gulyaev over i left once again after a hearty pizza dinner where undoubtedly teams will be burning the midnight oil as they rush to as previously mentioned judging occurs on monday at am hope hope they get some sleep and are ready to deliver their with passion and vigour judges for the event us ambassador david ceo of new zealand ict group candace microsoft new zealand tertiary education sector manager recommended judging criteria from nasa no somewhat impact how much impact quality and quantity can this have does this solution solve a big problem or a little creativity how creative is the approach is the solution new something that been attempted before is it something being addressed by the complexity how much progress did they make during the event they start from scratch or build on an existing collaboration are there multiple members of the team did the work with others either virtual participants or other to help develop a broader product how well does this project fit the needs of the they chose to tackle how user friendly is the technology is it complete solution or do they have a long way to sustainability how good is their plan for next steps how are they to continue their work beyond the presentation how well did the team communicate are they in telling the story of the project and why it is important well did they respond to questions from the this criteria shows how much they really have to do to score well only best of luck to the teams i was delighted to find out after my blog post yesterday that are others working on the space apps

progress of the other participants too at user icon markmackay international space apps challenge mark mackay posted on apr i quite sure what to expect when i showed up at aut in auckland today read about the nasa space apps challenge in news last year and browsed the website many times over the past weeks in my attempts to learn more and perhaps get involved it hard to a of what it exactly was and how i could out for anyone else in the same position my account of challenge so this is the first year that the international space apps the challenge abbreviate going forward has been held auckland jointly sponsored by the us embassy and aut and held at campus in it has been primarily promoted at the university so there was dominance of students arriving to participate but a few others also in attendance including one man who travelled up from a total of around people were taking part in the challenge university liaison from the us consulate and sergei institute of radio astronomy and space research opened forum with some introductions and background and the below from the iframe httpaddr there are challenges broadly defined by the international community predominantly esa and nasa i believe covering a range topics participants then work to try to come up with the most and innovative solution in a total of hours a emphasis as the challenge has been modelled on software but a few more physical and conceptual options to tackle the in auckland teams formed around four spot the d printing comparing earth deployable you can either participate virtually from your or teams then broke out to separate work areas around campus as their project for most teams this was the first real chance had to sit and start to plan out what they were doing and given the deadline this was no small feat some of the project briefs are which allows the teams to play to their strengths but also overwhelm by pm on the first night that aspect of the was quite apparent the the team was already through the first functional prototypes of their app while at two of the others were still finalising some aspects of their briefs left just as dinner arrived good pizza but i suspect there be some tough decisions being made this evening to lock in the a key component of the challenge is to get people and teams to together to solve these large problems and have tried facilitate this through a number of online tools global a kind of virtual to help virtual participants join in let a team find a much needed skill etc the person who wrote project brief is also available to answer questions due to new zealand was one of the first to start the challenge and great to be the leading the way it did give us a slight as we had to wait several hours for other sites to come online start wait in addition to having to solve their grand challenge in days also have to create a way to communicate what doing and a for the formal review on monday morning i there will be very little sleep this weekend judges for the event us ambassador david ceo of new zealand ict group candace microsoft new zealand tertiary education sector manager quite impressed with the teams so far i can see thinking quite heavily about the communication aspect of challenges and i hope to see some impressive presentations on a there are some local and global prizes but from talking to the i genuinely get the sense everyone involved is just in it for challenge the thrill and where a global project like the apps challenge is a fantastic idea according to the website people are sitting down and pooling their collective knowledge things and this community spirit which is fantastic to i know looking forward to seeing what comes from the spot station project for one there are plenty of tools out there that to do this but for me as a regular user never seem to work see what great solutions teams from different come up i think tomorrow will be a wonderful day there as a little deprivation sets in sugary drinks are consumed and the hard really happens try to keep you posted with some more photos updates during the day also be present for the presentations on mark user icon markmackay australian space

its the policy is guided by and builds detail into seven principles were released last focus on space applications of national assure access to space strengthen and increase international contribute to a stable space improve domestic support innovation science and skills enhance and protect national security and economic a lot of debate from the space enthusiast community australia that pandered to politicians and were scared calling it a true space personally i this policy sounds expensive in the public mindset almost everyone would agree that we should invest in satellites note that there is no space agency mentioned the document and no australian astronauts planned this is squarely set on economic benefits and future industry niches that be a lot of detail i found yet like what money will flowing to support the policy over the past years there was space research created allocating towards various academic education and industry activities i saw an update late last year and while many of attendees yawned at the presentation for good reason based on some the styles the update for me was quite refreshing and did like the stocktake made by dr andrew parfitt it showed how number of international collaborations have been programmes advanced university programmes seeded etc good value a relatively small investment in my opinion but that money is about run out and the big question is what will happen it looks like space policy unit will continue so must be some funding allocated or at least partitioned within parent so have a read of the policy and let me know what you did they go in the right human spaceflight is off the agenda should it and importantly do you think this could be a good blueprint the new zealand government to download satellite utilisation policy

its annual energy innovation summit in the department advanced research projects announced funding for a new program aimed at rethinking vehicle ev batteries the program robust affordable next energy storage systems or range was created as part of an effort to accelerate electric vehicle innovation to reduce costs improve performance of evs last week announced the names descriptions of the recipients for the range program fresh approaches to making evs available to has invested in transportation technologies since its the new range program complements the beest program doubling the energy density of ev batteries by altering composition and materials amped for seeking advanced power technologies for storage and grids for developing cheap utility storage the range program is a genuine reflection of these programs as it supports truly innovations revolutionary energy the program recognizes that significant breakthroughs in chemistry and vehicle architecture are crucial for evs to compete internal combustion vehicles in response most of the range consider alternative materials for batteries that are lighter existing batteries safer in the case of collision and rely rare materials we spoke with dr cheryl martin director of about the new program which she described as twist on improving the ev battery why ev battery and vehicle design the battery system is the most complex and expensive element of an which means innovations in its size material structure and are integral to making evs affordable and reliable enough for american to replace their conventional combustion the range program facilitates what dr martin calls these kinds of swing innovations by investing in a variety of projects that key system challenges but approach solving these problems different directions the program invests in seedling projects like the collaborative project between enzinc inc and us naval research lab funded at only according to president and michael burz what we knew was needed is systems approach to battery design a reimagining of the architecture of the battery where most battery development uses materials in a fundamentally conventional way we are conventional materials in an exotic architecture battery has the potential to double range and cut costs in half according to dr martin could prompt a technology leap that could absolutely important for the future of on the other end of the spectrum four of the funded projects in range program focus on integrating ev batteries into the structure itself which could reduce vehicle weight increase range and strengthen safety standards one such project run by uc diego funded at million is developing ev batteries as part the support structure which will be incorporated into redesign of the standard vehicle frame the principle investigator the project professor yu qiao commented according to our if batteries can be robust multifunctional with the vehicle structure redesigned drive range be increased to miles at an affordable price the work focuses on creating batteries that can continue to operate and efficiently under adverse conditions in addition to improving cost and dr martin noted that these formable batteries can potentially placed in many different spaces in the car or distributed the frame which would allow ev batteries to operate not as a technical system from the rest of the vehicle but as a single multifunctional technology as limited driving range continues to be significant strike against existing evs these transformative that rethink vehicle architecture to decrease vehicle weight increase range could be adopted by industry in the alumni entrepreneur spotlight events global news partners sponsors the cleantech open november ecofactor raises million of

design processes and effective sharing of data knowledge tools and rapid innovation computational modelling and detailed distributed access to supercomputing an app idea that fit these no problem just pick the area that best describes the public you want to create open to all ideas as long as they public benefit in some is the geni fig geni diagram explaining how geni provides their network either by contact to one of their racks or point to point via their backbone commodity to one of the most advanced networks on the the global environment for network innovation is a national research project its goal provide a testbed for exploring the networks of the geni connects campuses and advanced infrastructure across the allowing next generation applications like yours to be tested and demonstrated in short a pretty fun place for innovators to successful mozilla ignite participants will get access to geni develop and test their cool about speed and low latency enough for streams of uncompressed programmability networks eg with dramatically improved control over network routing experimentation remotely discover configure program debug operate manage and distributed systems across the geni suite match slices to application requirements and distribute programmable throughout the integrated wireless networks for sensor networks and remote and much technologies should i the network you can prototype your app however like but we recommend using fast programmable sliceable network geni will provide plenty of flexibility and opportunities to test gigabit app both in the lab and in the you can build the old fashioned way using and a model or you can experiment with custom protocols routing or other future networking the client free to use any technologies you want but we ask that favour open source and open standards and we strongly no flash or ios where possible your apps should run in a browser we encourage you explore edge web technologies like html webrtc webgl websockets and do you mean by we mean apps and services in the broadest possible sense looking for applications and services that show off networks like geni can do that other networks internet is vision for when most people say app referring to a binary that runs on a specific hardware platform colloquially android app or an iphone app by contrast mozilla has a vision apps that run in any context we call it the runtime and it includes things like html webgl webcl and technologies that bring the web to parity with native we want to establish the open web as a viable common platform and help overcome the proprietary technologies and gardens that characterize most app does that have to do with this while encouraging the use of these edge web technologies not insisting on them their use is encouraged but not this is partly because much of the innovation seeking work in a browser difficult to do zero latency d for instance because browsers yet have the right apis and optimizations for this and many of these apps yet outside of the laboratory not just about speed also network so please consider how your idea can help push the web forward as app development platform but feel restricted by it web as we believe that our connected future requires a common implementable development platform mozilla the web is that platform as the role of the browser changes and distinction between local and remote code begins to blur we the open web will continue to provide the best and most platform to build the apps of the asked what is us us ignite is working to create a national network of with broadband services its goal is to foster creation of novel applications and digital experiences that the potential to transform national priority areas like education and training public safety energy and manufacturing read more at the us ignite where are the official you can check out the official rules right why are you running three rounds of rather than a approach the mozilla ignite challenge uses an iterative funding process over three the challenge jury will meet and award teams for the progress promise they show this way teams with crazy ambitious ideas compete with smaller do i get to keep my intellectual absolutely our hope is that many of the apps developed in challenge will become commercially viable and we want to entrepreneurial innovation at the edges of the network you develop in this challenge is yours to go monetize or at the same time building an open development community geni the open web and other open technologies is another objective of the challenge so we strongly urge all competing to publish some or all of their code under a suitably open the judges may weigh an contribution to open source in prize deliberations check the complete official rules who should web developers university researchers network civic innovators and anyone interested in networks participation is open to however as this is a initiative by the government each team must designate a fiscal agent who will awards on the behalf only and citizens or those legally allowed to work or compensation in the united states can accept awards see contest rules for more details practically this means teams can have members from all over the must also at least one team member or a host in the united how much funding am i eligible to the awards recognize your progress and achievements and are to provide a launching pad for your work the amount of available will increase in each of the three development the first round will be awarding in awards to teams judges see fit the second round will award and the round will award why is mozilla doing mozilla is a global with a mission is to shape future of internet as a public offering transparency and control to developers and users by working researchers developers civic planners and businesspeople we drive innovation that benefits people in their everyday build a better web and keep the internet national

available tackle needs contact for more increasing adherence to tuberculosis drugs in rural developing contexts adherence to medication regimens or the extent to patients take the drugs they are prescribed is estimated at only worldwide this surprisingly common problem is the cause of individual treatment failure and public health problems across a range of diseases and countries the focus of this innovation challenge is on tuberculosis tb kills an estimated million people every year yet the vast majority of cases are adherence to tb drugs is low and is a major driver of the epidemic most successful program geared to increase tb drug adherence observed therapy dots is relatively expensive and was available only to approximately of people with background the yunus innovation challenge ideas award for will given to the team that creates a system that solves as many of problems as possible that cause to tb drugs in developing country contexts for the smallest cost possible the considered may include but should not necessarily be limited to listed below the system may involve a physical device but this is required in judging between proposals credit will be given feasibility acceptability within the community ie likelihood adoption and supporting rationale for how it will address the of adherence for example the rationale could include reasoning on the team decided to focus particular attention on solving one of four issues if a team decides that is actually due some other factor supporting evidence should be given because challenge is to improve adherence where dots is not being due to cost systems should aim to come in at a significantly cost than dots in their entirety including all costs of administration and any manufacturing costs even below this cost will continue to be an important criteria in judging ie cheaper the better the system should be designed to operate conditions prevalent in rural communities in poor countries as present a major challenge for dots participants are encouraged to on a design with a specific community or region in mind as this can helpful in identifying constraints and providing context contextual issue that contestants should keep in mind is that personnel have very high rates of absence in rural and often settings across the developing world this is not just a problem medical service providers systems that require regular attendance individuals that are not accompanied by good monitoring processes fail in this context key considerations factors causing low to tb drugs include forgetfulness procrastination of drugs alleviation of symptoms before the end of prescribed course treatment the drug adherence needs of the poor are wide and varied it is not expected that proposed solutions will address all surrounding adherence to tb drugs however yunus innovation solutions should address a particular need and fill it participants are encouraged to work on a design with a community or region in mind as this can be helpful in constraints and providing context subject reading there are sources of information see bottom of page but in participants are encouraged to read the following works the burden of tuberculosis tuberculosisis the cause of by infectious disease in the world behind only each year estimated million people die of tb like and malaria is also a disease of the poor of people afflicted with tb of the people who die from tb are found in developing and patients with tb in developed countries are poor the majority of tb sufferers are between the ages of and years of age resulting in large economic costs in lost from tb mortality and morbidity preliminary readings include health organization tb publications broekmans j caines k paluzzi je investing in strategies to reverse the incidence of tb london earthscan gandy m and zumla a the return of the white plague global poverty and the tuberculosis london verso drug adherence poor drug adherence been documented across widely varying drug regimens diseases cultural contexts experts have suggested that adherence rates all contexts are approximately and that high adherence to regimens in any context is relatively rare although recognized as significant barrier to public health there is a lack of consensus effective approaches to solving the adherence problem readings include vermeire e hearnshaw van royen p and j patient adherence to treatment three decades of research comprehensive journal of clinical pharmacy and haynes rb mcdonald h garg ax and montague interventions for helping patients to follow prescriptions the cochrane database of systematic reviews article number doi hp garg ax and haynes rb interventions to patient compliance to medication prescriptions journal of american medical association tb and drug resistance adherence to tb drugs is a significant cause of the development resistant strains of tb resistant strains of tb are resistant to tb drugs and strains of tb are resistant to both first and drugs approximately new cases of are identified year and alarming rates of have recently been treatment of is much more expensive than treatment and is particularly alarming because of the lack treatment options for patients infected preliminary readings annals of the new york academy of sciences special issue resistant tuberculosis from molecules to vol b pp paramasivan cn and venkataraman drug resistance in tuberculosis in india indian journal medical research the dots strategy as a response to adherence problems the world health organization who recommends the directly observed therapy dots part of this strategy is the direct observation of patients their medication by a health worker dots has proven to be successful in some contexts such as rapid dots rollout in s however partly because of the relatively high cost of program in dots only covered an estimated of reported cases scaling up of dots has a central role in the plan combat tb to meet targets set by millenium development goals by but many people infected with tb will not have access to a dots for years to come preliminary readings include world organization publications on dots strategy volmink j matchaba and garner p dots and treatment lancet khatri gr and frieden tr rapid dots in india bulletin of the world health organization procrastination and adherence research in economics has suggested people may procrastinate because of a tendency to devalue the relative to the present such procrastination may be an explanation a not taking his or her pills each day or not going to clinic to refill a prescription there may be ways to procrastination for example small financial incentives have shown to increase the percentage of people who pick up their from hiv tests in malawi and a simple planning intervention has shown to cause a large increase the number of college students who up for tetanus shots preliminary readings include laibson d golden eggs and hyperbolic discounting quarterly journal economics thornton r the demand and impact of hiv status evidence from a field leventhal hr r and s jones effects of fear and specificity recommendation upon attitudes and behaviour journal of and social psychology low attendance of health professionals low attendance of health care professionals at clinics developing countries has been widely documented this low may affect patient adherence directly for example a patient may unable to get a refill of tb medication if a health care provider unavailable moreover low attendance of health care providers is important factor to consider in any intervention that deals medication adherence preliminary readings include banerjee a duflo e addressing duflo e and hanna r works getting teachers to come to chaudhury n hammer kremer m muralidharan k and rogers fh missing in teacher and health worker absence in developing criteria the yunus innovation challenge ideas award for will given to participants who create an innovative solution that solves many of the problems as possible surrounding to tb for those living in poverty as the challenge focuses on to tb drugs among the poorest populations solutions should for a price point that makes intervention accessible to communities who are located for the most part in with poor infrastructure and allows for dissemination on a scale as with all ideas awards innovation feasibility and will be important criteria in judging specific issues to include but should not necessarily be limited to acceptability within the community ie likelihood of health impact environmental impact scalabity credit will be given supporting rationale regarding how the solution will directly the issues faced for example this rationale could include why team decided to focus particular attention on solving one aspect of challenge however if a team decides that another factor is significant supporting evidence for this factor also should provided while not required the solution may involve a device the system should be designed to operate in prevalent in poor households and communities where basic hygiene limited again participants are encouraged to work on a design with specific community or region in mind as this can be helpful identifying constraints and providing context resources a sampling resources for participants about adherence to tuberculosis follows there are many more available so please do not hesitate ask other resources yunus centre abdul latif jameel poverty lab for assistance in finding additional resources specific to
