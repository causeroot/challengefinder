native to steppes south of the range of the woolly rhinoceros of ice europe elasmotherium looked little like a horse but it had a single horn in its forehead it became extinct about the same time the rest of the glacial age however according to the nordisk familjebok nordic and science writer willy ley the animal may have survived enough to be remembered in the legends of the native european as a huge black bull with a single horn in the in support of this claim it has been noted that the th traveller marco polo claimed to have seen a unicorn in but his description makes it clear to the modern

complete story of unicorns through the the mystery of unicorn unicorn and womangif the unicorn is one of the most mysterious of all animals it has glorified in folk tales songs poems and stories for centuries it remains one of the great unsolved mysteries of the world the widely held belief in its existence it has not been seen centuries and the popular eastern image from chinese folklore is different from the familiar western image of a white creature the only consistent fact is that a unicorn has a single in the middle of its for true believers the fact that it no longer exists only adds to mystique placing it in the same realm as the dinosaurs the and possibly such unknown creatures as bigfoot and the loch monster others believe the unicorn still exists in remote regions can be discovered only by those of exceptional virtue and in the meantime we can marvel at its beauty and pay tribute to unique place in the culture and history of the the eastern the unicorn has existed in chinese mythology for thousands of years appears in many different forms but the most familiar is a beast the body of a deer the tail of an ox the hooves of a horse and single short horn growing out of the middle of its forehead the on its back is to represent the five sacred colors red yellow blue white and black the hair on its belly yellow in some accounts it has green scales like a the chinese unicorn is known as kilin pronounced which is combination of both ki the male unicorn and lin the female it is careful not to tread on even the tiniest living thing and eat only plant life that is no longer living it lives for the kilin is said to spring from the earth and is revered as one of four superior animals of good omen together with the phoenix dragon and the tortoise that foretell future events and represent basic elements of the first in chinese mythology the unicorn was an animal of good omen that to humans only on important missions its appearance was interpreted a sign of good times and the fact that it has not been seen in centuries suggests that we are living in bad times it will once again when the time is right and when goodness one of the first unicorns is said to have appeared almost ago to give emperor fu hsi the secrets of written language almost years ago in bc another unicorn made an in the garden of the yellow emperor huang this auspicious was seen by the emperor as a sign that his reign would be long peaceful two unicorns also lived during the reign of emperor yao fourth of the five emperors who shaped the world years birth and death of confucius foretold by the chinese also believed that the unicorn could foretell the birth great men like the philosopher confucius in bc pregnant mother met a unicorn in the woods it gave her a small of jade and placed its head in her lap she realized the importance the event and knew it was a good omen from the an inscription on the piece of jade told of the great wisdom her would possess and sure enough confucius became the most respected all chinese philosophers even today years later his words are still honored and revered in his old age reportedly saw the unicorn for himself and knew that it meant he soon other eastern in addition to china other asian countries also have traditions in japan it is known as kirin and has a shaggy mane the body of a bull unlike the chinese unicorn it was a beast to feared especially by criminals in fact it was able to detect and judges were known to call upon the unicorn to determine the parties in legal disputes after fixing its eerie stare on the party it would then pierce him through the heart with its an arabian unicorn known as karkadann was supposedly endowed magical qualities its horn was a charm against the and eating its meat got rid of demons based on the description ancient texts experts now believe that the karkadann was actually oryx a large antelope that appears to have only one horn when from the famous unicorn person associated with the place of approximate adam garden of eden beginning of emperor fu hsi china years emperor huang di garden in china emperor yao china about confucius china ctesias india th century alexander the great asia rd century julius caesar germany i st century prester john asia mid i i genghis khan india early the western unicorn alicorngif perhaps the earliest mention of the unicorn is by herodotus who in rd century bc wrote of the of africa by the th bc the unicorn had become a very popular animal in the world another early surviving mention of the unicorn comes from century later in the writings of the greek historian and ctesias who traveled to persia and brought back fantastic stories merchants who passed through india although he did not see one himself he describes a creature he calls the ass of being equal in size to a horse with a white body a red head eyes and a straight horn on the forehead a cubit long he the lower part of the horn as being white the middle black and tip red as a physician he was especially interested in the which he heard was protection against deadly poisons drinking made from the horn were believed to possess the power of poison when poured into them ctesias represents the unicorn as extraordinarily swift of foot untamable and almost impossible soon after stories became known the famous greek aristotle deduced that the unicorn was probably a real animal but did not believe the stories of magical powers attributed to the the respected historian pliny the elder who was born early in reign of tiberius and died in ad described the unicorn in cyclopaedia historia came to the conclusion that unicorn existed in india unicorn is a ferocious beast with body of a horse the head of a deer the feet of an elephant the of a wild boar and a single black horn two cubits long standing of its forehead both men reasoned that the accounts were and that the animal could exist in fact there was no more reason doubt the existence of a unicorn than that of an elephant or just because they had never personally seen one did not mean it did other early unicorn stories involve two of the greatest leaders ancient times in the rd century bc the macedonian alexander the great boasted that in one of his conquests he rode unicorn into battle in the century before the birth of christ emperor julius caesar reported seeing a unicorn in the deep forests southwestern a few years before the birth of christ a apollonius of tyana claimed to have seen a unicorn in india it was not until a few centuries later that the unicorn really part of the western culture mainly because of its associations the bible and with how to catch a during the middle ages a fable was told that although the unicorn impossible to hunt down it was so impressed by the presence of lovely virgin that it would run up to her and submissively lay its in her lap marco editor colonel yule affirms athat the was supposed to be attracted noty by the beauty or chastity by the perfumes of her dress still legends that spread europe stated that it was impossible to catch a unicorn by force only way to capture one was for a maiden to wait alone where were known to be found when he saw the maiden the unicorn would up and lay its head in her lap at which point it could be taken by the hunters hiding unicorn in the the first mention of the constellation monoceros the was by jakob bartsch around the stars of the unicorn described in detail in the catalog of hevelius in milky way runs through the center of this constellation are stars in monoceros that are visible to the naked unicorns in the my horn shall be exalted like the horn of the the book of he hath as it were the strength of a the book of will the unicorn be willing to serve according to the book of genesis god gave adam the task of everything he saw in some translations of the bible the unicorn the first animal named thereby elevating it above all other beasts the universe when adam and eve left paradise the unicorn went them and came to represent purity and chastity thus the purity in the western legends stems from its biblical the bible also offers an explanation about why the unicorn has not seen for so long during the flood that engulfed the world for and nights noah took two of each animal to safety but were not among them a jewish folk tale mentions they were on board but demanded so much space and attention that noah them they either drowned or managed to swim during the flood and survive somewhere in the world or as some believe evolved into in addition there are seven clear references to the unicorn in the testament although there is now doubt about the original that may have erroneously named another animal as a the jewish talmud also makes many similar references to the unicorn jewish folklore it is the fiercest of all animals and is able to an elephant with a single thrust from its throughout history the church has interpreted the unicom in a of different ways in medieval times it became a symbol of himself and its horn was symbolic of the unity of christ and god medieval paintings show the trinity with christ represented by unicom on the other hand the unicom also appears as a symbol of in the book of isaiah overall however the unicom has come to regarded as a pure and virtuous regardless of the place of the unicom in biblical theory it is that there was a strong belief in the existence in times as well as in the following centuries after all it appears often in the old testament that it can hardly be overlooked in christian world the fact that it appears in the bible meant that devout christian could doubt its unicorn saves india from genghis in medieval times asia was a place of great mystery and the of unicorns only made it more wondrous for example prester john over a vast asian empire in the mid and he was reputed to a number of tame unicorns to europeans this was a sign of his and the legend of the unicorn gained a new chapter a century later mongolian warrior genghis khan conquered much of asia to build a empire however the intervention of a unicorn made him abruptly back on the brink of adding india to his as genghis khan and his army prepared to invade for what would have been an easy victory a unicorn approached and knelt before genghis khan was taken aback but realizing this was a sign from not to attack he turned his army away one of the most ruthless fearless warriors in history had been tamed by a simple unicorn india was saved from historically this was the last significant and reliable sighting in the late s though italian trader marco polo famous for his accounts of travel in china and southeast asia he reported seeing a large unicorn almost as big as an elephant detailed description was almost certainly a rhinoceros but retelling of his tales and the illustrations that accompanied usually made the unicorn fit in with the traditional western unicorns in modern the desire to discover a unicorn exists to this day and many have been made in the th century to create unicorns in the dr w franklin dove of maine manipulated a horn buds to make bull with a single horn growing out of the middle of its head this experiment did not offer an explanation about the existence unicorns it did show that it is possible for animals to grow fifty years later the same procedure was used on white goats produce lancelot the living unicorn that became a great at the ringling brothers and barnum bailey circus this resembled the small unicorns often depicted in medieval paintings tapestries these animals were small enough to sit on the laps young the royal since the reign of king robert iii in the late s the unicorn been a part of the official seal of scotland robert iii turned to purity and strength of the unicorn for inspiration in rebuilding nation and the unicorn was soon incorporated into the royal when james vi of scotland became king james i of both england scotland on the death of elizabeth i in he drew up a new arms that included both the traditional english lion as as the scottish according to folklore however the lion and the unicorn hate other a tradition going back to the ancient babylonians in the fight between the two results from the unicorn representing and the lion representing summer each year the two fight supremacy and each year the lion eventually in the case of scotland and england the fight continued and a english nursery rhyme of the period sums up the animosity it recalls old wars between england and scotland that england the lion and the were fighting for the the lion beat the all round about the the lion and the unicorn remain a part of the british this day supporting the royal shield the canadian modeled on the british version so it also features a lion and unicorn supporting a central the power of the because of the purity its horn known as alicom considered magical and became a popular ingredient in medicines its mere presence was considered a strong protection poison in food and when worn in jewelry it protected the wearer alicorn was often worth more than its weight in gold so emperors and popes were among the few people able to pay the prices demanded they were eager to acquire the precious horn guarantee long and healthy lives with such a lucrative trade alicorn was rampant made from bull horn goat horn or in some from the horns of exotic animals or from ordinary dog complete unicom horns were very rare for example a complete horn owned by queen elizabeth i of england was valued at the time the equivalent of about ounces of gold and enough to buy a large country estate complete with a castle rather coming from unicorns these complete horns often turned out to be long spirally twisted tusks of the male narwhal a large marine kings often placed alicorn on the table to protect themselves poisonous food and drink and until the revolution toppled the in the eating utensils used by french kings were made of horn to counteract any poison in the how to test real unicorn medieval pharmacists believed in the power of the unicorn as medicine and the unicorn even became the according to st hildegard who passionately believed in the power the unicorn to heal illness the strength came from the that once a year it returned to drink the waters and eat vegetation of ground unicorn horn was said to cure fever plague epilepsy gout and a host of other ailments unicorn liver was a cure leprosy shoes made of unicorn leather assured healthy feet and and a belt of unicorn leather worn around the body warded off and fever belief in the power of the unicorn was widely held england until the mid i in order to distinguish real alicorn from false alicorn tests were devised

http://www.ladyoftheearth.com/animals/unicorns.txt of the beasts obeyed noah when he admitted them into the ark all unicorn confident of his strength he boasted shall for and fourty nights the rains poured down and the oceans boiled as in a all the heights were flooded the birds of the air clung onto the ark the ark pitched they were all engulfed but the unicorn kept on however the birds emerged again they perched on his horn and he and why there are no more unicorns from a ukranian folk the unicorn has been a topic of wonder and speculation for centuries of such men as aristotle genghis khan saint thomas and saint the fact that these men considered the unicorn as a very real seventh defines a unicorn as mythical animal generally the body and head of a horse hind legs of a stag tail of a lion and horn in the middle of its the word comes from meaning one and meaning the unicorn has been depicted in the folklore and legends of other ours the chinese believed that they had the body of a deer hooves and an tail where in the west the horn was made of oriental horn was made of flesh the coat of the unicorn was five sacred colors of the chinese red yellow blue white and the chinese called the unicorn to them it was a symbol around bc the emperor fu hsi wrote of seeing a he on the coat of the animal and and perceived those symbols as a thus giving credit to the for the establishment of the the sighting of a was a considered a good omen and often birth of a good ruler other times it appeared to give a warning to scouting party for genghis khan reported seeing a a type of that warned the party to stop the war and that will upon receiving the report the mongol stopped his unicorns were reported in india as well the greek ctesias wrote of seeing there which was as large as a horse he said that the horn of was about a foot and a half long and three colored with the base the middle black and the top the best known legends surrounding the unicorn are in western culture view of the unicorn as a horse with a horn is popular and has in our heritage for thousands of years the unicorn is mentioned bible in several verses the palm sunday tract in the roman catholic me from the mouth and my lowliness from the horns saint ambrose the bishop of milan in the fourth century unicorn a symbol of christ as he wrote then has one horn unless it only begotten son the unique word of god which has been next to god very saint augustine considered the horn of the unicorn to be of the unity of the faith of the the horn of the unicorn has been sought after for centuries in the west thought to have magical properties and could purify poisons therefore a very valuable commodity to have pope paul iii is said to have pieces of gold for one but james i of england got a much better deal only paying pounds sterling for one the horn of the narwhal was substitute for that of the unicorn for those unscrupulous because of that problem a common test to determine the validity of a was to use its magical properties of purification david de pomis is very little of the true horn to be found most of that which is such being either horn or tusk a true test by which know the genuine horn from the false place the horn in a vessel of of material you like and with it three or four large and live the vessel covered if you find four hours later that the scorpions or almost lifeless the horn is a good one and there is not enough the world to pay for the search for the unicorn and proof of its existance dates back almost as the legends which surround it ctesias spoke of the unicorn in the darius ii the king of persia in bc chinese writings date back to the men of the ancient world believed in the existance of the unicorn object of their searching was to find it not to prove it existed until later in history that man began to doubt the in the ninth century margoulies wrote is universally held unicorn is a supernatural being and of auspicious omen so say the odes the biographies of worthies and other texts whose authority even village women and children know the unicorn is a but this animal does not figure among the barnyard animals it is easy to come across it does not lend itself to nor is it like the horse or bull the wolf or deer in we may be face to face with a unicorn and not know for sure are we know a certain animal with a mane is a horse and that a with horns is a bull we do not know what the unicorn looks even though the existance of the unicorn is questionable its symbolism the beast like all mythological creatures has been a reflection of and fears dreams and nightmares and inner consciousness mythological beasts as representations of fears specifically jung thought that the purity of the unicorn was importance most mythological creatures represent worst are usually more evil than animals or man they kill for pleasure and involved in unspeakable atrocities the unicorn is an exception to being a symbol of purity hope love and the decline of the unicorn began with the renaissance and the advent thought the beliefs that had held for thousands of years began when man could not prove the existance of the unicorn after report of a unicorn was attributed to a more believable a more mundane animal rhinos goats and horses were all of unicorns as technology advanced more exact tests and were developed which added to the mounting evidence against finally the unicorn was added to the list of animals regarded and would later only be found in stories and what of the unicorn today the unicorn is returning if only is that symbolism that people are seeking today the idea of natural and love that much of society has lost in the shadow of shepard wrote is not that the men of the middle ages who believed were less intellegent than we their intellegence was turned in direction we wrong ourselves when we insist that if they good their flesh and blood actuality on our level we will have none to find the unicorn as the ancients did we have to unlearn what learned we must go back to an earlier way of looking at the world will we find the now we have seen each said the unicorn believe believe in you is that a

of familiar animals such as peacocks lambs lions bullocks donkeys horses dogs eagles and calves job job god reminded job of the characteristics of a variety impressive animals he had created showing job that god was far man in power and job had to be familiar with the animals on list for illustration to be effective god points out in job the unicorn whose strength is great is useless for work refusing to serve man or harrow plow the valley this aid gave job a glimpse of greatness an imaginary fantasy would have defeated the purpose of modern readers have trouble with the unicorns because we that a feature is not uncommon on menu for design consider the rhinoceros and narwhal the bible unicorns skipping like calves psalm traveling bullocks and bleeding when they die isaiah the presence a very strong horn on this powerful creature intended to make readers think of the absence of a unicorn in the modern world should not cause us doubt its past existence think of the dodo bird it does not today but we do not doubt that it existed in the century reports from southern africa described rock drawings eyewitness accounts of fierce animals such report describes a single horn directly in front about as as arm and at the base about as thick it had a point it was not attached to the bone of the forehead but fixed in the the elasmotherium an extinct giant rhinoceros provides possibility for the identity the skull has a huge bony protuberance on the frontal consistent with the support structure for a massive horn fact archaeologist austen henry layard in his book nineveh its remains sketched a creature from an obelisk company with bovine animals he identified the animal as an indian rhinoceros the biblical unicorn could been the assyrian archaeology provides one other possible solution to unicorn identity crisis the biblical unicorn could have been aurochs a kind of wild ox known to the assyrians as horns were very symmetrical and often appeared as one profile as can be seen on ashurnasirpal palace relief stone prism fighting rimu was a popular sport assyrian kings on a broken obelisk for instance boasted of slaying them in the lebanon extinct since about aurochs bos primigenius were huge creatures julius caesar described them in his gallic wars a little below the elephant in size and of the appearance and shape of a bull their strength and speed are they spare neither man nor wild beast which they have espied not even when taken very young can they be rendered familiar to and tamed the size shape and appearance of their horns much from the horns of our oxen these they anxiously seek and bind at the tips with silver and use as cups at their sumptuous the highly prized horns would have been a symbol of strength to the ancient bible one scholarly urge to identify the biblical unicorn with the aurochs springs from a similarity between the assyrian word rimu the hebrew word we must be very careful when dealing anglicized transliterated words from languages that do not share english alphabet and phonetic structure however similar in ugaritic and akkadian other languages of the ancient middle as well as aramaic mean wild bull or buffalo and an arabic means white however the linguistics of the text cannot conclusively prove how horns the biblical unicorn had while modern translations translate as wild ox the king james version german bible the septuagint and the latin vulgate this hebrew word with words meaning animal the importance of the biblical unicorn is not so much its as we would like to its reality the bible clearly describing a real animal the unicorn mentioned in the was a powerful animal possessing one or two strong fantasy animal that has been popularized in movies and books it was it is now likely extinct like many other animals to think the biblical unicorn as a fantasy animal is to demean word is true in every help keep these daily articles coming support in addition to job the unicorn is mentioned numbers deuteronomy isaiah in job list of impressive real animals goes on to peacocks ostriches horses hawks and eagles god builds up to crescendo commanding job to look at the behemoth which he created on the same day he created man job description matches that of a sauropod following the behemoth the list concludes with the leviathan powerful fiery sea creature see could behemoth have been dinosaur edward robinson ed dictionary of the holy bible revised edition pages the report in nature described a skull with a frontal protuberance more than three feet in circumference bony protuberance with its associated structures is thought to supported a horn over a yard long norman lockyer elasmotherium nature international weekly journal of august p austen henry layard nineveh and its remains london murray p evidently the kjv translators were aware of this possibility they included a margin note by the unicorns of isaiah or rhinocerots the latin vulgate translates the same hebrew as unicorn in some contexts and rhinoceros in others aurochs is both singular and plural like sheep viewable at httpaddr algernon a visit to bashan and argob london religious tract society p brittanica concise encyclopedia sv aurochs julius caesar gallic wars book chapter httpaddr elizabeth mitchell egyptian chronology prove that bible is unreliable in the new answer book ed ken green forest arkansas master books pp some writers who hold to the identity think that the translators substituted the plural unicorns for the singular unicorn in deuteronomy because they were uncomfortable the idea of a unicorn however the kjv themselves noted the literal translation an unicorn in their margin note they likely chose the plural rendering to fit context of the verse deuteronomy states his glory is like the firstling of his bullock and his horns are the horns of unicorns with them he shall push the people to the ends of the earth and they are the ten thousands ephraim and they are the thousands of manasseh the compares the tribal descendants of horns descendants of his two sons ephraim and manasseh with the horns of unicorns horns is plural because there are two sons view and

reread it a times since j hurst reviewers made a similar this book was great but i feel that when you read a book as as this you want to wait forever for the next one to published httpaddr reviewers made a most helpful customer of people found the following review out of stars not what think october by when i bought this book in third grade i expected a girly story unicorns i only bought it as all my friends did too when i got it read a page got distracted and left it to collect dust for ages i was in seventh grade i finally had the sense to give the book shot i am sooooo glad i did it is not a girly book about unicorns is a well written fantasy with deep characters and an intriguing the story moves at a perfect pace and it is a book i adore i the title is very misleading it is a great story and it is right there with ella enchanted the immortals quartet harry potter forgotten beasts of eld and the changling sea those are books probably also enjoy if you enjoyed comment was this review helpful to of people found the following review out of stars a classic august by j i read this book in the third grade and have reread it a dozen since i love the different creatures the creative stories and possibilities that this first book provides and as it is a book the poor writing must be forgiven a warning though i would recommend this book for a child under the age of or so the scenes are scary for young children and the relationship is rather comment was this review helpful to of people found the following review out of stars an enchanting story august by d since i was young been enchanted by unicorns so of course i to get a copy of into the land of unicorns when i saw it and finishing it i regret the decision one the story opens with a great bit of tension with cara being chased up bell tower by some unknown foe and once at the top follows her instructions thus taking a literal leap faith and finding herself in the world of during her journey through must deliver a message to unicorn is chased and injured by creatures bent on the amulet sworn to protect and at first they succeed but the aid of some new friends cara is able to recover it she then herself in a battle with a dragon and another twist with biological not only is the story itself enchanting balanced with a story such as this especially for young it would be entirely possible to paint it too rosy leaving out all bad things but here the trials cara faces are tastefully done mission is not easy and rarely do magical solutions pop out of though she does receive help from creatures and travelers she along the while reading i ran the gamut of emotions from tension to fear sadness to happiness and i was a bit disheartened when the book i was anxious to see what happened to cara but i guess that means need to grab the second comment was this review helpful to see all customer reviews newest write a customer most recent customer out of stars how this affected my this

into joining one side or another though there are weak selections in this amazingly anthology are several standouts for each side queen of the undead carrie takes readers once again to the world of the forest of hands and delacorte in the commanding bougainvilla though there some graphic language alayna dawn love will tear us takes place in another immensely intense and world diana peterfreund wows readers by delving again into the world of rampant harperteen with the care and feeding of baby killer unicorn proving astrid is not the only strong hunter out there conversely meg cabot provides a funnier view of beasts in princess prettypants in which a unicorn literally rainbows the debate is wrapped up with libba strong tale prom night leaving readers with both hope and realism for

holly holly out of out of see all customer a great short story anthology and all about and unicorns the flashlight reader reviewers made similar very well done lots of fun and a great story eckert reviewers made a similar anyway back to this book there really much i can unless i go into every single story so just trust me when i say this a must read looksielovitz reviewers made a most helpful customer of people found the following review out of stars entertaining but november by kitten kisser review my biggest problem with this audio book collection is that it is for kids ages now i am either getting way too old or our is really slipping these short stories include vulgar language i want to fxxk him a finger right up the ass etc now all of language is fine for adults that i have no issue with if i was purchase this for my year old i would be furious that the contained so much crude vulgarity you have homosexual unicorns having sex with women bad language a lot of sexual now if you are an adult you get a kick out of stories like this by all means this is something worth having if you are getting for your kids then i guess you should use your parental discretion decide what you feel is appropriate for your kids if you have problem with any of the above mentioned then fine for those who now you i gave this stars because there were some pretty entertaining stories in this collection besides i was pretty much hooked at title some were fun silly some were dark but still fun for most part it is nice that unlike some short story collections are just that short stories they are not parts of a much story that might leave you a little in the dark trying to get a on the bottom line entertaining listen for adults worth having if you get a good price on comments was this review helpful to of people found the following review out of stars fun reading and intro to authors by been looking forward to this one for awhile i had read books some of the authors but not all there are a lot of stories in one the running commentary from black larbalestier was funny too think have to give it to team zombie in the end but i did find few unicorn stories that i the highest justice by garth nix read any nix books this one has a unicorn and a zombie so maybe its best that it the collection i liked it not spectacular but still a good love will tear us apart by alaya dawn johnson boy for boy who has his own killer secrets i liked this one it drew me and although the is not a happy one i found myself for purity test by naomi novik loved this one very funny a needs a virgin to help it on its quest to save baby unicorns capable warrior virgins are hard to bougainvillea by carrie ryan set in the world of forest of hands teeth although with different characters i say that i liked main character but she felt very real which was probably unsettling i liked the a thousand flowers by margo lanagan for me the most disturbing what happens after the unicorn and virgin meet up not sure how i about this one the prose was well done but the subject matter if thought about it too much was the children of the revolution by maureen johnson this one was right taking its cues from entertainment gossip a student on vacation from hell finds herself caring for the children of a mysterious celebrity but something quite right with the care and feeding of your baby killer unicorn by diana peterfreund set in the same world as her rampant series this one was good but felt unfinished too inoculata by scott westerfeld i read anything by this but he is going on my tbr list good story about the kids who grow after the zombie apocalypse and what happens when a chance gives them a second chance i look at boredom quite the princess prettypants by meg cabot liz dreams of getting her own for her birthday and ends up with a unicorn then she finds just how handy a unicorn can be fun story especially when she with her ex and the cold hands by cassandra clare this one was ok in a town where dead come back adele and her love are parted by death for a the third virgin by kathleen duey this one was just ok too a unicorn story with a beast addicted to life taking it that prom night by libba bray another good one a mixture of hope moments of happiness in a hopeless comments was this review helpful to of people found the following review out of stars best anthology ever may by in case you were wondering i am team zombie now that out the way i have to say that i really loved all the stories anthology has such a great collection of authors most of the stories was wishing they were their own page book because the stories that now back to why team zombie i am a vampire fan and pretty effing close plus here in minnesota we have this thing the zombie pub crawl where i believe there was over zombies year yeah we minnesotans love our zombies i have gone been a for the crawl twice and i also attended a minor league baseball game a zombie on zombie night so being that i have been undead and brains i can attest to how awesome zombies are so there is no way could be anything but team unicorns are a bit of a rarity i never see them at halloween and only time i ever see them are in those cent sticker machines at that make them less cool though they just the attention they deserve they are elegant mysterious and rainbows and rainbows are bad ass just ask the double rainbow guy even cried at their awesomeness see the youtube video if you know who talking anyway back to this book there really much i can say unless go into every single story so just trust me when i say this is a read comment was this review helpful to see all customer reviews newest write a customer most recent customer out of stars this as interesting as i thought it would be pretty buteh most were definitely listenable but not super read published days ago by out of stars parents this audio book is labeled for grades and up however there is a of vulgarity included that is

insightful december by deena verified when my grandfather died a few months ago he left me his unicorn i remember playing in meadows of sunshine and daises with the when i was a young girl but i never paid attention to anything the business aspect of the most my grandfather ever got to teach me was how to brush not as easy as this book was a life saver i can now say that only weeks after reading this book i have the farm around and am already seeing profits if i keep going at rate i am my projections see me even surpassing my thank you thank you thank you i owe my farm to an absolute must read for anyone even considering a unicorn comment was this review helpful to of people found the following review out of stars seems like a good idea but here are practical pointers april by mr on the surface raising unicorns for your own unicorn farm may like a fascinating and wondrous hobby or business after all get the pulse racing and put a smile on your face more than herd of magnificent white unicorns galloping across a gorgeous meadow however take it from someone who has been there and done raising your own unicorns is much more trouble than its worth when take into account all of the first of all when acquiring your unicorns you have to be very of charlatan unicorn breeders who try to sell you non pure unicorns i tell you how many times one of these yahoos tried sell me bastardized unicorns with satyr and even pegasus blood in heck any nine year old can immediately spot a pegasus bred posing as a unicorn you have to do your homework when assembling reputable line of unicorns for a farm and you would be amazed at amount of mythological chicanry that goes on in the grey by far the biggest problem with having a unicorn farm were the death lawsuits yes we had the romantic notion of opening up unicorn farm to kids who could pet and ride the wondrous beasts what this book tell you is how to stop young kids getting impaled by the unicorn horns even with adult supervision was difficult to stop the magnificent creatures from burying horns deep into the guts of any little kid that would stray or fall the unicorn i can tell you from personal experience that it is not pretty sight seeing an year old girl gored completely through by unicorn horn as the mystical beast trots around the riding followed by a trail of blood and yes more than once even after told children to be careful when petting the unicorn it only takes instant for the animal to bury its razor sharp horn right into cranium of the unsuspecting child and of course there were inevitable taunters kids who would make fun of the creatures only to find themselves ripped open by the horn of agitated after deaths and dozens of life threatening injuries we could not financially make it feasible to run our unicorn farm and it open to the public we calculated that the only way our unicorn to be profitable was to limit deaths by impaling and goring to no than per year tops and given the rate of fatalities we experienced it just was not realistic now you can read this book try it but all i am saying is you better expect to get your mussed a so our unicorn farm experience was not quite the tidy little this book wants to paint there are dozens of bloody crime scene from the major case squad that i could add to this book that would a more balanced perspective to this endeavor and might make you twice about getting into the whole unicorn tried virgins believe me however three of the virgins impregnated which led to a whole new slew of lawsuits its business defending a wrongful impregnation by a unicorn suit insurance cover comments was this review helpful to of people found the following review out of stars brand new unicorn ranch march by f i bought this book as a

zombies lgbt a solid collection of zombie or unicorn themed there was only one story that featured both which let me down little of course when i think about it a bunch of stories that were about zombies fighting unicorns would have gotten old fast but really would have liked to see just one battle just somebody write this for me please i did not like the banter between the two teams it felt like banter which is a solid collection of zombie unicorn themed sadly there was only one story featured both which let me down a little of course when i about it a bunch of stories that only were about zombies unicorns would have gotten old fast but i really would have liked see just one battle just one somebody write this for please i did not like the humorous banter between the two it felt like internet banter which is hilarious when happening but read well when you come back to the thread month later certainly the editors holly black and larbalestier had a good time though and that is nothing to sneeze at go so to the individual the highest justice by garth nix aw garth man you know love you but this story was not a success it displays his good writing but the story go anywhere it felt like beginning of something interesting about the source of power of of justice something that could have developed but it strangled way too short shame really points for being the only story both a zombie and a love will tear us apart by alaya dawn johnson i liked this a good deal a zombie story but with a novel explanation for zombie protagonist who is not a shamber or a groaner but instead emo teenage serial killer with a prion disease god help me a love story one that was surprisingly effective the zombie not really dead though so i have to freak out necrophilia gross the zombie metaphor usually comes down to the whole of death thing but this twisted the drive hunger with desire along with some oedipal fun the romance is two boys and i know something here about coming out passing and all that but i sorted all of that out yet makes the story surprisingly layered for a short story i also enjoyed how the characters talked about music and art not in a way but in the obsessive enthusiasm way that captured something perfect about adolescent courtship rituals yup i am a dork for writing that sentence that purity test by naomi novik urban smartass meets unicorn i know this really work for me but i think really more me than it and the smartassery was pretty solid there something tonally off for me between the hungover runaway teen in a park and the bubbly cheeky froth that was the but i give it tons of points for a solid leia bougainvillea by carrie ryan yeesh very effective beautiful story about the daughter of an island dictator after zombie apocalypse the story ripples with nostalgia which gets throat slit in the final pages tears the hell out of a thousand flowers by margo lanagan now this is the in this collection no contest i expect a unicorn story creep the freaking stuffing out of me but this does i really something different from the a peasant boy finds a noblewoman in the forest you can almost write it from there tender ministrations blooming love whatever no reminded me of one of angela wolf stories the way it plays narrative voice the creation of folklore bestiality a bunch other stuff my word forbidden love never seemed so the children of the revolution by maureen johnson maybe read too many zombie short stories but this hit a lot of marks seen in the zombie dance before but a lot less effectively i like the barely coded references to certain actresses rainbow tribe and her hot actor boyfriend no not josephine felt lazy points for creepy kids though even though creepifying is maybe too easy the care and feeding of your baby unicorn by diana this is another one where my disinterest is probably more personal objective i found myself shimming a lot because there seemed like ton of extraneous information which in a short story seems weird found the concept of the venomous unicorn silly beyond the telling it and i thought the of the religious household and their ideas about the return of venomous unicorns seriously it makes laugh to write that both underdeveloped and inoculata by scott westerfeld hmm liked this but it felt an opening act and i wanted the ideas explored more fully so pretty great as a teaser but fails a bit as a short story certainly not maybe a bs thing to about wanting more but sometimes i think not enough credit is the the form of the short story its conventions and expectations not a short story aficionado or anything but it bugs me when thrust of the story can be spoilered in a short sentence in editorial princess prettypants by meg cabot my affection for this is certainly beyond its literary merit because going to be in minutes and might be overly for some a girl is given unicorn by an aunt who always gets the gifts wrong you know the the one giving you teddy bears in your a unicorn farts rainbows literally but then date rape sexting the boy door super fun to read though and you go cold hands by cassandra clare fail heard tell of cassandra clare from all the flaming and whatnot on goodreads but never read anything by her i think leave at this other than bunch of other niggling nitpicks my biggest problem was where the is this taking place all medieval whatever dukes and hangings but then cds and pop cultural references and is all hey this one sorcerer cursed the town and okay then in england wait just kidding england actually have magic and the monarchy is constitutional these days seriously where and when are we plus everyone sounds like a frustrating lack of coherence one that started me picking threads and then the whole story fell apart the more i think it the more this story fails seriously why they just burn dead curse over and rrrromantic stories with zombies me the third virgin by kathleen duey another metaphor that i not expect to be explored through unicorns this time centering their healing powers but i think this one worked as well for told through the voice of unicorn a voice which is pretty and overly expository and would probably be better served through third person narration good though not prom night by libba bray a really nice sucker punch of ending on this collection the zombie apocalypse takes the first leaving a town of traumatized teens aping adulthood they at jobs take drugs try to reenact the rituals that mark the from one stage of life to another yeah right here it like likes see

excellent phil gigante some of you may be more familiar with as the voice of jericho barrons delivers many an eargasm as master of ceremonies holly and justine larbalestier provide their own rather nice voices back and forth banter at the beginning of each story the cast is pretty decent with the major high point of nick aka todd hewitt and the major low point of ellen grafton janie from my score the the highest justice by garth gruesome undead queen with oozing pus and rotting limbs who wantsa kiss murderous unicorns i forget if this is supposed to be a unicorn story or a zombie i think the author probably had his unpaid intern write this a very boring soporific start to the anthology purity test by naomi a nice play on the mythology a heroine homeless tough and realistic ellen grafton makes her sound like a scrappy twelve year old sounds like something i would write in a bout of silliness in afternoon and a horrible writer forgettable and not very funny princess prettypants by meg a unicorn who farts rainbows but can also turn into a vengeance demon when necessary a cute enjoyable story that is also about as deep as a mud sweet and funny but barely scratches the surface of a premise that actually pretty ripe with darker possibilities cold hands by cassandra even justine larbelestier the head of team zombie keep from using the phrase emo zombies when referring to this story a weird of victorian england and present day america makes no sense zombies that actually all that different from regular people a story about zombie civil rightsin the same way that little mermaid is a movie about human civil rights the bougainvillea by carrie everything up to the ending the ending teen angst prose and in the midst of zombie apocalypsewhich is all mostly redeemed by that ending the children of the revolution by maureen angelina jolie as a crunchy granola immortality seeking weirdo a narrator likeable and amusingly clueless ellen grafton makes her sound like a scrappy twelve year old a genuinely hilarious mockery of celebrities crazy religions and their scores of adopted children prom night by libba teenagers running society and actually bartering a police the promall the important things boy serenades girl and supposed to be sexy romantic this feels more like an introduction to a novel than a short very classic libba bray with a lot of sarcasm and bluster starting to realize that not really a fan inoculata by scott half zombie teenagers inherit the earth lonely snarky independent main character who also happens to be lesbian this one also feels more like an introduction to a series than a story and very classic westerfeld with a foursome of set apart by paranormal abilities and born into a frightening world love for scott westerfeld is pretty much cemented by now so i definitely read a novel featuring these characters the love will tear us apart by alaya dawn person perspective used well zombie romance the fact that i needed to use quotes in the above tally because the gushy i will love you forever type of romance nick podehl has the most wonderful voice in the world a gritty emotional tale that breathes new life into the old i you but i also want to kill you story the third virgin by kathleen a sort of interview with the unicorn creative twist on the unicorn healing mythology nick podehl puts on a very mediocre but adorable welsh accent use of the phrase in a trice a very unique idea that also manages to sound incredibly familiar the care and feeding of your baby killer unicorn by diana venomous unicorns religious and moral questioning a boy named eve diana peterfreund actually seems to know what a short story is this is one of my favorites of the anthology the main incredible growth throughout the story is very moving the ending is nice punch in the gut i be surprised if diana peterfreund an experienced short story author a thousand flowers by margo narration passed effortlessly between three points of view nick podehl puts on vaguely english accent beheadings childbirth suicide and view spoiler why do unicorns like virgins so much oh ooooooh the most genuinely creepy and haunting story of the bunch lanagan somehow wrote a unicorn story that trumps every single story in terms of genuine horror zombies seem downright cuddly perfect musical so see my final score zombies unicorns so that means the

for the win all the way never laugh when i read crack a smile at most but not laugh introduction alone a debate between editors holly black justine larbalestier about the benefits of zombies and had me laughing out loud oh the stories that could fill anthology so who won my heart team zombies or team unicorns the fickle trail of my the highest justice by garth nix the most interesting about this story was the titillation of a zombie appearance it okay had the flair of a medieval unicorn story but without any of mystique of the medieval creatures i think nix should have stuck team zombie and left the description of unicorns to someone who to write about love will tear us apart by alaya dawn johnson the started out crass with way too many f words not a fan of humor or the f word not even a little the zombie pov descriptions of his virus as a psychopathic disorder were awesome the battle of love vs zombie feeding was good too without the cheese but all that crassness made me feel dirty and never recovered from it plus not a fan of romances know zombies are gross but they can be funny or scary without crass factor right maybe i want to be on team purity test by naomi novik score one for humor jokes finding a virgin in nyc harry potter and how dragons are so cooler than unicorns which begs the question dragons or sequel anyone midway through it fizzled and got old but a unicorner who has a sense of humor about unicorns maybe bougainvillea by carrie ryan we already know ryan can write best seller about the zombie apocalypse she surprise us a good unicorn story or even a different zombie story okay the was interesting and memorable beside the tense shifts that drove crazy but zombie apocalypse dictatorship keeping the last humans intact rebellious teenager we read this before a thousand flowers by margo lanagan the pov shifted in middle of the story dropping the only character i connected several vague explanations and descriptions later not a fan of writing we learn that the point of unicorns is not to save wrongly accused to heal the princess child to avenge the robbery her purity but beastiality and a romance that leaves a lot of in its wake including its readers with those graphic images in head not only beastiality but with a child what ever to the magical creatures that were supposed to be the point of anthology are they ever going to make an appearance definitely zombie at this the children of the revolution by maureen johnson a about children cured from death by a zombie tom cruise on his no medication media rant angelina jolie adopting another child celebrities who actually raise their let you decide what johnson is mocking either way the made me smile i knew there was a reason i was team the care and feeding of your baby killer unicorn by peterfreund if i get a magical unicorn the way they are in medieval fiction take a killer version with del vampire del unicorn slayer who just kill them story that tied into the mythology and storyline of her novel more so but since i read it i have the expectation for new creativity i did with ryan a strong story protagonist not discounting team unicorn just inoculata by scott westerfeld i was into this story until just ended a flat empty quitting of words because already on too long westerfeld tried to make a quick enlightening or maybe just make me think about zombies a different way but work for me some action same girl going for some action it is in vogue these days story was just developing when it ended leaving me to wonder if there just any more good zombie stories out there my is in princess prettypants by meg cabot again with the sense humor about unicorns none of team zombie have touched humor johnson with her satire not nearly as strong as this cabot says yeah okay so unicorns are the obnoxious fairytales little girls but if one showed up on your doorstep would you turn it away or sell it on ebay or would use that fierce power to intimidate your oh yeah and happy so bad either mock all you want you know deep down a unicorn score one for team cold hands by cassandra clare not having read the instruments series myself i had heard that writing atrocious but i found her writing in this quite beautiful her the types just undead cursed to return from grave seeking out the company of their loved ones making the story not quite the moral dilemma of story but i still it a sweet zombie love story still open to either the third virgin by kathleen duey i liked the idea of psychopathic del zombie del unicorn story more than i liked delivery of it i find myself wondering if any of team unicorn writers actually like prom night by libba bray a story about zombies on prom i am so there only not what this story was about zombie apocalypse this one where the adults got infected and children survived and as their food and hope runs out they hold not a bad story although bray once again pushes the i know what are like display too far but it quite the story wanted read when i know bray is capable of humor and zombies on prom lend themselves to there was no showdown none of the unicorns showed up and there enough humor in the zombie stories team had a story that left a bad taste in my mouth but there plenty that shined which is rather difficult with a anthology so who won team zombie or team unicorn have to say editors their commentary was

to a mix between old fashioned voodoo zombies new age religion and celebrity culture yeah i know sounds like too much but trust me johnson makes it libba prom night this is the woman who great terrible beauty it surprised me because although i liked liked loved the first gemma doyle book this dark story is not only better written but so much more emotional thought provoking this one will stay with me for a long long not so awesome zombie entries garth the highest justice not really sure whether this team zombie or team unicorn because it has a little of both way i care for alaya dawn love will tear us apart i liked it but twillight the zombie version granted this is written so much than twillight however i help thinking that the novel loves to hate inspired this scott inoculata struck me as an introduction to a story rather than a complete cassandra cold hands even belong here really light for kids kids who are not very discriminating on the unicorn side the case for their dominance and supreme was very nearly won by diana the care and feeding of baby killer unicorn silly title no oh yeah i agree this is first story i read from this collection i know virtually nothing writing although i apparently know lots about reputation so i was more than a little to find out what kind of writer she is this story blew me away for short story there was an amazing amount of depth to it created a complex and believable world in which unicorns scary killer unicorns exist this was also a bit of a coming of age story romance story and a little bit of religion thrown in as well yes know it seems like way too much but it worked i was hooked from moment the young protagonist wen sees a live unicorn at a circus show the unicorn growls handler grabs arm and to her one of us oh gawd i literally got chills at moment and was reminded of the superbly creepy scene from when everyone is chanting gooble gobble one of us one of long story short i think going to have to read some work in the notable unicorn meg princess prettypants had the feel of a silly teen but i loved it anyway just as light and fluffy as the title kathleen the third virgin is dark thought provoking and creepy enough to be a zombie story only there any zombies not so awesome unicorn stories margo a thousand flowers is very typical of lanagan spoiler what the fuck is it with this woman and bestiality spoiler i was disappointed to find this story difficult to get she presented a vague world and multiple points of view i found whole thing to be a bit messy and the story just never got a good naomi purity test just do it for me a little oriented a little snarky somehow this seemed to be like all anthologies this was a mixed bag but the great ones than made up for the stories zombies vs unicorns as so

converting to zombies i blame them team zombie really where scott westerfeld and cassandra stories have something common and that something is also what was discussed in lia guest post last week they both make it clear that zombies are dumb from george slow sluggish mindless the days later or zombieland zombies who are capable of thoughts are fast and yep zombies have evolved they even become boyfriend material although that still raises eyebrows you really think about it the point is zombies are scott and cassandra have both brought up this evolution in stories one considers that zombies are simply bored while the has them living amongst humans like old friends who as my first venture into this book of zombies and unicorns i was satisfied and amused i picked both of these first because i a fondness of their previous work and found myself super curious they would write zombies i found the scott story pretty entertaining i even wished it was it definitely has a intriguing concept as for the cassandra story it was passable felt very weak as far as the zombie i could think quite a few plot holes behind the zombie existence regardless it still light and for more of my

unicorn having said that my favorite unicorn story is the and feeding of your baby killer unicorn by diana zombies vs unicorns has a large mix of diversity in each of the stories which either have a seriousness to them or are humorous meg unicorn story princess prettypants which is the name the rainbow farting unicorn a year old receives for her humor romance gore and adventure mixed together to fuel great debate zombies or unicorns and who would if on team in the middle by the time you finish reading book i feel have picked a side with a great mix of ya find yourself persuaded to be on

but this one blew me some of the stories of course were stronger than others but all them were enjoyable it might be my personal macabre leanings but thought that the zombie tales were particularly strong and tended have a bit more to say about the human condition but how can stories not reflect the human for those who enjoyed tales as well i also recommend warm bodies by isaac like like see

wonder no as this anthology puts that question to rest or slays it with a pointy object depending on your view point then again it may just up a whole pile of gross human remains which only goes to spark debate once zombies although only born in more recent times have a wide appeal but not all zombies are slow mindless creatures although certainly are as some are calculating and resourceful who are able blend in to the world around them for the most part that is if can control their desire for that culinary delicacy that is unicorns have always existed either as symbols of purity and hope or vicious blood thirsty killers but even while ripping your heart these unicorns are still able to fart rainbows and sparkle with their impossible existence is always questioned but their ability charm has never failed well not on anyone still zombies vs unicorns answers the age old question you rather killed by a unicorn or loved by a as surprisingly it is zombie stories that are more to do with love and the unicorn that are more to do with death even though i have long been an of unicorns with their intriguing nature and timelessness i must that zombies are very compelling and haunting

lot of goes on in my head it make any sense even if you think it for a bit but still it exists and pretty awesome to each story was took on the topic of either zombie unicorn in a unique way and managed to keep me reading i loved snippets that prefaced each story with holly and about what good about the unicorn or characters of each story they really brought the whole thing to however my general appreciation for the anthology does not mean all of the stories were perfect little bundles of happy jessica fact i rather disliked a few of the stories that mean in their own special ways of my biggest qualms overall were with the language yeah i get it young adult fiction and teens like being edgy and all that but honestly i think the zombie apocalypse gives you the to use whatever language you want some of the characters and i see on this if okay with an explosion of language from lesser intelligent characters though then chances are you a problem with these i also too fond of the number of stories there were this anthology apparently in this era i beg to other than that though the stories did their duty in entertaining and trying to get me to side one way or the other i was swayed to side but quite a few stories from each did stand out to me being exceptionally awesome if i were to limit it to two stories side by carrie i loved how she arranged the story in and giving enough information to keep you wondering where she was going with story also the ending was i love a ending that makes complete sense every children of the by maureen the zombies in this story were hidden from the main character certainly not from the reader the author had an amazing idea that seen before again the ending blew me away this time with deep meaning behind the staccato implications she explains what it feels like to become a zombie and it was by naomi the humor ran thick in this story and unicorns go surprisingly with humor the joke made me giggle and the idea of evil wizard in new york capturing baby unicorns to try to immortal and sending the rudest most antisocial unicorn to save is just absurd enough to meet my standards of care and feeding of your baby killer by diana despite the title leading me to believe this would be heavy on irony this story was rather serious in a lot of ways once you past the whole part the main displayed an amazing internal conflict and i loved all of references to her life before the story began it showed the lived before the story began also the undercurrent idea of nature nurture really stroked the thinker in my overall this was an anthology well worth my time i enjoyed it even though it always meet my personal standards it and if anyone was curious totally on team unicorn there never had been any doubt about

carrie ryan with some reservations and a few to my intelligence diana peterfreund before i started reading this i would say i was indifferent zombies and actively disdainful of anything involving unicorns read it all i am now enthralled with the former and even more disdainful of the latter part of this has to do with what for me a fair to middling anthology with a outstanding exceptions naomi novik carrie ryan with reservations and a few outright to my diana peterfreund cassandra before i started reading this would say i was indifferent to zombies and actively disdainful anything involving unicorns having read it all i am now with the former and even more actively disdainful of the latter of this has to do with what justine larbalestier notes in which creature better symbolizes the human condition the answer obviously zombies which can be used to comment on almost any aspect our existence they are walking entropy they are the dissolute of consumerism they are the eventual death that faces us all they a metaphor for slavery conformity and oblivion what are fluffy monochrome sticky you could try using unicorns to say something profound about the condition writ large but as the unicorn stories inadvertently or not most of the time all you get are problematic ideas about virginity purity and power not to say you or use fiction to explore these issues but introduction of unicorns in a story forces it into a certain kind binary that is unproductive at best and just icky at worst i think it says something that many of the stories here are parodic ones and that the ones that try to unicorns seriously whether as literary metaphors or as reality with origin stories and everything just make me embarrassed for the which also to say that zombie stories be ridiculous just that in theory zombies give you so much more room to do things or at least for me and my own reading sensibilities acknowledge that those without my unicorn bias will be able to different things from the stories in discussion as literary they are flexible in the ways described above as literal reality inject pure shots of adrenaline urgency tension and terror into plot in practice of course a mixed bag but even the most zombie story spurred my imagination in all sorts of directions and me spend way too much time googling things like why zombies so and what would happen to power grid if zombies see below proletariat zombie theory up to now i have tended to avoid zombie movies either because have proved to be unbearably suspenseful or gory or else boring because they are too suspenseful or gory but i find that suspense and gore are more manageable as fiction making me want to jump enthusiastically on the zombie bandwagon when before i it i know i am late to the game and i know that have become annoyingly overhyped in the interim but so be it onto zombie survival libba bray for example uses zombies to create just another teen dystopia story it is mediocre for a number of being one of them and world building being another example who is running the power plants that are providing the electricity a question i am apparently not alone in like see jul mika rated it of

the side of unicorn because i had always loved them growing up and really much can you do with zombies that already been done the answer is a lot and never look at macaroni and cheese same way again this touches on all the types of zombies lost souls to revenant still clinging to their mind sanity to virals who may or may not be dead they also manage to in a satire of which is not to say that team unicorn do anything strong new interesting it definitely pushed boundaries from killer unicorns the symbols of justice from period to modern the voices of unicorns are as varied as the stories themselves going from snarky lovelorn to confident these your for so in the end i declare this battle a firmly held tie with maybe edge going to the zombies read it for yourself and decide where like see nina at death books and apr nina at death books and tea rated it of review the concept love it a straight out war between zombies unicorns fought by some familiar faces and never of this is an

really happened it was just a this happened happened thing i liked the detailed descriptions but they slowed the story a bit too team zombie love will tear us apart by alaya dawn johnson i think whole idea was a zombie boy in love with a guy father hates zombies side note yes that is a homosexual relationship you have a problem with it get rid of it or at least keep it yourself etc people are just as awesome straight people if not more still not happy go away or be eaten insane at times however i make out much of plot but it was funny enjoyable with a little bit of brain thrown team unicorn team round team unicorn purity test by naomi novik this one was interesting shoved a unicorn into new york which is trying to find an entrance somewhere that ends up being called fairyland this was funny there just a plot at all however i liked how it changed perceptions of a unicorn and its virgin intosomething different and get me started on the baby unicorns and team by carrie ryan as the person who zombies to a young adult audience i expected good things and them while at times it was a little slow i think anyone would ever put pirates into a zombie story fun fun fun indeed and methods of destroying a zombie demonstrated in bougainvillea team unicorn team round team unicorn a thousand flowers by margo lanagan i must confess never got through this its the one with the avoid at costs is what i say team unicorn loses a point for this disturbing team of the revolution by maureen johnson highlights the dangers of horror as termed by grahme this being a zombie story our protagonist to babysit zombie babies this was a fun story with not too happening but still being team team round team care and feeding of your baby killer unicorn by peterfreund a completely new take on the unicorn closest we get to zombiefied unicorns nothing much happened but zombie unicorns mean i love team by scott westerfeld kids and adults living on pot farm while everyone else on earth is a zombie and then a few make plans to escape this was extremely boring and whilst he brilliant at writing steampunk westerfeld is no good at team unicorn team round team prettypants by meg cabot this was immense fun never thought enjoy meg cabot but it was so funny and protagonist ends up using her unicorn to deal with her problem this is the girliest story in the book with some for a zombie team zombie cold hands by cassandra clare this is the one where people simply stay dead a full love story and the heir dukedom or something like that completely comes back i liked this because normally zombie romance does not main reason being the zombie should want to eat the brains of partner more on that another day but clare made it work deciding which one team unicorn team zombie round team third virgin by kathleen duey this was edging the zombiefied unicorn team as well most unicorn stories involve unicorn saving the life of the human in this story this is very as long as the unicorn has taken a life as well this was interesting spin on unicorns but there a plot at team zombie prom night by libba bray this have a either not entirely sure of the point and i really the characters and i understand the team unicorn team round there actually a seventh story for each side this is more bonus round for the banter at the start of each story jl and discussing various things putting down the story if the story is the opposite side and defending it if its theirs fights something like unicorns are like this its good and repeated shamble and bits fall off and fights go but zombies are better because of this and unicorns are because insert new reason i love this banter jl team unicorn team total zombies win in terms of rounds of course these are my opinions and you probably agree not my just to let you know always preferred zombies to unicorns change my opinion so i say team zombie wins add opinions me and my book club will have this as one of our open for debates enjoy

just seriously loved isa she was so strong undoubtedly the most in the whole a thousand flowers by margo a short story is well short so why would you want to spent first five minutes on a guy just talking about where he wants to well that the strangest part this one was kind the children of the revolution by maureen johnson all time favorite right here sure it was bizarre not to mention read it while babysitting bad idea but it was crazy and exciting there was just something about the creepiness that i the care and feeding of your baby killer unicorn by diana i think this was probably the most story of them all had the thriller feel but it also had a love story i loved eve yes a guy a completely satisfying ending and so many tips when i stumble upon my own baby killer inoculata by scott westerfeld oh scott westerfeld will i ever find anything written that love if only there was more to this story love to what happens after the thousands of zombies start following princess prettypants by meg of cute hilarious and sweet in comparison to the rest of the stories loved it but of course i did meg cold hands by cassandra clare sadly i found this story kind of forgettable in a sea of zombies unicorns i guess it just stick out in my mind it interesting and kept my attention but the third virgin by kathleen duey this was the only story that was truly sad it made me want to love unicorn if only to save prom night by libba bray gah this story needs a book i loved it but i was just dying to about what happened before before they were anything random is so there you have it

friendship is magic cartoon disclaimer my little is a trademark of hasbro inc this is a fan illustration as are other pictures on this site and no challenge to status is intended aug dark lady unicorn steampunk inventor dark lady unicorn some time ago i established a sort of tradition of sorts that really should draw at least one unicorn a year or it just proper year and toward that end often scrambled to draw unicorn toward the end of the year often a pencil sketch wherever i happen to be on new eve and it rarely actually scanned in and sometimes is just given here i decided to something

pride and prejudice her favorite color is orange so those figured into the picture may doom unicorn doom a strange product of the phenomenon of i got any ideas of to draw while at the art jam a cute unicornish creature into the doom universe despite appearances sure that any encountered would be the ones in trouble aug warcraft unicorn warcraft another experiment in sketching directly in adobe photoshop as to the pencil scan and color method i usually employ this time a unicorn of the high elven lands of from the setting jul warcraft dark unicorn warcraft dark unlike my typical work this was drawn directly on the tablet than following my usual method of coloring in a scanned pencil i may have to work more on this method although very sketchy still has more of a painterly feeling than i can manage with sketch the subject is a dark unicorn from warcraft creature from the high elven lands of by fel magicks with the fall of the land to the evil scourge and swaying of the former high elves to pursue the dark arcane arts blood jul warcraft barrens unicorn zhevra warcraft zhevra a colorized sketch i drew at one of our art jams this time of creature known as a zhevra in the world of

pseudoscience randi is the of the james randi educational foundation randi began career as a magician as the amazing randi but after retiring at he began investigating paranormal occult and supernatural which he collectively calls although often referred to as debunker randi rejects that title owing to its perceived instead describing himself as an investigator he has written the paranormal skepticism and the history of magic he was a guest on the tonight show starring johnny carson and was featured on the television program penn teller out of out of see all customer they know they are making a good living by entertaining folks but magic is entertaining these guys are fooling people into something more andrew manikas reviewers made a this is why a real magicain is good to have when inventigating claim of a paranormal event david n reiss reviewers a similar the book is well written r reinstatler made a similar most helpful customer of people found the following review out of stars not amazing but pretty good september by jonah james randi is well renowned as one of the most skeptics as well he should be he has offered a million dollar to anyone who can prove in scientifically controlled tests that possess some kind of paranormal power go figure no one has ever able to do so and most psychics diviners etc simply refused to be tested a common excuse is that from interfers with their translation i can prove i can do anything as long as only people who are already firmly convinced that i this most interesting sections include accounts of some who have tried to claim this prize and often descriptions of trickery they tried to pull famous scams and are discussed the perpetrators range from the honestly mistaken to manipulated by others including children to the deluded to knowing liars not a read that will lift your opinion of but well worth the book is not without its flaws randi is correctly portrayed pissed off and given the insistent idiocy he deals with no surprise the topics veer through a hodgepodge of allegedly paranormal making it read a little too episodic at the prose gets dry for example the chapter on the cottingly goes into technical details about cameras which i had a tough worth noting are some false claims that negative reviewers have made amazon randi does not maintain a dogmatic insistance that paranormal claims are false he bases his belief that such claims hooey not on faith but on evidence having seen many many which are false and none that have proven true merely thinking he does not claim there are no paranormal powers and i prove it one cannot prove a negative like that quick can you the tuba can you prove to me that you moreover the burden proof does not lie with him if i say i can fly like superman you i who do you think should be assumed correct barring about my this book is a good one for those who value rational thinking are others that are better written to name just a few carl the demon haunted world robert voodoo science and own more focused the faith healers but i still give it high comments was this review helpful to of people found the following review out of stars few stones left unturned september by timothy p scanlon i formerly referred to another book available from httpaddr as great primer for those challenging new age nonsense and contemporary fads a fellow skeptic challenged that claim saying one is better i randi exposes more foolishness than any other of the texts from arthur conan doyle and his taste for fairies to the maharishi ufos and not subtle about his distaste for it granted he give credit to those who really believe in their craft for there are dousers and the like who really believe gifted the talent for the bizarre there are others however who are crooks lined up a gullible public with their credit cards actually appreciate powerful attitudes why get so as to soft pedal crooks he the book is a good primer because it covers so many subjects because it describes the reasoning process sure be the who dispute his findings but one will convince them of nothing least the reasoning process illustrated by this volume will those capable of the only reason i give it stars is that some of the samples gave would be better illustrated on a stage or a show it was a difficult for me to follow them in aside from that i think this should probably be required reading say high school seniors those particularly prone to the charlatans silly new age fads and other quackery but anyone wondering about fads could gain a great deal from comment was this review helpful to of people found the following review out of stars lunatics frauds and suckers december by a i saw a tv show about james randi recently in one scene he visited college classroom posing as an expert astrologer he had prepared told the class detailed individual horoscopes based on each birthdate and birthplace the students read these horoscopes rated their accuracy on a scale of one student gave his a every other horoscope got a the students were amazed worked randi then had them look at each horoscopes cries outrage filled the room all of the horoscopes were exactly the they had nothing whatsoever to do with birthdates or birthplaces any particular this book is full of such examples randi uses them and data and consistently careful analysis of facts to show that ideas as astrology biorhythms transcendental meditation ufos bermuda triangle esp and psychic surgery are quite simply in he offered to anyone who could demonstrate paranormal power under satisfactory observational conditions as of publication date over people had tried for the reward successfully some of the attempts are described in this book how psychics who have demonstrated the ability to bend metal rods will power do it anymore when they are no longer allowed wander out of the room with the rods during the a theme throughout the book is that people who want to something will accept the most absurd rationalizations in order continue to believe it in spite of overwhelming evidence at the beginning of his chapter on psychic surgery quotes william cowper to follow foolish precedents and wink both our eyes is easier than to think a similar theme arises langdon shantung compound about experiences as prisoner of war see my observing moral rationalize stealing food from each other gilkey concluded that greatest power of the human brain is not to reason but to doing whatever the owner wants to do for other examples this phenomenon read anything by a creation unfortunately randi is a professional magician not a writer his sentences are not always clear and he does not always references where they would be appropriate but his observations insightful and his writing is entertaining james randi is compassionate man fighting a good comments was this review helpful to see all customer reviews newest write a customer most

http://www.crystalinks.com/unicorns.html the unicorn is a mythical creature usually depicted with the body of horse but with single usually spiral horn growing out of its forehead thus its cornus latin for because of the purity its horn sometimes called was considered magical and became a popular ingredient medieval medicines its mere presence was considered a protection against poison in food and when worn in jewelry protected the wearer from alicorn was often worth more than its weight in gold so emperors and popes were among the few people able to pay the prices demanded they were eager to acquire the precious horn guarantee long and healthy lives with such a lucrative trade alicorn was rampant made from bull horn goat horn or in some from the horns of exotic animals or from ordinary dog complete unicom horns were very rare for example a complete horn owned by queen elizabeth i of england was valued at the time l the equivalent of about ounces of gold and enough to buy a large country estate complete with a castle rather coming from unicorns these complete horns often turned out to be long spirally twisted tusks of the male narwhal a large marine kings often placed alicorn on the table to protect themselves poisonous food and drink and until the revolution toppled the in the eating utensils used by french kings were made of horn to counteract any poison in the alleged unicorn adam garden of eden beginning of emperor fu hsi china years emperor huang di garden in china emperor yao china about confucius china ctesias india th century alexander the great asia rd century julius caesar germany st century prester john asia mid i i s genghis khan india early a prehistoric cave painting in lascaux france depicts an with two straight horns emerging from its forehead the profile perspective of the painting makes these two horns appear to a single straight horn since the species of the figure is unknown it has received the name the richard suggests that it like the sorcerer found at is therianthrope a blend of animal and human its head in interpretation is that of a bearded there have been unconfirmed reports of aboriginal paintings of at namaqualand in southern africa a passage of bruce journal in patagonia relates meeting a south scientist who believed that unicorns were among south megafauna of the late pleistocene and that they were hunted out existence by man in the fifth or sixth millennium bc he told who later sought them out about two aboriginal cave paintings unicorns at lago posadas cerro de los though the popular image of the unicorn is that of a white differing only in the horn the traditional unicorn has a beard a tail and cloven hooves which distinguish him from horse in even the earliest references he is fierce yet good yet solitary but always mysteriously in china the qilin a mythology creature sometimes called chinese it is portrayed as a hybrid animal that is unicorn than chimera with the body of a deer the head of a green scales and a long the japanese kirin though based on the chinese animal is portrayed as more closely resembling the western unicorn than chinese according to an interpretation of seals carved with an animal resembles a bull and which may in fact be a simplistic way depicting bulls in profile it has been claimed that the unicorn was common symbol during the indus valley civilization appearing on seals it may have symbolized a powerful social unicorns in the certain poetical passages of the biblical old testament refer to strong and splendid horned animal called this word translated unicorn or rhinoceros in many versions of the bible many modern translations prefer wild ox aurochs which is correct meaning of the hebrew the authorized version has references to the animal among them god brought them out of he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn numbers the biblical references appear to be due to a linguistic error made hebrew scholars in the rd century bc when they translated the into greek they rendered the hebrew meaning aurochs a ox by then extinct in the holy land as monoceros which translates the creek became a result the scriptures seemed to lend weight to the belief that animal as a biblical animal the unicorn was interpreted allegorically in early christian church one of the earliest such appears in the ancient greek bestiary known as the physiologus states that the unicorn is a strong fierce animal that can be only if a virgin maiden is thrown before it the unicorn leaps into lap and she suckles it and leads it to the medieval writers thus likened the unicorn to christ who raised up horn of salvation for mankind and dwelt in the womb of the virgin other legends tell of the combat with the elephant whom finally spears to death with its horn and of the of poisoned waters with its horn so that other animals may according to the book of genesis god gave adam the task of everything he saw in some translations of the bible the unicorn the first animal named thereby elevating it above all other beasts the universe when adam and eve left paradise the unicorn went them and came to represent purity and chastity thus the purity in the western legends stems from its biblical the bible also offers an explanation about why the unicorn has not seen for so long during the flood that engulfed the world for and nights noah took two of each animal to safety but were not among them a jewish folk tale mentions they were on board but demanded so much space and attention that noah them they either drowned or managed to swim during the flood and survive somewhere in the world or as some believe evolved into there are seven clear references to the unicorn in the old is now doubt about the original translations that have erroneously named anotheranimal as a the jewish talmud also makes many similar references to the unicorn jewish folklore it is the fiercest of all animals and is able to an elephant with a single thrust from its throughout history the church has interpreted the unicom in a of different ways inmedieval times it became a symbol of himself and its horn was symbolic of the unity of christ and some medieval paintings show the trinity with christ represented by unicom on the other hand the unicom also appears as a symbol of in the book of isaiah overall however the unicom has come to regarded as a pure and virtuous animal regardless of the place of unicom in biblical theory it is evident that there was a strong in the existence in biblical times as well as in following centuries it appears so often in the old testament that can hardly be overlooked in the christian world the fact that appears in the bible meant that no devout christian could doubt classical the unicorn does not appear in early greek mythology but instead greek natural history for greek writers on natural history convinced of the reality of the unicorn which they located in india distant and fabulous realm for them the encycloaedia britannica collects classical references to unicorns the earliest description from ctesias who described in indica white wild asses fleet of having on the forehead a horn a cubit and a half in length white red and black from the horn were made drinking cups which a preventive of aristotle must be following ctesias when he mentions two animals the oryx a kind of antelope and the indian pliny adds that it cannot be taken alive and quoting ctesias that india produces also a horse the monoceros sometimes called carcazonon which may be a form of the arabic meaning strabo says that in india there were horses with medieval medieval knowledge of the fabulous beast stemmed from biblical ancient sources the creature variously represented as a kind of ass goat or by ad tertullian had called the unicorn a small fierce animal and a symbol of christ the predecessor of the bestiary compiled in late antiquity and known as popularized an elaborate allegory in which a unicorn trapped by maiden representing the virgin mary stood for the incarnation soon as the unicorn sees her it lays its head on her lap and this became a basic emblematic tag that underlies medieval notions the unicorn justifying its appearance in every form of religious the unicorn also figured in courtly terms for some french authors such as thibaut of champagne and richard of the lover is attracted to his lady as the unicorn is to the this courtly version of salvation provided an alternative to and was assailed as with the rise of humanism the unicorn also acquired more secular meanings emblemmatic of chaste love and faithful marriage plays this role in triumph of the royal throne of denmark was made of unicorn the material was used for ceremonial cups because the continued to be believed to neutralize poison following the unicorn tamable only by a virgin woman was well established medieval lore by the time marco polo described them as smaller than elephants they have the hair of a buffalo and feet an they have a single large black horn in the middle of forehead they have a head like a wild they spend their time preference wallowing in mud and slime they are very ugly brutes look at they are not at all such as we describe them when we that they let themselves be captured by virgins but clean contrary our notions it is clear that marco polo was describing a in german since the sixteenth century einhorn has a descriptor of the various species of in popular belief examined wittily and at length in the century by sir thomas browne in his pseudodoxia epidemica horns could neutralize poisons book iii ch therefore who feared poisoning sometimes drank from goblets made of alleged aphrodisiac qualities and other purported medicinal also drove up the cost of unicorn products such as milk hide offal unicorns were also said to be able to determine whether or not woman was a virgin in some tales they could only be mounted one traditional method of hunting unicorns involved entrapment by the hunt of the the famous late gothic series of seven tapestry hangings the hunt the unicorn is a high point in european tapestry combining both secular and religious themes in the series dressed noblemen accompanied by huntsmen and hounds pursue a against millefleurs backgrounds or settings of buildings and they bring the animal to bay with the help of a maiden who traps with her charms appear to kill it and bring it back to a castle the last and most famous panel the unicorn in the is shown alive again and happy chained to a pomegranate surrounded by a fence in a field of scholars conjecture that the red stains on its flanks are not blood rather the juice from pomegranates which were a symbol of however the true meaning of the mysterious resurrected unicorn in last panel is unclear the series was woven about in the countries probably brussels or liege for an unknown patron a set six called the dame a la licorne lady with the unicorn at the de cluny paris woven in the southern netherlands about the same pictures the five senses the gateways to temptation and finally a mon seul desir the legend reads with unicorns in each the tapestries were bought by john d rockefeller in and are on display at the cloisters museum in new arms of in heraldry a unicorn is depicted as a horse with a hooves and beard a tail and a slender spiral horn on forehead whether because it was an emblem of the incarnation or of fearsome animal passions of raw nature the unicorn was not widely in early heraldry but became popular from the fifteenth though sometimes shown collared which may perhaps be taken in cases as an indication that it has been tamed or tempered it is usually shown collared with a broken chain attached showing that has broken free from its bondage and cannot be taken it is probably best known from the royal arms of scotland and united kingdom two unicorns support the scottish arms a lion and unicorn support the uk arms the arms of the society of apothecaries london has two golden unicorn since the rhinoceros is the only land animal to possess a single it has often been supposed that the unicorn legend originated encounters between europeans and rhinoceroses the woolly would have been quite familiar to people or the legend have been based on the surviving rhinoceroses of africa europeans west asians have visited africa for as long as we the roman empire also imported rhinoceroses for their arena along with hippopotamuses and other exotic creatures roman could distinguish between the african and indian rhinoceroses both which were slaughtered in front of huge chinese from the time of the han dynasty had also visited east which may account for their odd legends of voyages of zheng he brought back giraffes which identified by the chinese with another creature from their own one suggestion is that the unicorn myth is based on an extinct sometimes called the giant unicorn but known to scientists elasmotherium a huge eurasian rhinoceros native to the south of the range of the woolly rhinoceros of ice age elasmotherium looked little like a horse but it had a large horn in its forehead it seems to have become extinct about the time as the rest of the glacial age however according to the nordisk familjebok and to space willy ley the animal may have survived long enough to be remembered the legends of the evenk people of russia as a huge black bull with single horn in the even if elasmotherium is not the creature described by ibn ordinary rhinoceroses may have some relation to the unicorn in of this claim it has been noted that the th century traveller polo claimed to have seen a unicorn in java but his quoted above makes it clear to the modern reader that he actually a javanese the connection that is sometimes made with a goat from the vision of daniel recorded in book of daniel and as i was considering behold a came from the west over face of the whole earth and touched not the ground and the had a notable horn between his eyeswhich is soon exchanged four horns as a symbol of a great kingdom giving place to in the domestic goat a rare deformity of the generative tissues cause the horns to be joined together such an animal could be possible inspiration for the legend a farmer and a circus owner produced fake unicorns remodelling the horn buttons of goat kids such a way their horns grew deformed and joined in a seemingly single the narwhal relics ornamented with supposed unicorn horns can found in museums in vienna and elsewhere in central europe these horns are in fact the spiral tusks of the narwhal an cetacean monodon monoceros as danish zoologist ole worm in presumably they were brought to central europe as a item and sold as genuine unicorn horns passing the various intended to spot fake unicorn the oryx is an antelope with two long thin horns projecting from forehead some have suggested that seen from the side and from distance the oryx looks something like a horse with a single although the projects backward not forward as in the conceivably travelers in arabia could have derived the of the unicorn from these animals however classical authors seem distinguish clearly between oryxes and the eand in southern africa the eland has somewhat mystical spiritual connotations perhaps at least partly because this very antelope will defend itself and others against lions and was able kill these fearsome predators at a time when people had poisoned arrows to defend themselves with eland are frequently depicted in the rock art of the region which implies they were viewed as having a strong connection to the other world in several languages the word for eland and for dance is the significant because shamans used dance as their means of drawing from the other world eland fat was used when mixing the pigments these pictographs and in the preparation of many medicines special regard for the eland may well have been picked up by travellers in the area of cape town one horned eland are known occur naturally perhaps as the result of a recessive gene and noted in the diary of an early governor of the cape there is also purported unicorn horn in the castle of the mcleod clan chief scotland which has been identified as that of an unicorn the true origins lie in the depths of time in beginningless beginning when all was emptiness and waste darkness mist then moved the holy one to sunder the dark from the bright were established concord and balance with darkness driven to fringes and the abode of light at the middle point of all but once given a situation and compass for itself grew weighty accounting intruding among all things and drawing them toward according to their weights and therefore was the balance made to tremble and from that arose a resonance an awesome sound that circled in the emptiness chanting mightily the holy one modulated that sound to of it a chord of great sweetness and breathed into its so that it might become a spirit of harmony and guidance unto corner of the void this was the powerful spirit called whirling itself through uncounted ages while ever spiraling around central light and while some things still fell into darkness galgallim guided others on a more rarified path toward the shores light in such a way was balance achieved once then the holy one wished for a panel on which to display his art and between the shores of light and the walls of darkness he in balance the earth its naked mountains he raised in fire scattered them with shining gems that still reflect those flames the holy one addressed to the spirit of guidance which is saying out of the hidden gulfs i made thee free and by unbounded wilt thou accept shape upon earth that thou mayst supply service even greater and even as it was asked so it was wrapped in a cloud came he by a bright whirlwind borne along descended gently from the heavens to the infant fields of earth before the fires of its forming were yet subdued thus did the possess the brightness of the light that he might drive all and obscurity from he was called asallam of unicorns the firstborn a creature wrought and wonderful to behold bearing a horn of spiral light that the sign of galgallim the guide now with his horn asallam struck barren rock piercing it to a great depth and drew forth a spring of life wherever those waters flowed fires were quenched the earth was made fertile with a multitude of fruitful things trees rose up and blossomed and under their shade came beasts wild and tame all this was by the intent of the holy one and unicorn was the instrument of his will in such a way was formed garden of the unicorn called shamagim which means the place there is the holy one then addressed the firstborn saying asallam of all creations thou alone shalt ever recall thy making and dwell remembrance unbroken of the light to be its guide and guardian never to the light shalt thou return until the final hour of the of and the unicorn dwelled in his garden and went walking abroad in wonder when the holy one wished to make himself known even as things were known to him into himself withdrawing from earth and water and fire his sacred breath compounded man who was strong fair being the crown of all great ion looking upon man the marveled and became suddenly modest and shy and because asallam no part in making the unicorn loved man the more and before him as a servant thus was the unicorn the first beast that beheld and the first to which he gave a name from that time to the fates of these two races have been bound

memphis as a solo trip been to see graceland for a while and i had a flight voucher i had to by the end of may so i ended up there it was a short weekend trip i landed in nashville then drove hours each way to memphis worth it if you can do it and mind the drive which admit was getting kind of slap happy on the final hour on the way the drive was a bit uneventful as not much to see for hours and i was by graceland mansion is an experience in itself it was basically a mishmash of rooms filled with and shag carpet stuffed animals and peacocks and peanut butter and bananas after the tour i ended up at the civil rights museum a few miles from graceland the museum itself is in the lorraine motel the where martin luther king jr was it was quite a moving experience if you are in memphis i recommend going amazing i loved everything about memphis that i sure a bit seedy in parts which is what people told me before left but i loved flash forward to hours i finally got back into nashville

answers to both questions at answers genesis the official blog of the group behind the ark encounter group says yes to both which implies that their creationist park will include dinosaurs and

http://glitterandunicorns-angiebee.blogspot.com/ and unicorns atom glitter and unicorns and my place for all things nail polish and about disclosure policy pr may nail wrap review aly en hey guys i have something a little different today because never tried this kinda product before and been a little weary i was contacted by nail polish canada if i wanted to try some of these ncla nail wraps and i jumped at chance always wanted to try some i even have quite a different sets but have never worked up the nerve to use them i wanted to try them cause they looks stiff and lift at corners which would drive me read on for my thoughts on these are the two i chose aly en vogue the floral one the kit comes with two sheets of wraps each a nail file the first one i chose to try was aly en vogue each wrap has different lovely floral design i love that not all the design on each wrap you can see in a couple pics above that each has a different color for the chevron is this a chevron side is a nude and the other is a peachy now for the review these were easier than i expected them to but they were still a pita for a few of my nails what i mean by is a few of my nails and when i say that i mean almost all of nails are curved from cuticle to tip and i found that these do apply easy to nails like that my pinky and ring finger nails on hands are fairly strait from cuticle to tip but the rest of my have a slight curve what i found was that these wraps would at that curve in my i also found these difficult to size hard to figure out the you need when you put into consideration the side to side curve of nail my nails are very curved so i found that i would pick a thinking it would fit and it would be really too small you will see i picked a size a little too big for my middle finger and had overlapping of my another thing to note is that these are hard to fix if you place wrong you have to place them right the first time cause if and try to fix them they stretch a lot and become warped and you can see evidence of that on the side of my ring the other thing i like is when you file off the tip i stand the sight of bare tips someone that wraps her tips seeing there drives me see the wrinkle in the curve of my i sound highly critical of these because well a these actually do look good from far away but again perfectionist so knowing that they perfect drove me crazy took these off pretty soon pretty sure these are easier to apply than other wraps if you have strait nails but alas i think this kinda product made for nails like these and other ncla products can be purchased at nail canada they have a wide range of a lot of different polishes and art this product was sent for posted by angie at am comments links to labels ncla may hey guys i have a fun mani to share with you today i wanted to do fun ombre but then i thought well an ombre gradient and i like how it turned out though i now wish i had used different color on my ring finger i was going for a light minty to a blue green and ending with blue and the color on my ring was just blue i wish it was more blue green oh notice my awkward little thumb there is no good way to photograph my ahh my chunky monkey thumb used from thumb to pinky essence the boy next door shopping portobello road essie my chauffeur china kinetic candy and zoya neely and the glitter is of course one of favorite glitter china glaze

of drove by and then stopped all the kids and the bus driver watched amazement thinking it was really a unicorn vavra and his hid in the bushes quite enjoying themselves this book is a collection on

comment was this review helpful to of people found the following review out of stars brought back the passion with which i as a child october by a true believer of unicorns as a unicorn fanatical child i entertained notions i might be one as an adult i bring to disbelieve in them they are to me the epiphany of the beauty magik and perfection the world has to offer they are the of it and yet and yet it is hard to find a modern of them which overdo the glitter and the rainbows human characteristics and sloppy sentimentality to the beasts sick the tacky trendy representations of unicorns in the today book was a blessing when i received it as a gift last year beautiful glorious heart warming pictures of unicorns in their natural habitats free from sparkles and glittery adornment wild and free as all unicorns be accompanied by unicorn text from a multitude of sources thousands of years ago to the very present and always encouragement to believe oh i do believe this book is a perfect for anyone who feel the magik of the unicorn young and old alike will fill your heart with hope and faith and that perfect wonder comes over us when our imaginations have been my heart felt as though it would break upon reading then at this vavra talking about such details as how they kept the horns stuck the horses then it occured to maybe he just wants us to think they were really horses so that tries to hunt them downto protect them and keep them sacred to them comment was this review helpful to see all customer reviews newest write a customer most recent customer out of stars unicorns i
