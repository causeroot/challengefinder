joint image by images via should we look to google the company not the search engine lessons on economic growth and employment eric executive chairman and until last april executive thinks what got goes way beyond google proved that you could systematize innovation he told recently adding that this meant you could create an where are asking why things are the way they are and wondering if can be done in a different way where you look outside your own for an whether you think that can be made universal depends on first pass whether you feel google is some kind of special case on the one google makes a fortune all like to emulate profits per employee in the quarter ending last month more ibm or goldman sachs though still less than apple it also does impressive job on innovation continuously scaling up a system the likes of which the world has never on the other hand google is a ludicrously small employer with workers about as many toil at one boeing factory in everett foxconn has more than times that many people ipods just in longhua china plus most of those google people smarter than the rest of us that make it a special particularly at a time when we need to put millions of people to work one way you do that at scale is manufacturing at some numbers if you need no matter how smart or you are though argue capable of working out ways to improve your environment at the ingenuity of any wait or sales person in juggling routes shifts or how people in conditions of scarcity be it a disaster resource deprivation even confinement figure workarounds and communications systems to teach each that is what innovation is all about applying new inventions and of seeing to existing systems and a universal we just have put it into our daily working lives to that end google can teach early on we put in a system of mechanisms for innovating said citing the system this was a that everyone should spend of their time on their core job part of another team and on something blue sky it was honored in name more than the event heard from insiders got a critical job and a tight deadline you give it up that mark it was however a good way for people to see all around google and test them against their own in addition said schmidt the leadership in particular the larry page and sergey brin spent a lot of time on this on having original ideas if you had an idea that was

there are many many more examples in addition knowing how stitch in your acquisitions is no minor permalink matthew herper matthew herper forbes staff year agree that pagerank in particular was hugely innovative and think comments about six sigma are right on be managed as if it were a manufacturing line or sales but i also think that google has not proved it is a model my bias i think computer innovation is overvalued by use society partly because it creates changes very suddenly everybody notices google came out and everybody switched altavista gmail came out and yahoo mail got replaced we speed for pagerank was a huge and instantly disruptive innovation was a great way to generate revenue but how much of what has done since really ranks as brand new or indispensable can really say that corporate culture has created that to me it seems google has done an exceptional job of managing disruption created by its founding ideas and technology but see proof that since it became a large company it continued to be a huge engine of innovation it sounds like may be stuff in the pipeline that fits the that themselves etc and here to be convinced but that google is so innovative that the rest of us should be permalink year all of which is of no interest whatever to of permalink quentin hardy quentin hardy forbes staff year i had no idea the number of people using these products

understand what you mean by this except to say we all things yes we do how we reach those rankings clever about innovative the order with most of advertising on page page rank as described in the original paper is about using to determine order that was an interesting invention however amounts to blending invention into an existing say they did that and give schmidt et al credit in the and if innovation is my innovation why are they so to keep the details secret from secrecy is one of less attractive qualities but not so exceptional in this context i really understand google is pure

to the steam locomotive at least if into the topic rebecca book river of shadows but this also plays on our innate need for more information i believe borders on the there is no such thing the elemental mind as too much information about predators or opportunities now we extend that to ims and email to our regret something will have to give in the data permalink chunka mui chunka mui contributor year the challenge at the top is the tallest order since falls apart when the mindset up there is wrong a rotting at the base kills a company gradually bad leadership can it one of the smartest innovation models that seen is abc model he says there should be three levels a and c the a process focuses on the core task eg building widgets the b level should focus on improving the a process improving cycle time quality cost etc the c level should on improving the b level most innovation is stuck at the faster better and cheaper focus the b level as companies get older b level processes delegated downward lowering ambition and authority for change level improvement processes like six sigma also calcify over and often no mechanism for recognizing disruptive too often there is little or no c level activity going amazing that google worries about innovation at level as opposed just hoping that insights happen by themselves as most companies by itself impressive i know managers at many that are green with envy but i think google would do well to measure that time according to categories but the that founders are stressing this problem as opposed delegating it bodes well it does not hurt of course trying out their ideas in a massively growing permalink quentin hardy quentin hardy forbes staff year excellent points chunka i see your point about time but i think operating in a of different areas with different payoffs so that is having it covered by search which is still of revenues in form or another covers a lot of what others might call and call permalink knowledgenotebook knowledgenotebook year thoughtful a few a plenty of innovative people out there a key challenge is policy level administrator type has an incentive to innovation without paying a huge price supporting pilot is a start but afraid not the b type requires precision which is of against creativity so extremely demanding to be good both at the same having said that software is

http://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/quarterly/innovation/8-pillars-of-innovation.html quarterly by privacy terms of contact think with think with google eight pillars of as employee susan wojcicki has learned a thing or about innovation what learned and what she continues work words by susan illustration by robert samuel let us know what you the greatest innovations are the ones we take for granted like bulbs refrigeration and penicillin but in a world where miraculous very quickly becomes how can a especially one as big as google maintain a spirit of innovation after nurturing a culture that allows for innovation is the key as grown to over employees in more than offices hard to maintain the unique spirit that characterized google way when i joined as employee at that time i was head of marketing a group of one and over past decade been lucky enough to work on a wide range of some were big wins others although much has changed the years i believe our commitment to innovation and risk has different is that even as we dream up next we face classic dilemma should we invest in brand new products should we improve existing ones we believe in doing both and while we do it here are eight principles of innovation picked along the way to guide us as we a mission that work can be more than a job when it stands for something you about mission is to the information make it universally accessible and we use this statement to guide all of our decisions when we start work in a area often because we see an important issue that solved and confident that technology can make a difference example gmail was created to address the need for more web functionality great search and more our mission is one that has the potential to touch many lives and make sure that all our employees feel connected to it and empowered help achieve it in times of crisis they have helped by information and making it readily available the googlers who launched our person finder tool to learn more missions that matter within two hours of the earthquake tsunami in japan this march are a wonderful recent example of big but start no matter how ambitious the plan you have to roll up your sleeves start somewhere google books which has brought the content millions of books online was an idea that our founder larry page for a long time people thought it was too crazy even to try but went ahead and bought a scanner and hooked it up in his office began scanning pages timed how long it took with a metronome ran numbers and realized it would be possible to bring the online today our book search index contains over million similarly adsense which delivers contextual ads to started when one engineer put ads in gmail we realized that with sophisticated technology we could do an even better job by additional resources to this tiny project today adsense ads reach percent of global internet users it is the largest ad and we have hundreds of thousands of publishers for continual innovation not instant the best part of working on the web we get lots of them first version of adwords released in very almost no one clicked on the ads not many people remember because we kept iterating and eventually reached the model we today and still improving it every year we run tens thousands of search and ads quality experiments and over the past launched over a dozen new formats some products we update our iterative process often teaches us invaluable lessons users the as they use our products is the best way to out what works then we can act on that feedback much better learn these things early and be able to respond than to go too far the wrong iterating has served us well we first to search but we able to make progress in the market by working quickly learning and taking our next steps based on for ideas as the leader of our ads products i want to hear ideas from everyone and that includes our partners advertisers and all of the people on team i also want to be a part of the conversations googlers are in the several years ago we took this quite literally and posted an board on a wall at headquarters in mountain view on a night an engineer went to the board and wrote down the details of convoluted problem we had with our ads system a group of lacking exciting plans for the evening began the within hours and had solved the problem by some of the best ideas at google are sparked just like that small groups of googlers take a break on a random afternoon and talking about things that excite them the google art which brought thousands of museum works online and successful features like automated rules are great examples of projects started out in our this is why we make sure google stocked with plenty of snacks at all our employees know pretty much everything going on and decisions are made every quarter we share the entire board with all employees and we present the same slides presented the board of directors in a by sharing everything you encourage the discussion exchange of ideas which can lead to unexpected and outcomes we try to facilitate this by working in small crowded in open cube arrangements rather than individual when someone has an idea or needs input on a decision they can look up and say to the person sitting next to them maybe will have something to contribute as well the idea language translation in google talk our gmail chat client out of conversations between the google talk and google teams when they happened to be working near one with imagination fuel with in our market hard for people to know or imagine what they want why we recruit people who believe impossible can become a reality one example is sebastian who along with his team is building technology for driverless cars reduce the number of lives lost to roadside accidents each year cars still in development have logged driving down san famously twisty lombard street across golden gate bridge and up the pacific coast highway without a we try to encourage this type of thinking through a full day a week during which engineers can work on they want looking back at our launch calendar over a recent period we found that many products started life in percent what begins with intuition is fueled by insights if these reinforce one another for a while the number of google results displayed on a page was simply because our founders that was the best number we eventually did a test asking you like or search results on one unanimously said they wanted but results did far better actual user tests because the page loaded faster it turns out providing results was percent slower than providing and users really wanted was speed the beautiful thing about data it can either back up your instincts or prove them totally a there is so much innovation being driven by people over the globe why we believe so strongly in the power of technologies they enable anyone anywhere to apply their skills perspectives and passions to the creation of new products features on top of our this openness helps to move the needle forward for everyone google earth for example allows developers to build top of our maps and share them with the world one user created a that uses animations of sensor data to illustrate what happen if sea levels rose from one to meters another example of open technology is our mobile platform android are currently over devices on the market built on the android and close to half a million android developers outside the company enjoy the support of extensive resources these developers are responsible for most of the apps in the fail to google is known for youtube not google video player the thing people remember your hits more than your misses okay to fail long as you learn from your mistakes and correct them fast trust failed plenty of times knowing that okay to fail can you up to take risks and the tech industry is so dynamic that moment you stop taking risks is the moment you get left two of the first projects i worked on at google adsense and answers were both uncharted territory for the company while grew to be a business google answers which users post questions and pay an expert for the answer was after four years we learned a lot in that time and we were able apply the knowledge we had gathered to the development of products if been afraid to fail we never would have tried answers or adsense and missed an opportunity with each our growing google workforce comes to us from all over the bringing with them vastly different experiences and backgrounds a of strong common principles for a company makes it possible for all employees to work as one and move forward together we just need continue to say and resist a culture of accept inevitability of failures and continue iterating until we get as it says on our homepage feeling certainly how feel coming to work every day and something i never want to take previous article next that by holly science fiction behind by amit

http://www.stanford.edu/~nbloom/PevertedU.pdf competition and innovation an paper investigates the relationship between product market competition and innovation we find strong evidence of an relationship using panel data we develop a model where competition discourages laggard firms from innovating but encourages firms to innovate together with the effect of competition on the equilibrium industry structure these generate an two additional predictions of the the average technological distance between leaders and followers increases with competition and that the is steeper when industries are more both supported by the have long been interested in the relationship between competition and innovation but economic theory seems to be contradicted by the evidence theories of industrial typically predict that innovation should decline with competition while empirical work finds that it increases this paper reexamines this relationship using panel data and finds clear nonlinearities in the form of an shape illustrated by figure i which plots patents against the lerner index with an exponential quadratic overlay the possibility of an between competition and innovation was hinted at by scherer who showed a positive relationship the authors would like to thank daron acemoglu william baumol bresnahan jan boone wendy carlin paul david janice eberly edward glaeser dennis ranque mark shankerman robert solow manuel trajtenberg alwyn young john van reenen two anonymous referees and participants at seminars including canadian institute of advance research harvard university and massachusetts institute of technology financial support for this project was provided by the economic and social research council esrc centre for the microeconomic analysis of public policy at the institute for fiscal studies and the advanced institute of management aim initiative the data were developed with funding from the leverhulme see our discussion in section iii below however the replacement effect in arrow and the efficiency effects in gilbert and newbury and reinganum go in the opposite see geroski nickell and blundell griffith and van by the president and fellows of harvard college and the massachusetts institute of quarterly journal of economics may journal of activity and firm size in the cross section with a impact at larger sizes when allowing for our knowledge no existing model of product market competition and innovation predicts an explanation for these results could be pieced together by combining agency models with schumpeterian models however this seems unsatisfactory instead we develop an extension of aghion harris and vickers that can fit the entire this model both current technological leaders and their followers in any industry can innovate and innovations by leaders and followers all occur innovation incentives depend not so much upon postinnovation rents as in previous endogenous growth models where all innovations are made by outsiders but upon the difference between postinnovation and preinnovation rents of incumbent firms in this case more competition may foster innovation and growth because it may reduce a preinnovation rents by more than it reduces its postinnovation rents in other words competition may increase the incremental profits from innovating and thereby encourage investments aimed at this should be particularly true in sectors where incumbent firms are operating at similar technological levels in these sectors preinnovation rents should be especially reduced by product market competition on the other hand in sectors where innovations are made by laggard firms with already low initial profits product market competition will mainly affect postinnovation rents and therefore the schumpeterian effect of competition should essence of the relationship between competition and innovation is that the fraction of sectors with competitors is itself endogenous and depends upon equilibrium innovation intensities in the different types of sectors more specifically when competition is low a larger equilibrium fraction of sectors involve competing incumbents so that overall the effect is more likely to dominate the schumpeterian effect on the other hand when competition is high the schumpeterian effect is more likely to dominate because a larger fraction of sectors in equilibrium have innovation being performed by laggard firms with low initial profits the shape is confirmed by our u k panel hart schmidt aghion dewatripont and rey see also aghion harris howitt and vickers and and it is robust to a number of controls and model provides additional testable predictions on the relationship between competition and the composition of industries and more specifically between competition and the average degree of in the economy which are also by the rest of the paper is structured as follows section ii displays the empirical evidence on the existence of an between competition and innovation section iii argues that existing models of competition and innovation cannot account for the pattern we develop a theoretical rationale for this relationship derive some additional empirical predictions and validate them with data finally section the impact of competition on early empirical literature inspired by estimated linear relationships and typically found a negative relationship between competition and innovation confirming the theoretical prejudices of the era developed this research by allowing for additional nonlinearities and in a analysis of fortune firms discovered a significant shape with higher competition initially increasing then decreasing the rate of research since then has returned to estimating linear specifications for example nickell and blundell griffith and van reenen both find a positive linear effect of competition on innovation in this paper we allow for a nonmonotonic measuring is a large literature on measuring innovation intensity with the most commonly used measures being expenditure and patenting activity we use the average number of to deal with the possible endogeneity of competition we use u k data and exploit the major policy reforms undertaken over the s and s which dramatically changed the nature and extent of competition across industries and over time the radical policies of the thatcher administration the introduction of the european single market program smp and the reforms imposed by the monopolies and mergers commission together provide a number of policy changes that vary across time and industries and allow us to identify the causal impact of competition on journal of taken out by firms in an industry and to reflect the heterogeneous value of patents we weight each patent by the number of times it has been cited by another patent these data are generated by matching the nber patents database to accounting data on firms listed on the london stock exchange from our sample includes all firms with names beginning to plus all large firms after removing firms involved in large mergers or acquisitions and those with missing data we have an unbalanced panel of firms spanning seventeen sic codes over the period we also have information on citations to and from each patent which enables us to construct a count of patents we take the average value of patents of firms within each industry sic code in each year we do not observe a sufficient number of firms in all industries in all years so our resulting industry level panel is also unbalanced with observations some descriptive statistics are provided in appendix measuring main indicator of product market competition is the lerner index or price cost margin following nickell this measure has several advantages over indicators such as market share or the herfindahl concentration index these other measures rely more directly on precise definitions of geographic and product markets which is particularly difficult in our application as many u k firms operate in international markets so that market concentration measures based only on u k data may be extremely price cost margin we use is measured by operating profits net of depreciation provisions and an estimated financial cost of capital divided by profit financial see hall jaffe and trajtenberg the nber database contains the patents taken out in the u s patent office which is where innovations are effectively patented internationally dated by the time of the cost of capital is assumed to be for all firms and time periods and the capital stock is measured using the perpetual inventory method the shape is robust to excluding this financial cost from the lerner measure principally because it is relatively small and constant over and competition measure is the average of this across firms within the i indexes firms j indexes industry t indexes time and njt is the number of firms in industry j in year t a value of perfect competition price equals marginal cost while values below indicate some degree of market power in this index we use the entire sample of stock market listed firms in each industry not only those in the patenting a nonlinear use flexible nonlinear estimators to investigate the basic shape of the relationship between competition and n as the hazard rate and c as the measure of competition we start by defining the competition innovation relationship where is some unknown that the patent process has a poisson distribution with hazard rate then the expected number of patents satisfies models that study count data processes typically base their specification on the poisson model with a parametric linear form for g c but they relax the strong assumptions on higher moments we follow this approach in our empirical analysis basing our estimator on the first moment we adopt a flexible specification for g c because we are particularly interested in allowing the data to determine the shape of the relationship between innovation and product market is very likely that different industries will have observed levels of patenting activity that have no direct causal relationship with product market competition but reflect other institutional features of the industry consequently industry fixed effects are essential to remove any spurious correlation or of this type time effects are also included to remove common shocks conditional on industry and time effects see hausman hall and griliches for journal of plot of innovation on figure plots a measure of competition on the against patents on the each point represents an the scatter shows all data points that lie in between the tenth and ninetieth deciles in the patents distribution the exponential quadratic curve that is overlaid is reported in column of table patent behavior is related to industry competition according p cjt where x represents a complete set of time and industry dummy we use moment condition to define a moment estimator and approximate g c with a spline following ai and chen figure i we show the scatter of data points in between the tenth and ninetieth deciles of the patent distribution and overlay a fitted exponential quadratic curve the same exponential quadratic curve is plotted together with a spline approximation in figure ii it can be seen that the exponential quadratic specification provides a very reasonable approximation to the nonparametric spline and that they both show a clear shape the estimated coefficients for the exponential quadratic model are presented in table i the first column shows that both the linear and quadratic terms are individually and jointly significant in the second column we reestimate including industry effects which is our preferred specification competition and and competition exponential quadratic and the semiparametric specifications with year and industry figure plots a measure of competition on the against patents on the each point represents an the circles show the exponential quadratic curve that is reported in column of table i the triangles show a nonparametric which removes the bias that results from correlation between permanent levels of innovative activity and product market competition and again find a significant underlying distribution of the data is shown by the intensity of the points on the estimated curves these indicate that the peak of the inverted u lies near the median of the distribution the median is so that industries are well spread across the we can also see that a linear relationship would yield a positive slope confirming the results presented in nickell before moving to the results using the policy instruments we consider three robustness checks the first uses averages to estimate this relationship in view of the potential lags in the relationship between competition and innovation as shown in the third column of table i this also displays a clear shape the second robustness check not shown uses expenditure as an alternative innovation measure again we find an shape although due to a the data span a year period to therefore the first period was set at seven years with the remainder at five years journal of quadratic basic variable of competition of policy reduced of other reduced functions in of reduced jt is measured by lerner index in the all columns are estimated using an unbalanced

specified in table ii imports over in the same tfp in the same output minus variable costs over output in the same and estimates of markups from regression martins et al interacted with time trend all for the united states and smaller sample the coefficients are not statistically significant finally we fit the relationship for each of the top four innovating industries in our sample and in each case there is part or all of an shape see the earlier working paper version of this paper aghion et al using policy major obstacle to empirical research in this area is that competition and innovation are mutually endogenous without addressing this any results we find are likely to be biased toward in the united kingdom was not a mandatory reporting item prior to so it is not available for the majority of firms prior to this date this is one of the reasons we use patents as our main innovation and but differential market action action and action a more negative relationship between competition and innovation if higher levels of innovation act for example to reduce competition we address this problem by using a set of policy instruments that provide exogenous variation in the degree of industrywide competition since we are including industry and time effects this approach identifies the competition effect through the differential timing of the introduction of policy changes across industries the three sets of policy instrument used are the thatcher era privatizations the eu single market programme and the monopoly and merger commission investigations that resulted in structural or behavioral remedies being imposed on the industry table ii lists the policy instruments that are used the industries that are affected and the in which the policy changes use these policy variables to instrument the changes in competition these policy changes were driven by a combination of political orthodoxy desires for european integration and responses to anticompetitive behavior with little obvious link to innovation performance we specify a model for the competition see for example the endogenous barrier to entry story in sutton see the earlier working paper version for full details of all the policy instruments aghion et al the single market program differentially increased trade liberalization across u k industries in all tariff and nontariff barriers were phased out with the increase in competition depending on the extent of tariff and nontariff barriers the european cechinni report ranked all sic industries into low medium and high impact and we use this ranking for our policy instrument journal of assumes that e v z x where z denote the policy the idea is then to use functions of the v in an extended version of the moment condition to strip out any element of is endogenous with the error control function assumption can be expressed as xjt that controlling for the conditional moment condition to retrieve the conditional moment fourth column in table i shows the estimates for our exponential quadratic specification that control for endogeneity using our set of instruments the coefficient estimates are similar to the second column in the bottom part of the table we present some diagnostic statistics they show that the instruments are significant in the reduced form that the policy instruments in particular are significant and that they have explanatory relationship between innovation and product market competition for the standard quadratic and also for the instrumented quadratic display a similar explaining the inverted main existing theories of competition and innovation in this subsection we briefly summarize what existing theories have to say about the relationship between competition and innovation or competition and productivity growth as it turns out none of them can account for the pattern in the previous leading io models of product differentiation and monopolistic competition namely salop and dixit and deliver the prediction that more intense product market competition reduces postentry rents and therefore reduces the equilibrium number of entrants thus these models can only account for the decreasing part of the curve increased to recover the parameters of interest we integrate over the empirical distribution of v and recover the structural see blundell and powell increased product market competition is modeled as a reduction in unit transport cost in salop or as an increase in the substitutability between differentiated products in dixit and stiglitz and market competition discourages innovation by reducing postentry rents this prediction is shared by most existing models of endogenous growth eg romer aghion and and grossman and helpman where an increase in product market competition or in the rate of imitation has a negative effect on productivity growth by reducing the monopoly rents that reward new all the papers firms are simply individuals instead hart considers the case of firms run by managers who do not value profits per se but yet draw private benefits from maintaining the firm afloat and thereby keeping their job then increased competition may induce otherwise reluctant managers to put more effort into reducing costs in order to avoid bankruptcy however this does not generate an relationship between competition and managerial incentives either most firms have managers who are a sufficiently residual claimant over the monetary revenue in which case we again obtain a negative correlation between competition and innovation or they are run by satisficing managers in which case competition is unambiguously good for a theoretical is a unit mass of identical consumers each supplying a unit of labor inelastically with a constant rate of intertemporal discount r and a logarithmic instantaneous utility function u y ln y the consumption good y is produced at each date t input services from a continuum of intermediate sectors according to the production y which each x is an aggregate of two intermediate goods by duopolists in sector j defined by the subutility function in these models the reason why competition policy is unambiguously detrimental to growth is the same as the reason why patent protection is unambiguously good for growth patent protection raises monopoly rents from innovation whereas increased product market competition destroys these this positive effect of competition disappears if managers value monetary payoffs sufficiently as shown by scharfstein and more recently by journal of logarithmic structure of implies that in equilibrium individuals spend the same amount on each basket x we this common amount to unity by using current expenditure as the numeraire for the prices each the representative household chooses each x and to the budget constraint p firm produces using labor as the only input according to a production function and takes the wage rate as given thus the unit costs of production c and c of the firms in an industry are independent of the quantities produced now let k denote the technology level of duopoly firm i in some industry j that is one unit of labor currently employed by firm i generates an output flow equal to a is a parameter that measures the size of a innovation equivalently it takes ki units of labor for firm i to produce one unit of output the state of an industry is then fully characterized by a pair of integers l m where l is the technology and m is the technology gap of the leader over the follower we define respectively to be the profit flow of a firm m steps ahead of respectively behind its expositional simplicity we assume that knowledge spillovers between leader and follower in any intermediate industry are such that the maximum sustainable gap is m that is if a firm already one step ahead innovates the lagging firm will automatically learn to copy the previous technology and thereby remain only one step behind thus at any point in time there will be two kinds of intermediate sectors in the economy i leveled or sectors where both firms are at technological par with one another so that m ii unleveled sectors where one firm the leader lies one step ahead of its competitor the laggard or follower in the same industry so that m the above logarithmic technology along with the cost structure c x x k implies that the profit in the industry depends only on the gap m between the two firms and not on absolute levels of aghion et al analyze the more general case where m is however unlike in this section that paper provides no solution for the equilibrium levels and the industry structure competition and spending the cost n n in units of labor a leader or frontier firm moves one technological step ahead with a poisson hazard rate of n we call n the of the firm we assume that a follower firm can move one step ahead with hazard rate h even if it spends nothing on by copying the technology thus n is the cost of a follower firm moving ahead with a hazard rate n let n denote the intensity of each firm in a industry and let denote the intensity of a follower in an unleveled industry if n denotes the intensity of leader in an unleveled industry note that n since our of automatic means that a leader cannot gain any further advantage by model the degree of product market competition inversely by the degree to which the two firms in a industry are able to collude they do not collude when the industry is unlevel thus the laggard in an unlevel industry makes zero profit while the leader makes a profit equal to the difference between its revenue which we have normalized to unity and its cost which is times its revenue given that its price is times its unit firm in a level industry earns a profit of if the firms are unable to collude since they are in bertrand competition with identical products and identical unit costs and if there is collusion more generally we assume we parameterize product market competition by that is one minus the fraction of a profits that the level firm can attain through collusion note that is also the incremental profit of an innovator in a industry normalized by the next analyze how the equilibrium research intensities n and consequently the aggregate innovation rate vary our measure of therefore cannot formally establish qualitative results such as the existence of an relationship between competition and innovation or characterize the relationship between competition and the distribution of technological journal of the schumpeterian and effects we assume that the equilibrium innovation rates n and n determined by the necessary conditions for a symmetric equilibrium in which each firm seeks to maximize expected discounted profits with a discount rate r in appendix we the equilibrium research intensity by each firm increases with higher product market competition whereas the equilibrium research intensity of a laggard firm decreases with higher product market competition latter effect on is the basic schumpeterian effect results from reducing the rents that can be captured by a follower who succeeds in catching up with its rival by former effect on n we refer to as an namely that more competition induces firms to innovate in order to escape competition since the incremental value of getting ahead is increased with higher pmc on average an increase in product market competition will thus have an ambiguous effect on growth it induces faster productivity growth in currently sectors and slower growth in currently unleveled sectors the overall effect on growth will thus depend on the fraction of leveled versus unleveled sectors but this fraction is itself endogenous since it depends upon equilibrium intensities in both types of sectors we proceed to show under which condition this overall effect is an inverted u and at the same time derive additional predictions for further empirical respectively denote the probability being an unleveled respectively any unit time interval the probability that a sector moves from being unleveled to leveled is n h we have established by numerical simulation that all of our results hold with r and probability that it moves in the opposite direction is n in state these two probabilities must be equal n together with the fact that implies that the flow of innovations n n n now analyze how this flow varies with product market competition and establish the possibility of an pattern since by proposition n is an increasing function of we use n as our proximate measure of product market which in turn will prove convenient when deriving our main predictions below note that n takes values on the h h h h with x to maximum collusion and x to maximum competition we have whenever the value h is to the interval the aggregate innovation rate n an pattern it increases with competition n for all n and decreases for all n if then the aggregate innovation rate increases with n for n so that the effect always if then it decreases with n for all n so that the schumpeterian effect always each of these cases arises for a nonempty subset of parameter see appendix shape can be explained as follows when there is not much product market competition there is hardly any incentive for firms to innovate and therefore the overall innovation rate will be highest when the sector is unleveled thus the industry will be quick to leave the unleveled state which it does as soon as the laggard innovates and slow to leave the leveled state which will not happen until one of the firms as a result the industry will spend most of the time in the leveled state where the effect dominates decreasing in in if the degree of competition is very low to begin with an journal of in competition should result in a faster average innovation the other hand when competition is initially very high there is relatively little incentive for the laggard in an unleveled state to innovate thus the industry will be relatively slow to leave the unleveled state meanwhile the large incremental profit gives firms in the leveled state a relatively large to innovate so that the industry will be relatively quick to leave the leveled state as a result the industry will spend most of the time in the unleveled state where the schumpeterian effect is at work on the laggard while the leader never other words if the degree of competition is very high to begin with an increase in competition should result in a slower average innovation that according to this model the empirical measure c of competition that we used in the previous section has an expected value is in accordance with equation above the industry average lerner index in an uneven industry is since the has a lerner of zero whereas the industry average lerner index in a leveled industry is the lerner index of each firm equal to its profits divided by its revenue show in appendix that in our the empirical measure c defined by is a increasing function of the theoretical measure in the other additional predictions on technological spread and addition to providing a rationale for the pattern uncovered in the previous section the model delivers two additional predictions which are summarized in the following two propositions and which we prove in appendix thus the reason why the effect dominates when competition is low whereas the schumpeterian effect on laggards dominates when competition is intense is the of competition on the distribution of technology gaps across and the expected technological gap in an industry increases with product market intuition is simple we know that the higher the degree of product market competition the higher the research intensity in sectors and the lower the research intensity in unleveled sectors this in turn implies that any sector will spend a higher fraction of its time being unleveled so that on average over time the technological gap between firms in that sector will be higher by the law of large numbers the same will be true for the economy as a whole at any point in next proposition is equally intuitive it states the existence of a positive interaction between the effect and the average distance of the industry to its frontier in the sense that in industries where firms are closer to their technological frontier over time the effect tends to be stronger that is the increasing part of the inverted u tends to be more precisely suppose that there are industries with large spillover parameter h and industries with small with large h will tend to be more on average over time now we can compare the magnitude of the effect across industries with different values of h and establish the peak of the inverted u is larger and occurs at a higher degree of competition in more industries more formally let be the incremental profit at which x h then both and are increasing see appendix testing the technological spread predictions to empirically assess the predictions on the technological spread and competition relationship we first need a measure of the size of the technology gap between firms within an capture this by the proportional distance a firm is from the technological frontier as measured by total factor formally we this is formally established in appendix in the remark following the proof of proposition journal of f denotes the frontier firm with the highest tfp and i denotes nonfrontier firms so at the firm level m and we use an industry level measure m that is the across firms in the industry a lower value of mjt indicates that firms in industry j are technologically closer to the frontier and therefore more like the firms in our theoretical section while a high value of m indicates a technological gap with the frontier so that firms in those industries are more like laggard firms in an unleveled first key prediction on the technological spread is that in equilibrium the average technology gap between leaders and followers should be an increasing function of the overall level of industrywide competition so that average should be a decreasing function of this is tested and confirmed in table iii which reports the results from regressing the industry average technology gap on the lerner index with a full set of year dummies first column and a full set of year and industry dummies second in both cases there is a significantly positive coefficient suggesting that industries with greater levels of competition have a higher average spread in technology within the industry and a lower degree of technology result is perhaps surprising because the static intuition is that higher competition should reduce the spread of increasing the exit rate of low tfp firms truncating the lower tail of the distribution but empirically we find this static effect of competition appears to be dominated by a more dynamic effect to increase the rate of innovation as firms innovate to try to escape competition they increase the spread of tfp within the industry dominating any potential selective exit second theoretical prediction is that the relationship between competition and growth should be steeper in more industries to assess this prediction we consider a subsample of our with below median technological are the more industries figure iii shows our baseline fitted exponential quadratic curve as well as an exponential quadratic curve fitted to the subsample of high and gap and exponential quadratic with squared squared gap jt is measured by lerner index in the technology gap jt is measured by the average distance to the tfp frontier firm across all firms in the so it is an inverse measure of all columns estimated using an unbalanced panel of yearly observations on seventeen industries over the period to significance tests show likelihood ratio and from the of joint significance numbers in brackets are standard errors the standard errors in columns and have not been corrected for the inclusion of the control features stand out clearly first more industries show a higher level of innovation activity for any level of product market competition second the curve is steeper for the more industries which accords well with our theoretical predictions these differences are statistically significant as shown in columns and of table ii which reports the quadratic coefficients for the whole sample and the high industry subsample including a full set of year dummies third column and a full set of year and industry dummies fourth the interaction terms are jointly significant in both journal of and competition the split the figure plots a measure of competition on the against patents on the each point represents an the circles show the exponential quadratic curve that is reported in column of table i the triangles show the exponential quadratic curve estimated only on industries that is reported in column of table paper investigates the relationship between product market competition pmc and innovation using a flexible nonlinear estimator we find evidence that the relationship takes the form of an shape with industries distributed across both the increasing and decreasing sections of the this is robust to a number of alternative specifications including identifying the causal impact of competition by exploiting a series of major policy reforms in the united understand what is driving this shape we extend the current theoretical literature on innovation to produce a model that delivers an prediction in this model competition may increase the incremental profit from innovating labeled the but competition may also reduce innovation incentives for laggards labeled the the balance between these two and changes between low and high levels of competition generating an relationship in addition this extension of the theory provides two new predictions first the equilibrium degree of technological among firms should decrease with pmc and second the higher the average degree of in an industry the steeper the between pmc and innovation we take these two additional predictions to the data and find them to be consistent with the data this dual empirical and theoretical approach provides useful results on the impact of competition and closeness in technology space on innovation and also a model to understand this and experiment with potential policy of proposition solve for the equilibrium research intensities n and n and laggard firms we use bellman precisely let denote the steady of being currently a leader respectively a follower in an industry with technology gap m and let r denote the rate of time discount we have the following bellman equations v v v words the annuity value rv of currently being a leader in an industry with gap m at date t equals the current profit flow minus the expected capital loss n v v from having the follower catch up by one step with leader the annuity value of currently being a laggard equal to the current profit flow plus the expected capital h v v from catching up with the leader the cost finally in the bellman equation a firm there is no help factor h because there is no leader and denotes the intensity by the other firm it follows by the same argument as used in aghion et al that the equilibrium real wage rate will equal unity given our choice to normalize expenditures equal to journal of the same sector in a symmetric nash equilibrium both intensities are equal that using the fact that each firm chooses its own to maximize its current value that is to maximize the side of the corresponding bellman equation we obtain the the between the bellman equations and conditions to yield the reduced form n r n r h n n system is recursive as the first equation solves for n and given n the second equation solves for for the where r we use the relationship to obtain h n immediately see that whereas with higher product market competition this establishes proposition of proposition n from equation this and equation n and to equation b x h h we can reexpress the aggregate innovation rate as x b x b b x x decreasing in x with a unique value which f x therefore x is with x as x therefore the pattern will obtain whenever the effect will dominate if and the schumpeterian effect will always dominate if let one can easily establish that the pattern will obtain whenever effect will strictly dominate over the whole interval whenever the schumpeterian effect will dominate over the whole interval journal of of the corresponding three regions is nonempty which establishes proposition of proposition equations and we b b is defined in the proof of proposition above from this and b n n b b n n b n b from this and proposition n b n b n we need only show n n clearly holds when so suppose that then we need only show n n follows from equations and n b n n h n h n n h and n n implies condition of proposition that the expected technological gap is given by n n can be reexpressed n b n latter expression is clearly increasing in n and therefore product market competition this establishes proposition the expected technological n decreasing in h this stems from the fact that n is decreasing h whereas h is increasing in h to see the former note from equation n the latter follows from this and equation n h n h n n journal of of proposition h h will affect and via its positive effect on b assume that is interior to the interval from the envelope theorem the marginal effect of b max just equal to the direct x b x b is unambiguously positive the marginal effect of h is e h which is therefore also positive therefore more industries those with larger h have a higher peak in the inverted u moreover the peak occurs at the value of such that x n or equivalently h h peak lies farther to the right on the line in more industries if dh where is implicitly defined by applying the implicit functions theorem to we get h h dh this establishes proposition summary iv presents the descriptive statistics on our unbalanced panel spanning industries from to and weighted gap sample is an unbalanced panel of yearly observations on seventeen industries over the period to is taken from an underlying firm level panel of firms which remain after matching the accounting and innovation data and cleaning the data removing firms with missing observations firms involved in major mergers or firms with less than three years of consecutive data see bloom and van reenen for full the lerner and technology gap measures are generated from the entire population of u k firms from the data we can see even the industry level patenting count is highly skewed with most industries taking out no patents in any given levels also vary strongly across industries in part due to different patenting intensities although in estimation the industry dummies will control for this the lerner averages and ranges from percent

documentation applies only to the older apis that are in the google data apis directory for information about a new api see that documentation for information authorizing requests with a newer api see google authentication and applications often require limited access to a google account for certain types of activity to ensure that user is not abused all requests for access must be approved by the holder access control has two components authentication authentication services allow users to sign in to your using a google account some services also allow users to sign in another account such as an openid authorization services let users provide your application with to the data they have stored in google applications google privacy seriously and any application that requires access to a data must be authorized by the authentication and authorization services are often referred collectively as authentication and authorization for google apis allow applications to get limited access to a google accounts certain types of activities this document introduces the auth mechanisms and describes what each one provides for oauth is a new simplified authorization protocol for google apis oauth relies on ssl for security instead requiring your application to do cryptographic signing this protocol allows your application to request access to associated with a google oauth provides authorization for all google hybrid protocol provides both authentication and for web applications allowing users to log in and authorize to their data in a single step this protocol uses openid provide authentication services and oauth to provide to google openid authenticates users with their google accounts allows users to log in to your web site without having to sign for a new authsub and clientlogin are proprietary apis available as an alternative to oauth for most google apis possible you should avoid using these services if you already applications that use them you should migrate to the options described if your application is a gadget for use in igoogle or other containers see the section authentication for note this document is intended to provide an overview of authentication method for detailed information on each method see full google account authentication apis see also the google accounts api group for discussion on using google accounts oauth authorization for web and installed using oauth with web using oauth with installed using authsub for using clientlogin for authentication for authorization for web and installed many google services allow access to such as calendar or documents data as long as access is authorized the user this feature allows users to share and exchange data their google applications and applications for a variety google supports two versions of oauth for getting authorized access a google data oauth and oauth both offering access both web applications and installed for web and installed web applications or installed applications can use the new oauth protocol to authorize access to data associated with a account for details and examples of how to implement oauth google see our documentation on oauth for web web applications that need authorized access to data associated with google account or a google apps account can use of the oauth api for complete information about implementing oauth applications including examples see the oauth for apps guide or see the overview in this for installed applications installed on computers and mobile devices can oauth to authorize access to data associated with a google account complete information about implementing oauth for applications see the oauth for installed applications guide see the overview in this oauth with web all google data apis support oauth an open standard authorizing the use of data in web applications all web that make oauth requests must upload a security certificate register with google see registration for for more the google data apis client libraries provide methods to help use oauth in your web application specifically there are methods constructing the request token authorizing the request token exchanging the authorized request token for an access token libraries also handle the necessary signing algorithms when requests to a google data service for extensive examples of how to oauth with the google data api client using with the google data apis client oauth authorization the oauth authorization process involves a series of between your web application authorization servers and end at a basic level the process is as your application requests access and gets an unauthorized token from authorization google asks the user to grant you access to the required your application gets an authorized request token from authorization you exchange the authorized request token for an access you use the access token to request data from access when your application initially requests access to a google issues an unauthorized request token to your if the user is not already logged in google prompts the user to in google then displays an authorization page that allows the user see what google service data your application is requesting access if the user approves your access request google an authorized request token each request token is valid for only hour only an authorized request token can be exchanged for an token and this exchange can be done only once per authorized by default access tokens are each access token is to the user account specified in the original request authorization and grants access only to the services specified in request your application should store the access token because required for all access to a ready for before you can set up your application to use the google service with oauth you must complete the following whether to register your web to provide your users with additional assurances of the security their data you can choose to register your web application with and sign your requests with the registered security certificate google data api feeds are available to registered applications see the documentation for the google data api interested in determine if that api only works with registered your application must sign each oauth request it makes if you to use a signature to sign your requests you must upload security certificate as part of the registration alternatively you can use a signature to sign your no certificate is required for signatures instead generates an oauth consumer secret value which is displayed on registration page after you have for more information on the registration process see for web the scope of the data your application will each google service sets limits on the access it allows through google data apis this access is expressed as a scope value services provide a variety of scope values to allow a user to which applications should have access to which data for about the available scope values for the google service you want access see the documentation for that in general you should request a token for the narrowest scope includes the data you need for example if your application access to the all calendars feed you should request a for the httpaddr up a mechanism to manage oauth when you obtain an oauth access token for a data you must that access token for all future interactions with the specified service on behalf of the your application should manage token storage securely tracking the google service for which each token is valid if require access to more than one google service you can obtain access tokens but no more than ten access tokens per user application can be outstanding at any if your application supports multiple user accounts you must track of which account each token is associated with each oauth is specific to the user who authorized access your application must able to associate a token with the correct user one way to manage is to issue a cookie to the user before making the token request the user grants access to the requested data google sends authorized request token and redirects the user to your you can then use your cookie to associate the token the correct up a mechanism to request access to a google each request to a google service must be signed and must include valid oauth access token in general each request is made in the of a httpaddr get request with the access token and signature included the header requests that write new data should use httpaddr for more information on the proper request format for each data api refer to the documentation for that openid if implementing openid for user authentication consider the hybrid protocol to combine the two processes the tasks of getting a request token and it are handled as part of the openid request with oauth extensions with oauthgetrequesttoken these extensions are used to identify google services to be accessed a successful response to the request contains an authorized request token once this token received use oauthgetaccesstoken to exchange it for an access with oauth to use oauth your application must generate signed request calls and handle the responses for the following get an unauthorized request token authorize the request token exchange the authorized request token for an access all oauth requests must be signed whether or not your application registered for further information see signing oauth you can experiment with requesting and receiving authorization in the oauth for detailed documentation see the oauth api a callback you can specify a value for in an request to determine where google redirects the user after authorize your access request the callback url can include parameters the redirect will include the same query parameters well as the authorized request token which your application must able to for example when supporting multiple languages you can include query parameter that identifies the version of the application that user is viewing an value httpaddr would result in httpaddr parsing the token and the language parameter ensures that the user redirected back to the correct version of the if the parameter is not included google will direct user to a web page that displays a verification number example after authorizing your access request the user must return to your application and enter the verification number before can obtain an authorized request your application to google normally displays the name of an application when access consent from the user see if your application is not registered use the parameter in your oauthgetrequesttoken request to specify the name your application if that parameter is not specified google the domain name of the url provided by the parameter no callback url is provided google displays the string do not set this parameter if your application is registered default google shows the display name specified during if you set a display name in your oauthgetrequesttoken request will use this instead of your registered display name and will a message that the identity

authorize your access request this url must provided as the parameter of the request and as the verifier parameter of the to improve the user experience your application should attempt automatically detect when the user is redirected to this url immediately bring itself to the foreground and make oauthgetaccesstoken request to complete the oauth for more information and best practices see if your application cannot automatically detect when the user redirected to the callback url or cannot bring itself to foreground the callback url should display a page that explains how bring your application to the foreground and how to initiate oauthgetaccesstoken request from within your if your application cannot launch a full web browser it is possible for devices to authorize without a this mode allows a developer to set up a website where a user authorize the request for access after authorization the user given a code generated by google and redirected to the site this site should explain to the user how to input the code their device to complete the authorization this mode is recommended for use during the early development of application as in the autodetect mode your application must launch a browser the user must authorize your request however instead of creating webpage for the callback url you can set the value of parameter to oob out of in that case after the user authorizes your request google the user to a google accounts page that displays a verification see the user must return to your application and enter the number before you can make a

keys and oauth back to authsub for authsub is a google proprietary authorization api available as alternative to oauth for most google apis you should avoid authsub if possible if you already have applications that use you should migrate to oauth or the hybrid authsub authorization authorization with authsub involves a sequence of interactions three entities the web application google services and the this diagram illustrates the authorization when the web application needs to access a google it makes an authsub call to authorization proxy the authorization service responds by serving up an access page this page prompts the user to access to their google service the user may first be asked to into their the user decides whether to grant or deny access to the application if the user denies access they are directed to google page rather than back to the web if the user grants access the authorization service redirects user back to the web application the redirect contains authorization token good for one use it can be exchanged for the web application contacts the google service with a using the authorization token to act as an agent for the if the google service recognizes the token it supplies requested with incorporating authsub into your web application requires these decide whether or not to register your web registered web applications have the advantage of being by google the standard caveat displayed to users on the login page is modified or omitted in addition registered applications are identified with a descriptive name rather merely the calling url keep in mind that some google allow only limited access to unregistered web applications if choose to register use this automated registration if you register you can also provide a security certificate keys registered web applications with a certificate on file able to acquire secure tokens for use when requesting data from google service they can also use tokens if decide what type of tokens to use and how to manage an authorization token received from google is intended to be for all future interactions with the specified google service that user the type of token you choose to on the type of interactions your web will have with a google service for example a may be sufficient if the interaction is a or rare if you choose to get session tokens and use them regularly access the google service your web application will need to token storage including tracking the user and google service token is valid for google accounts is not set up to manage numbers of tokens and in fact does not allow more than ten tokens per user per web application to be outstanding at any time this limitation allows a web application to get tokens to cover different services if necessary it does support getting a new token each time the web application needs access a google service if you decide to store session tokens tokens should be treated as securely as any other information stored on the alternatively you can choose to get fresh tokens on a basis as long as you set up a token revocation mechanism application would need to revoke the existing token requesting another in this scenario the user would be required log in and grant access each time a new token is determine the scope required by the google service to be each google service determines how much and what type of access will allow this access is expressed as a scope value a scope may be a simple url identifying the entire service or it specify more restricted access some services severely access such as allowing access to limited to get the allowed scopes for the google service you want access refer to the documentation for that service you request the most tightly scoped token possible for example attempting to access atom feed feature use the httpaddr httpaddr google services are much restrictive with set up a mechanism to request and receive an authorization the mechanism must generate a authsubrequest including specifying the appropriate next and scope url determined in step if you are using secure tokens managing session tokens the request must include values for variables as the next url can include query parameters for example supporting multiple languages include a query parameter identifies the version of the web application the user is a next value of httpaddr result in the httpaddr parsing the token and the lang parameter ensures that the user redirected back to the correct version of the in certain circumstances using the hd parameter can streamline your experience when they are asked to access on the google accounts site in most cases the process is simple matter of logging into their account and choosing whether not to grant access users who have more than one google account regular gmail account one or more google apps accounts however may need to follow the extra universal process to to identify which account they wish to have accessed your application is designed for one particular managed domain can eliminate these extra steps by using this parameter to that domain you can also use the hd parameter if your accesses services that are not available on the value to will limit to regular accounts only when the hd value is set google automatically select the correct account for the token mechanism must be equipped to parse the redirect from google which contains the token and take with it because authorization tokens are specific to a user application must be able to associate a token with its user preferred option is to issue a cookie to the user before making token request then when google redirects the user back to site with an appended token your application can read the and associate the token with the correct user set up mechanisms to request session tokens and store or them if depending on what token management decisions you made in step you may need to create mechanisms to get and revoke session authsubsessiontoken and to session and revocation mechanisms use authsubtokeninfo indicates whether a given token is valid or not if storing the application must track both the user id and the service covered by the set up a mechanism to request access to a google refer to documentation for the google service for information the proper request format all requests to a google service include a valid authorization token in general a request to google service is in the form of an httpaddr get or post if new data with the token referenced in the request the request header should take the following authsub where token is the authorization token or received from google in response to an authsub request if token is secure it must be accompanied by a digital signature signing requests for instructions and the example below illustrates a request header for a call to google calendar feed service this request contains a httpaddr httpaddr authsub httpaddr information about for information on authsub including registering your application google and a detailed explanation of exchanging a token for session token see these additional authsub authentication for web applications using authsub with the google data apis client generating keys and certificates secure signing requests with authsub secure registration for back to clientlogin for clientlogin is a google proprietary authorization api available as alternative to oauth for most google apis you should avoid clientlogin if possible if you already have applications that clientlogin you should migrate to oauth or the hybrid for installed applications clientlogin allows your users to log into their google account inside your application the application then contacts google with login data and requests access to a specified google data api once login information has been successfully authenticated google returns token which your application will reference each time it access to the account such as to get or post data the remains valid for a set length of time defined by whichever service working note the google data apis client libraries provide methods help you use clientlogin in your installed applications there are methods for acquiring an authentication token captcha challenges recalling the auth token for later use and the correct authorization header with every request if you are with one of the libraries see using clientlogin with the data apis client clientlogin authorization authorization with clientlogin involves a sequence of between three entities the installed application google services the user this diagram illustrates the authorization when the application needs to access a service it retrieves the login name and the application then makes a clientlogin call authorization if the google authorization service decides additional vetting necessary it returns failure response with a captcha token challenge in the form of a url for a captcha if a captcha challenge is received the displays the captcha image for the user and solicits an answer the if requested the user submits an answer to the captcha the application makes a new clientlogin call this including the captcha answer and token received with the on a successful login attempt with or without captcha the google authorization service returns a token to the application contacts the google service with a request for access referencing the token received from the authorization if the google service recognizes the token it supplies requested data use this interface in your installed application to access a google account after collecting login information the user call clientlogin to request access to the once the login information has been successfully authenticated returns a token which your application will reference each time requests access to the account the token remains valid for set length of time which is defined by whichever google service working incorporating clientlogin into your application requires these create a ui element to capture login data from the the ui needs to solicit a user name email address domain and password the ui should also be capable of displaying captcha image using the url received from google if one required and soliciting a correct answer from the user your ui will include a link to google accounts login httpaddr in the event that user needs to sign up for a new account or do other write code to generate a httpaddr post clientlogin and transmit this code needs to contain logic to handle a captcha challenge include both the logintoken and logincaptcha parameters application should also be able to detect when the user required repeats incorrect data after a display an error without sending a handle responses from there are four possible responses to a login success an httpaddr failure an httpaddr with an explanatory error invalid request generally resulting from a malformed failure with a captcha a success response contains an authorization token labeled this token must be included in all subsequent requests to google service for this account authorization tokens should closely guarded and should not be given to any other as they represent access to the account the time limit the token varies depending on which service issued a failure response includes one or more error codes and a url the error message that can be displayed for the user please that clientlogin does not differentiate between a failure due to incorrect password or one due to an unrecognized user name example if the user has not yet signed up for an application needs to handle all possible error messages a failure response with a captcha challenge means that google decided for whatever reason that additional security should be taken this response is accompanied by a captcha url and a token representing the specific captcha handle a captcha challenge from to handle the challenge the application must display the image and solicit an answer from the user to display the image use the value of captchaurl returned with the response prefixing it with the google accounts httpaddr once the user provides answer the application should resend the login request this including the captcha token logintoken and the google validates the answer authorizing access to the there is an alternative for developers who do not want to the of getting and transmitting a user captcha in response to a captcha challenge the application can direct user to the google hosted httpaddr once user has successfully responded to the challenge the google trusts the computer in use the application can then resend original login request to obtain the authorization note google does not validate the login attempt prior to issuing captcha challenge this means a login attempt could fail even a captcha captcha is a trademark of carnegie mellon back to for if building a gadget using the standard gadgets api can leverage a feature of the gadget platform called the oauth proxy access the google data apis oauth described above is authentication standard that allows users to access their private in a gadget hosting service such as igoogle myspace or orkut share their data with another website or gadget the oauth proxy designed to make development easier for gadget developers by many of authentication details the proxy is based on project called shindig which is an implementation the gadget note the oauth proxy is only supported for gadgets that use gadgets api and run in opensocial containers it is not supported the legacy gadgets your gadget must obtain an oauth token before it can access a data the oauth proxy manages the authentication flow for you first time a user installs your gadget the following process your gadget loads for the first time and attempts to access data using one of the google data the request fails because the user granted access response object contains a url in responseoauthapprovalurl the oauth approval page your gadget should provide a method launch a new window with that on the approval page the user chooses to grant or deny access your gadget if successful the user is taken to the page you specify for the best user experience httpaddr next the user closes the popup window to notify your gadget the user has approved you can use a popup handler to the approval window closing alternatively your gadget can a link eg approved access for the user to click this window your gadget attempts to access the google data api a second time the data this attempt is your gadget is authenticated and can begin operating to access one or more of the google data apis you first need to your gadget to use oauth as the authentication method add an element in the moduleprefs section of your service access httpaddr request httpaddr httpaddr authorization httpaddr httpaddr in this section only change the following query a required parameter in the request url your gadget can data from the used in this parameter in this the gadget can access blogger and calendar data a gadget request data for a single scope or multiple scopes as example an optional parameter in the authorization url the approval page redirects to this url after the user has access to data you should set this parameter httpaddr to provide best user experience when users install your gadget that provides a snippet of javascript that automatically closes popup window alternatively you can set this parameter to to your own approved page or you can simply leave parameter an authenticated google data api once your gadget has authenticated the user accessing a google api is straightforward with the google data apis javascript library for information on how to use the library in the oauth see using the javascript client information about for complete information on creating google data api gadgets details on the oauth proxy an article on how to get started and gadgets spec see these additional using the javascript

improvements to roads and a sample visualization topic could be to examine through visualization the impacts of one or more of the above sources improving the safety measure of rates of fatalities per vehicle miles traveled between and the data visualization topic could also focus on local issues example drawing from local data sources how have improvements on intersection corridor or bus route

for periods while awaiting gates or runways since that rule went effect the number of incidents of excessive tarmac time has a possible side effect of the rule has been an increase in cancellations resulting in individuals potentially being an investment example of possible unintended consequences of is the case where a new runway added at a runway airport may anticipated to add percent to the overall airport capacity but to added operational complexity a lower level of capacity is there is a broad range of aviation data available for application data visualization in addition to the above

submission contribute to a potential policy investment issue in transportation safety or demonstrated value in assisting decision does the information presented in the data visualization and summary shed new light on a transportation issue otherwise would not have been to are two basic steps for create an interesting data visualization product and summary select a topic that addresses the goal areas of safety economic development and create an interesting data product that demonstrates support to decision makers for topic the data visualization product should clearly display insight in

architecture and a code jochen hartmann google data apis updated october originally written by daniel installing on on mac os on installing the google data client checking to make sure that you can access the client running the php installation running the where to learn appendix a editing your php path in your phpini appendix b using php from the command appendix c hints and revision the google data php client library is a powerful collection of that allow you to interact with the google data apis unlike other client libraries it is packaged as part of the popular framework but can also be downloaded separately similar to our client libraries it is also and designed to be simple efficient allowing you to get started on your projects php may already be installed on your development machine or so the first step is to verify that fact and to make sure that version of php is recent enough to be used for the client library easiest way to check is to place a new file into a directory on your server type the following information into the phpinfo then make sure that it is accessible from the web by setting appropriate permissions and navigate to its location from within browser if php is installed and your server is able to render pages then you should see something similar to the screenshot php info page the screenshot shows the php info page this page shows you the of php that has been installed in this case along with extensions have been enabled in the section the location of internal configuration file in the configuration if the page is not displayed or if version of php is older than you will need to install or your version of php otherwise you can skip the next section continue to installing the php client note if you have access to the command line and are planning to php to run command line scripts please see the command line section of this installation varies a bit by platform so it is important to follow instructions for your specific platform during installation before dive in it is worth pointing out that packages that include the apache web server and the mysql database along with have gained in popularity for windows mac os x and linux there the xampp project mac os x users also have the choice of using mamp project both of these packages support openssl in which is required for interacting with authenticated if you install php using the steps that follow below make sure you also install and enable support for openssl more details that can be found in the openssl section of the php site following sections are focused on how to install php by the easiest way to install or upgrade php on windows is with the installer available on the php downloads choose the php installer option in the windows binaries corresponding to the newest version of php and allow it open the installer and follow the installation when the wizard prompts you choose the web server that installed on your system so that it configures the server to with check your installation by following the steps outlined in section mac os php for os x is available as several binary packages on the mac os installation page you should choose one of the packages if it meets your needs instructions for installation vary depending on the one way to install or upgrade php on mac os x is with the package which includes support for most of the commonly download the appropriate for your version of apache package the entropy decompress the downloaded file by on open the installer and follow its check your installation by following the steps outlined in section depending on the linux distribution there may be a or easy use setup option for php installation for example on ubuntu you either use a package manager or just type the following on in install if there a packaged install available with your distribution you must install from source code there are instructions for compiling php for apache and compiling for apache phpnet also has instructions for other the google data php client now that you have a working version of php installed time install the client library the client library is part of zend framework but can also be downloaded as standalone version if you already have a version of the framework installed version or higher you can skip because the google data client library is included however sure you are using the latest version of the framework will that you have all the newest features and bug fixes available to so it is usually downloading the complete framework will give you access to not just google data client library but also the rest of the framework client library itself uses a few other classes that are part of complete zend framework but there is no need to download the framework as we have bundled them into the standalone download the google data client library decompress the downloaded files four should demos sample documentation documentation for the client library library the actual client library source tests files for automated add the location of the library folder to your php path see next to make sure that you can access the client library the last step is to make sure that you can reference and include php client library files from the directory that you are building project this is accomplished by setting the variable configuration file the variable a number of directory location that php looks into when you issue require or include statement that pulls external classes libraries files into your current script similar to the import statement java you need to append the location of the client library files what has already been set in your this can accomplished in two ways both of which are explained in detail permanently set the directive in your configuration file from the command line requires shell and write set the path variable on a per directory level requires the apache web server and the ability to create use the function to dynamically set include path in your scripts can be set dynamically in each your php if you have shell access and write permissions to the phpini file if you are writing code on your local machine simply follow instructions in appendix a if you are using the apache web and have the ability to create htaccess files then you can set variable on a per directory level which means that of the files in the directory that you are working in are able to reference the client library you can specify php configuration options as shown in the this works for php in both apache versions and note refer to the php manual for more information about configuration if you have shell access to your server and modify create htaccess files that you can always use the function note that you may already have some value set for so it may be a good idea to follow the model below append the new values instead of overwriting the entire note please refer to the php manual pages for more details on the php installation to verify that your include path has been set properly you can run php installation checker script simply copy and paste the of that file into a new file in a directory on server and navigate to it from your browser if you see output to the below then everything has been configured properly and you ready to use the php client php installation checker output if you see errors as in the screenshot below make sure you the direction you may be missing extensions or your path may still be set correctly remember that you may need to restart your server the changes to take effect this only applies if you are modifying the phpini file the screenshot below shows that is set to php installation checker output note please note that the php installation checker checks following in succession are the required php extensions does the point to the directory of the php library can ssl connections be made and lastly can a be made to the youtube data api if a specific test fails remaining tests will not be now that the client library is installed time to try running the at the root of the directory is a folder of demos to help you get started some of these samples are designed to be from the such as and you can execute with php the remaining samples can be run from the and a web browser if you would like to view them in browser these should be placed in whatever directory you would use serve web pages these samples should give a basic idea of how to and run a google data application but when ready for there are other resources for the inquisitive note if you are interested in seeing the demos please visit httpaddr and look for the to learn the best places to look for information on the classes that are part the client library is the api reference guide on the zend site make sure to select the package from the at this point you should be all set to start coding so go on some great applications we look forward to seeing your you can find php developer guides for the following google google documents picasa web google youtube data since the php client library is an project support more apis is continually being added each service has own group please see our faq entry for a listing of available if you need help troubleshooting your api calls there are available on debugging api requests using network traffic tools and on using proxy servers with the google data apis are also a few external articles available on installing xampp linux and on installing xampp on windows in addition to all these articles be sure to check out the posts about the php library on the google data api tips a editing your php path in your phpini configuration the php path is variable that contains a list of locations that searches when it looks for additional libraries during loading order for php to be able to load and access the google data php library files on your machine or server they will need to be put a location that php knows about or alternatively the location of files needs to be appended to your php path note that changes to phpini file typically require a restart of your server you can verify the current value of the variable by navigating the php info page discussed earlier look for the configuration file cell in the first table and find the path in column to the note if you find that you are using php from the command line you need to modify an additional path variable make sure to appendix b using php from the once found the phpini file follow these steps to append to open the phpini file in your favorite text locate the line referencing the php path it should begin append the path you stored the zend framework to the list locations already present your new path with designated separator for your os on systems a correct path on systems would look like on windows it would look something like save and close the note on mac os x the finder does not allow access to files that in system locations such as the directory therefore it may easiest to edit them using a command line editor such as vi or pico do so use a command such as pico b using php from the as of php version there is a utility available in which is referred to as cli for line using utility allows for php scripts to be run from the command line situations in which this may be useful is if you are running locally on your machine and are looking for ways to quickly test scripts on your server of course this will require shell access important thing to note is that php typically uses two separate files one contains the configuration options for php running on server and another for the configurations that php uses when from the command line if you are interested in running demo applications from the client library you will to modify the phpini file as to locate it type the following commands on systems mac x linux and i grep that command should result in the following information being in your file phpini path configuration file note of course the actual path locations may differ your c hints and this section contains a brief outline of some of the issue developers have discovered when working with php and the with the extension in the php client library uses the domdocument classes to transform requests and responses into php objects the extension cause problems with xml handling and result in transformations some of our developers have found that when xampp the domdocument constructor gets overriden with an function call as explained on the php site to fix this make sure that xml handling is not overwritten in your phpini make sure to remove references to from configuration are timing out when using the client if you are using the client library to perform fairly large such as uploading videos to the youtube data api you may need change the timeout parameter in your httpaddr class can be done easily by passing a parameter during which sets the timeout value to something other than the assuming your httpaddr already exists as httpaddr and that you want to change the timeout from the second default to httpaddr hosting providers do not allow httpaddr connections to be made from we have heard that some hosting providers do not allow you to httpaddr connections from their default servers if you get an message similar to the below you may need to make your httpaddr connections through a secure to connect to httpaddr error connection timed your hosting provider should have information on the actual address the proxy server to use the below snippet demonstrates how a proxy configuration can be used with the php client load the proxy adapter class in addition to the other required httpaddr configure the proxy connection with your hostname and httpaddr a simple httpaddr request would be an attempt to authenticate via httpaddr new httpaddr httpaddr the service name would depend on what api you are interacting with we are using the google documentslist data try to perform the clientlogin authentication using our proxy if there is an error we exit since it make sense to go note that we are creating another httpaddr by passing our proxied client into the httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr catch httpaddr httpaddr you may want to handle this differently in your error occurred trying to connect to the proxy httpaddr updated by jochen hartmann this update contains the following made php configuration for web servers clearer by moving that refer to php into an added note about multiple phpini configuration added sections on how to dynamically set the

to be to provide a consistent set of information about a particular kind for example various google data api or gdata services provide contact information for a person or an organization it sense for all such services to use the same set of the collection of elements that together describe a contact is the contact kind some of the elements in the contact kind ordinary atom or rss elements others are defined by google in namespace called the google data namespace by convention the data namespace is usually referred to in xml code using the gd for example the element that contains a telephone or fax number the schema url for the google data namespace httpaddr google defines other kinds as well event a collection of elements that together represent a calendar event and message collection of elements representing an email message discussion posting or other some elements from the google data namespace are used by kinds for example the element associates a person in the with the entry that contains the this element is used in the event kind to specify attendees and so on also used in the message kind to senders and when an entry in a google data api feed uses a given kind it an element with its scheme attribute set httpaddr and its term attribute set the name of the schema url followed by the name of the kind example a contact entry includes the following httpaddr httpaddr this allows clients to quickly and easily determine what kind of the entry is to determine the semantics of the you can use rss instead of atom if you prefer see the reference document for the rss elements corresponding to this document is a reference for some common kinds and the they we include information about the standard elements in kinds where those elements have their meanings for example and all have their standard meanings when they appear in we also include information about standard atom elements would be meaningless in the given context for example used in the contact kind and although is required element in an entry unless specified in the feed it have a useful meaning in the contact it may be hard to figure out exactly what information you need include when creating an entry of a particular kind especially some elements in the kinds contain other one approach that might help is to use the client libraries we rather than to try to construct kinds by hand the client provide various methods for adding and changing data in an entry of given kind see the client library documentation for the information in this document cover all possible and attribute values for kinds services may extend kinds so particular service may use properties and values not included in in the tables in this document we use the following conventions required and optional elementname

imported events contain exrule or exdate properties calendar will provide those properties when it sends a note the the use of means that you sure just from examining a element whether there any exceptions to the recurrence description to ensure that you all exceptions look for elements in the and use their elements to match them up property type text recurrence a recurring event that takes place every morning from to am pacific time from march through march element represents an event an exception to a recurring an instance of a recurring event in which one or more aspects of recurring event such as attendance list time or location have contains a element that specifies the recurring event that this event is an exception when you change an instance of a recurring event that instance an exception depending on what change you made to it the behaves in either of two different ways when the original event is if you add change or remove comments attendees or responses then the exception remains tied to the original and changes to the original event also change the if you make any other changes to the exception such as the time or location then the instance becomes which means that no longer as tightly tied to the event if you change the original event specialized change but see for example say you have a meeting every tuesday and thursday at pm if you change the attendance list for this meeting not for the regularly scheduled meeting then it becomes an if you change the time for this meeting but not for regularly scheduled meeting then it becomes regardless of whether an exception is specialized or not if you something that deletes the instance that the exception was from then the exception is deleted note that changing the day or of a recurring event deletes all instances and creates new for example after specialized this meeting say change the recurring meeting to happen on monday wednesday friday that change deletes all of the recurring

authenticating to a google data using retrieving feeds and updating creating deleting uploading media other at heart google data apis use atom feeds and entries xml as data format and httpaddr as a protocol for data transmission the atom publishing protocol we publish a number of libraries to make interacting with google data apis easier always welcome to use tools to work with services and pretty easy to do with a little curl is a application for performing requests using variety of protocols including httpaddr curl is often used by to test google data services as it supports the httpaddr required to interact with the apis at a low curl only provides support for performing the httpaddr communication knowledge of the google data protocol the protocol and the xml data format used is a prerequesite for with the application some other tools are mentioned in this for making these tasks this article uses examples based upon the picasa web albums api however all these examples can be readily applied to google data and installing curl is commonly available on a default install of many platforms try typing curl in your favorite shell to see if the tool installed and is in your path if you have the tool visit the download page on the curl website to obtain official source or a binary package note that tool uses the libcurl library which may be offered as separate download package so if not compiling from the be sure to download a package instead of a the packages are required if you wish to use curl acquire authentication tokens or to access some google services which require using ssl for to a google data authenticated google data requests are performed by adding an httpaddr header to the request which contains either a apps or authsub web apps authentication for the purposes of testing using curl clientlogin is the method and is documented below authsub authentication headers could used with curl but the process of obtaining the is out of scope for this clientlogin is intended for installed with this method of authentication the application using google apis directly handles the username and password of the an authentication request for clientlogin takes a password and service name as form post variables these variables passed as the email passwd and service arguments respectively request yields a response with several tokens one of which can be to make requests to the google data service note that data passed with curl must be if they contain characters which often appear in email and passwd arguments you ask curl to these arguments by using the example httpaddr httpaddr example please see the clientlogin documentation for specific information the parameters used in the above request in this example service using is the picasa web albums data api the service service is the service names for other google data services be found in the google data apis faq the value of the auth token in the above response is the only needed for authentication to google data services the value of token is formed into an httpaddr header which is then used for each to a google data authorization googlelogin httpaddr note the method of escaping newline characters with characters above does not work in the windows command shell you must enter the entire command on one line if running curl feeds and in google data apis retrieving feeds and entries is done by an httpaddr get on a url with an optional set of query parameters we are performing a get request only the auth header and the url required to be passed to curl the example below will continue the picasa web albums data api and is used to retrieve a list albums owned by the authenticated user note that we have shortened auth token to abcdefg in this example but the full token from above should be used in its authorization googlelogin httpaddr this will return an unformatted blob of httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr there are some decent tools for formatting this output to make it including tidy the easiest way to use tidy is pipe the output from the curl command to tidy like the authorization googlelogin httpaddr tidy xml indent this results in a much more readable feed like the httpaddr httpaddr category httpaddr httpaddr title subtitle httpaddr link httpaddr httpaddr link httpaddr link httpaddr httpaddr generator httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr category httpaddr httpaddr title to summary was the recent trip i took rights link httpaddr httpaddr link httpaddr link httpaddr link httpaddr httpaddr individual entries can be retrieved in the same way by providing url for the entry as opposed to a feed entries in google data apis are updated by doing an httpaddr put to edit url with a new copy of the xml in the body of the retrieve the entry using the url update the entry locally to make the needed put the entry back to the server using the url retrieving the the entry can be retrieved using one of the two urls bolded in the block above the url needed is the href value for the link element a authorization googlelogin httpaddr updating the entry after you retrieve the entry the entry needs to be updated using local text editor or application to make any needed changes to entry in the command above to retrieve an entry we did not pipe results to tidy as we have done in the previous examples the result xml that represents the same data but has different formatting the version piped to tidy for the purposes of hand editing an using tidy can often make working with the xml note please remember to include all xml namespace definitions are used as attributes to the when you post your new omitting these will cause parsing exceptions also tidy will the spaces between the namespace definitions with newline while this is valid xml google data services do not accept it at time if you are using tidy please be sure to add additional between these attributes on the entry updating the entry on the using the edit url you need to put a copy of the entry to the using curl a header to indicate the type of content being sent to server needs to be added the following snippet assumes that the with the updated entry is saved in put authorization googlelogin httpaddr entries in google data apis are created by doing an httpaddr post to post url with a new entry the is assigned by the server thus not necessary to include in new entries the easiest way to a new entry is to take an old entry and modify it the example will do just retrieve a template entry using the modify the template entry locally to remove unnecessary and make the needed post the entry back to the server using the post url for the this is either found in the retrieved feed as the href value the link element with httpaddr or in documentation for the service on httpaddr retrieve a template a single entry can be retrieved using the href value of a link with a in the same way as an entry was retrieved updating it in the above authorization googlelogin httpaddr xml indent quiet the response after using tidy will look something httpaddr httpaddr category httpaddr httpaddr title to summary was the recent trip i took rights link httpaddr httpaddr link httpaddr link httpaddr link httpaddr httpaddr to was the recent trip i to httpaddr httpaddr modify the template we want to create an album called curling in canada with from our recent curling match google data allows you to drop elements that the server supplies values for so to create this template entry remove the and the various elements in the feed this give us a template entry the entry then needs to modified to represent the new album we are httpaddr category httpaddr httpaddr title in summary of all my curling matches in note please remember to include all xml namespace definitions are used as attributes to the when you post your new omitting these will cause parsing exceptions also tidy will the spaces between the namespace definitions and replace them newline characters while this is valid xml google data services not accept it at this time if you are using tidy please be sure add additional spaces between these attributes on the entry posting the new entry to the the curl command for posting a new entry to the server is very to updating an existing entry except that the url is post authorization googlelogin httpaddr tidy xml if the post was successful the resulting xml output is a copy of entry this entry will include things which the generated at the time the entry was created including the values the and elements resulting link values can be used to edit or delete the entry no additional changes are made in the deleting entries is very similar to updating entries except an httpaddr delete method is used instead of an httpaddr put and no data is required be sent also like the update request the edit url is used as target of the httpaddr delete authorization googlelogin httpaddr media an important feature of the picasa web albums data api and documents list data api is the ability to upload binary objects can easily accomplish uploading binary data and a slug header the documents list data api currently requires posting the xml with the binary data as a mime multipart message forming the message is out of scope for this the example below shows how to upload a picture to a picasa web album with the title the post sweeping the rock googlelogin httpaddr tidy xml indent some developers prefer learning or debugging using other popular tools telnet openssl are used for making raw socket connections text and respectively to web servers and can be used interact with google data services note that not all google services may support ssl how you open up the telnet httpaddr picasa web albums data openssl connect httpaddr google data api and other services on httpaddr after the connection is made a raw httpaddr request must be sent request includes the httpaddr verb relative path version all and the body of the request an httpaddr httpaddr googlelogin httpaddr category httpaddr httpaddr title in summary of all my curling matches in when sending raw httpaddr data be aware that the post and operations will require computing the value for a header you can use the unix tool wc to compute this value all the content of the httpaddr body into a text file such example used above and run wc it is often difficult to debug if accidentally use an incorrect value for the wget is typically used to download data from a web server to local file however wget has lots of options which make it of performing all the different types of requests needed interact with google data services an example of how use wget to post a new album entry to picasa web authorization googlelogin httpaddr xsltproc is a tool to apply xsl transformations xslt to documents it can be used to easily extract desired bits of from an xml entry or feed returned by google data apis or generate new or updated as seen curl

documentation example if working with calendar read the calendar api data model tutorial and building and running your requesting a inserting a new requesting a specific searching querying by updating an deleting an this document is intended for java programmers who want to write applications that can interact with gdata this document assumes that you understand the general ideas behind google data apis protocol it also assumes that you know how program in for reference information about the classes and methods provided by client library see the java client library api reference javadoc this document is designed to be read in order each example builds earlier model the java client library uses a set of classes to represent the used by the google data apis for example a feed class corresponds to the element it has methods for creating entry getting and setting the values of various and on also an entry class which corresponds to the element not every element defined in the google data apis has its class for details see the reference the library can automatically parse atom content and put the values the atom elements into appropriate objects for example the method gets a feed parses it and returns a feed object with resulting to send a feed or entry to a service you create a feed or object then call a library method such as the insert method automatically translate the object into xml and send you can parse generate xml yourself if you prefer the way to do that is with an appropriate library such just as the google data xml syntax is extensible corresponding object model is extensible for example the library provides classes corresponding to the elements defined in google data and the following examples show how to send various data api requests the java client to make them more concrete these examples show how to interact with specific service google calendar point out places calendar differs from other google services to help you adapt examples for use with other services for more information calendar see the google calendar data api and running your to compile the examples in this document need to use following import a as described in the

details you can instead use special default url for interacting with calendar as described in calendar document but in this document use the private feed url which contains the user you also have to provide appropriate authentication the differences between this example and the first example in the document are that this example includes authentication and this example uses the more general googleservice class rather than calendarservice note that the authentication system using here known as authentication for installed applications is appropriate only for in installed client applications such as desktop clients not for in web applications for more information about authentication see google account authentication to request a calendar feed using the java client library for a with email address httpaddr and password mypassword use following set up the url and the object that will handle the feedurl new httpaddr myservice new httpaddr mark the feed as an event send the request and receive the myfeed the googleservice class represents a client connection authentication to a gdata service the general procedure for sending query to a service using the client library consists of the obtain or construct the appropriate if sending data to a service for example if inserting a new entry then transform the raw data into using the client library classes this step apply just requesting a feed as doing in this create a new googleservice instance setting the service name as cl for calendar and your name in the set the appropriate indicate to the client library what extensions the feed will so that the library can parse returned feeds call a method to send the request and receive any the setusercredentials method specifies the id and password of user on whose behalf your client is sending the query the examples this document use the authentication for installed authentication system for more information about systems see the google account authentication after setting credentials you indicate which extensions the feed use by calling the declareextensions method in this case saying that the feed is an event feed and thus that it will use extensions defined by the event to request an entire feed you call the getfeed method which a url and returns the entire feed found at that url show how send more specific queries later in this like other methods of the googleservice class getfeed authentication and redirects as a new to create a new calendar event you might use the following posturl new httpaddr myentry new with for a quick author new bennet null httpaddr starttime endtime eventtimes new send the request and receive the insertedentry after setting the url we construct an evententry evententry is derived from the abstract base class baseentry is also the parent class for the entry class which represents the evententry class represents an event kind for more see the kinds document for services other than calendar you assign the returned entry to an entry object rather than an the entry title is a textconstruct a class that holds text various forms plain text html or the entry content represented by a content object a class that can hold either text or other forms of content including xml and binary data but setcontent method can also accept a each author is represented as a name a uri and an email address this example leaving out the uri you add an author to an by calling the using the same googleservice object that we created in previous example in this case the method to call is insert sends an item to the specified insertion the service returns the newly created entry which may additional elements such as an edit url for httpaddr status codes are returned as the above code is equivalent to sending httpaddr proper authentication and providing an entry in the form of an a specific the following code lets you request the specific entry that inserted in the previous in the context of this series of examples retrieving that entry really necessary because calendar already returned the inserted but the same technique can be applied whenever you know the uri for entryurl new retrievedentry the inserted entry has a method getselflink that returns link object that includes the url the link class has gethref method that returns the url as a string from which we create a url then we just have to call the getentry method to get note that we give evententryclass as a parameter to indicating that specifically expecting the service to return event rather than just a plain entry for services other than you might just pass entryclass the above code is equivalent to sending httpaddr to calendar with proper to retrieve the first match from a search use the myquery new myresultsfeed entry firstmatchentry string myentrytitle this example starts by constructing a query object which mostly of a url plus associated query parameters each of the gdata query parameters has a setter method you can also set query parameters for a particular service using addcustomparameter after constructing the query we pass it to the method which returns a feed containing the query results alternative approach would be to construct a url yourself by query parameters to the feed url and then call the getfeed method the query method provides a useful layer of abstraction so that have to construct the url the getentries method returns a list of the entries in feed returns the number of entries in the in this case if the query returned any results we assign the matching result to an entry object then we use the entry method to retrieve the title convert it to the above code is equivalent to sending httpaddr s to by note google calendar associate labels with events so example work with to retrieve a feed consisting of all the entries that match the search and that are in a particular category or have particular label use the following mycategory new mycategoryfilter new mycategoryresultsfeed the category class of course represents a category to be used a category filter the querycategoryfilter class can multiple categories but in this case constructing a filter only one then we add that filter to the existing query which still contains query string from the previous we again use the query method to send the query to the if calendar allowed a category search the above code would equivalent to sending httpaddr to an to update an existing item use the following code in this changing the title of the previously retrieved entry from its text tennis with darcy to important editurl new updatedentry first we set a new title for the entry we fetched earlier then we the edit url for the entry using the geteditlink method then call the update method to send the updated the service returns the updated entry including a new url for new version for more information on entry versions see optimistic concurrency section of the protocol the above code is roughly equivalent to sending httpaddr to the service along with the new entry in atom format to the original an to delete the updated entry use the following deleteurl new the url to use for deletion is the same as the edit url so example is very similar to the previous one except of course calling the delete method instead of the above code is roughly equivalent to sending httpaddr to the for reference

available for sure your mind is positively buzzing with ideas for how to google app engine and a few of you might be interested in building app that interacts with some of other services via google data apis a number of products expose a data api including youtube google calendar and blogger a list is available here and these apis can be used to read edit the data they in this article we use the google documents list data api to through the process of requesting access from and retrieving data for particular user we use google app webapp framework generate the application pages as well as the google service to authenticate users with google some google data services require authorization from your users to data all google data services require their authorization before app can write to these services on the behalf there are methods in which a user can grant access to your application to services on their oauth the preferred recommended way to make calls on of users the user experience is similar to authsub but oauth used far more widely across the worlds of apis such facebook twitter netflix and linkedin you learn oauth you can use it in more authsub redirects a user to an authorization page after user authorizes your application to make calls on their they are redirected back to your application the application then supplied with a token used for making api calls on the clientlogin prompts a user for their google account which are then used to make api calls on their behalf we discouraging use of clientlogin in production applications it has a tendency to train users into building insecure web oauth is the current recommended best practice for making google api calls on a behalf this document describes how to oauth with the google data when a user authorizes an application to make api calls on behalf the following your application checks to see if an existing access token available typically this access token is persisted sessions access tokens provide an access specific to application and the user used for making api calls most providers do not expire access tokens but do provide users the ability to revoke tokens on a basis if access token is available and valid it you can making api if the access token is either invalid or otherwise link or redirect the user to a page hosted at httpaddr asking permission the user looks at the authorization page url to that they are providing their credentials in a secure manner to httpaddr your application should never deal with account if they are confident in allowing application access to their data the user clicks user returns to your application which can now access their make api calls the application side of things is slightly more your application requests a request token from the server request is signed with your consumer key and consumer you obtain these values from the management using the request token you redirect the user the page where the user should authorize your request the user is redirected back to your application this url specified either when you register your application domain manager console or when the request token is your request token is promoted to an access token which can now persisted indefinitely and used until the user revokes your make api calls a more detailed description of the oauth dance can be found in article using oauth with the google data in this article we walk through the process of doing the oauth to acquire a usable access token for a request to google data and storing the token in the datastore so that it can be reused returning the google offers an open source google data client library for that simplifies token management and requesting data from google data apis this library simplifies development and is used the code samples scattered throughout the remainder of the article you choose to use another library skip ahead to step the concepts apply in either to use this library with your google app engine application place the library source files in your directory import them as you usually would the source directories you need upload with your application code are and then sure to call the function each instance of a gdataservicegdataservice object more to it than note that if you are using gdataclient objects the call is not generating the access token authorization applications use oauth to obtain a permission for protected google data feeds the process is fairly simple to request permission to access a protected feed your app needs redirect the user to a secure page on httpaddr where that user sign in to grant or deny access after this the user is back to your app with the token stored in the url redirecting to a secure httpaddr login page your users have worry that their account credentials are stored insecurely by application or intercepted and used for nefarious your application needs to specify three things when using the consumer secret and key for your specific application you obtain these on the manage your domains the common base url for the feeds you want to the url that the user should be redirected to after your we first get a unique request token from google then we use on this token to generate the upgrade then save the request token in the datastore while the user is httpaddr when the user returns we retrieve the token secret the datastore and upgrade it to an access token we then use access token to access a google document first we define generic url mappings that capture all the urls call the script where our handlers live url mapping are defined appyaml an url script to illustrate this first step of using oauth in the app we create mainpy script that looks something like googleappengineext import googleappengineextwebapputil import googleappengineapi import constants included for ease of understanding it is a more and reliable practice to create a helper for reading a consumer and secret from a config file you may have different consumer and secrets for different environments and you also may not want check these values into your source code httpaddr create an instance of the docsservice to make api def this handler is responsible for fetching an initial request token and redirecting the user to the approval we need to first get a unique token for the user we provide the callback url this is where we want user to be sent after they have granted access sometimes developers generate different based on the environment you want to set this value httpaddr if you are running development server we also provide the data in general we to limit the scope as much as possible for example we just ask for access to all scopes httpaddr persist this token in the generate the authorization message a token for the google documents application in this example the url passed as an argument returns the user to our application the argument indicates which service our app is requesting for after clicking the link and authorizing your application you redirected to the url specified by with the request appended to the url you then upgrade this token and retrieving and updating a once an authorization request url has been generated we use the returned to our app to access the feed in question to do so we need to upgrade the request token retrieved in step to access token extend our simple example above to do few things oversimplify a bit and consolidate calling the api with the upgrading of the request token in a single block of in practice we want to handle each action in its own handler to separate responsibilities but this will do for below we added the code for the requesttokencallback handler mainpy which demonstrates upgrading to an access token as well making a docs api googleappengineext import googleappengineextwebapputil import googleappengineapi import constants included for ease of understanding it is a more and reliable practice to create a helper for reading a consumer and secret from a config file you may have different consumer and secrets for different environments and you also may not want check these values into your source code httpaddr create an instance of the docsservice to make api def this handler is responsible for fetching an initial request token and redirecting the user to the approval we need to first get a unique token for the user we provide the

running development server we also provide the data in general we to limit the scope as much as possible for example we just ask for access to all scopes httpaddr persist this token in the generate the authorization message a token for the google documents def when the user grants access they are redirected back to handler where their authorized request token is exchanged for access remember the token that we stashed get it back datastore now and adds information to allow it to become access we can now upgrade our authorized token to a access token by associating it with gdocs client calling the note that we want to keep the access token around as will be valid for all api calls in the future until a revokes our access for example it could be populated from reading from the datastore or some other finally fetch the document list and print document title the feed for entry in template application when the user clicks the google documents link they grant application access to their private data and they return to application our handler extracts the request use token from the combines it with the token secret stashed in the datastore upgrades it to an access token the application then uses this token to make api calls on the using the google data client library for python you can easily your google data feeds in your own google app the google data client library

javascript client fetching blogger post an entry to this article will walk you through creating a blogger gadget assumes you are familiar with the google data apis and javascript client library you should also be fluent in and have some experience implementing an opensocial gadget using gadgets this example also demonstrates how to successfully use libraries in your gadgets used jquery mainly for its effects and tinymce a great wysiwyg rich text editor it takes very little javascript to create a gadget that uses with one of the google data apis the major annoyance of such a is that the data is public and to build more gadgets you need access to a private data something requires until now there been a great way take advantage of the google account apis authsub requires redirects and clientlogin exposes a credentials even hacking up a gadget has been enter the oauth if not familiar with oauth its an authentication standard allows a user to share their private data with another website gadget the oauth specification requires that all data requests digitally signed this is great for security but in the case of javascript gadget managing private keys and creating signatures is insecure also the added complication luckily these problems are solved by taking advantage of a from the gadgets platform called the oauth proxy the oauth proxy designed to make life easier for gadget developers it hides much authentication details and does the heavy lifting for the proxy signs data requests on behalf of your gadget so need to manage private keys or worry about signing requests it the oauth proxy is based on an project called which is an implementation of the gadget note the oauth proxy is only supported for gadgets utililzing gadgets api and running in opensocial containers it is not for the legacy gadgets the rest of this tutorial will focus on creating a gadget to access blogger data go through authentication using the proxy using the javascript client library and finally posting entry to first things first we need to tell the gadget to use oauth to that add the oauth element in the moduleprefs service access httpaddr request httpaddr authorization httpaddr httpaddr the three url endpoints in the service element correspond oauth token endpoints explanation of the this parameter is required in the request url your gadget only be able to access data from the used in parameter in this example the gadget will access blogger if gadget wanted to access more than one google data api the additional with a as an example if you wanted access both calendar and blogger set the scope httpaddr this parameter is optional in the authorization url the approval page will redirect to this url after the user has access to their data you can choose to leave off this set it to your own approved page or preferably httpaddr the later the best user experience when users first install your gadget page provides a snippet of javascript that automatically closes popup now that we have our gadget using oauth the user needs to access to their data the authentication the gadget loads for the first time and attempts to access blogger the request fails because the user granted access to gadget fortunately the object returned in the response contains url responseoauthapprovalurl where send the user to the gadget displays the sign in to blogger and sets its href the value of next the user clicks sign in to blogger and the oauth page opens in a separate window the gadget waits for the user finish the approval process by displaying a link in the popup the user will choose to access to gadget once they click grant access taken httpaddr and the the gadget recognizes the window closed and attempts to blogger a second time by the data to the window closing used a popup handler if you such code the user can manually click the approved the gadget now displays its normal ui this view will unless the authentication token is revoked authentication so from the steps above gadgets have the notion of three unauthenticated the user needs to start the approval waiting for the user to approve access to their authenticated the gadgets displays normal functional in my gadget used div containers to separate each normal state of the gadget the user is authenticated form return div div select blog h input textarea h comma input input label a in to a approved an errors section is not necessary but great to have also not necessary but great for informing users each div is displayed by itself using see the example gadget for details on that the javascript client to fetch remote content in opensocial you make a call to gadgetsiomakerequest method using the gadgets api since building a google data gadget no need to touch gadgetsio apis instead leverage the javascript client which has special methods for making requests to each google note at the time of writing this article the javascript library supports blogger calendar contacts finance google base to use one of the other apis gadgetsiomakerequest without the the to load the javascript library include the common loader in content section and import the library once the gadget has initialized feeding a callback to will help determine when the gadget is script httpaddr script var blogger null make our service object global for load the js library and try to fetch data once function initgadget packages save overhead load the blogger blogger new the call to tells the library to use oauth proxy instead of authsubjs its normal lastly the gadget attempts to retrieve the data by calling that method is defined now that things are all setup how do we actually get or post data a common paradigm in opensocial is to define a function fetchdata in your gadget this method typically

using the spreadsheets obtaining posting content to the using the cellsfeed to update ruby is a dynamic scripting language that has received a good amount attention in recent years due to the popular rails framework this article will explain how to use ruby to interact google data api services we will not focus on rails instead we more interested in explaining the underlying httpaddr commands structure of our feeds all of the examples presented here can followed from the command line by using irb interactive as you may recall from the curl article the google data apis the atom publishing protocol to represent create and update resources the beauty of this protocol is that standard httpaddr are used to formulate requests which are answered with httpaddr status the verbs that we will be using in this article are get to content post to upload new content and put to update existing some of the standard codes that you may come across in using the data apis are to represent success in retrieving a feed or entry or to represent the successful creation or update of resource if something goes wrong such as when a malformed request sent a code meaning will be sent back a detailed message will be provided in the response body explaining exactly went ruby provides a nice debugging option as part of the for the sake of keeping these code samples reasonably short i have enabled it here and installing ruby can be installed using most package management systems if you using linux for other operating systems and to obtain the full code please visit httpaddr irb interactive shell that we are going to be using for these should be installed by default to follow the code examples here you will also need to install xmlsimple a small library to xml into ruby datastructures to xmlsimple please httpaddr once you have a copy of ruby running on your machine you can use httpaddr package to make basic requests to data services snippet below shows how to do the necessary imports from interactive shell what we are doing is requiring the httpaddr package parsing the url for the top rated video feed from youtube then performing an httpaddr get require httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr uri httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr uriport do httpaddr puts httpaddr httpaddr that request should have echoed quite a bit of xml to the command you may have noticed that all of the items are contained within feed element and are referred to as entry elements let us worry about xml formatting just yet i just wanted to explain how make a basic google data api request using httpaddr we are going to apis now and focus on spreadsheets since the information that we send and retrieve is more using the google spreadsheets we will again start by retrieving a feed of entry elements this though we will want to work with our own spreadsheets in order to that we must first authenticate with the google accounts as you may recall from the documentation on httpaddr are two ways to authenticate with services authsub is applications and in a nutshell involves a process the real benefit of authsub is that your application does need to store user credentials clientlogin is for applications in the clientlogin process username and password sent to services via httpaddr along with a string that the service that you are looking to use the google spreadsheets service is identified by the string switching back to our interactive shell authenticate google note that we are using httpaddr to send our authentication and require httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr path now we are passing in our actual authentication please visit this link for more about the accounttype data set up a hash for the headers httpaddr httpaddr post the request and print out the response to retrieve our authentication resp data httpaddr data peer certificate be verified in this ssl httpaddr ok snipping out the rest of the authentication strings strip out our actual token auth and store dqaaaiuaaadzl snip build our headers hash and add the authorization googlelogin googlelogin snip ok so now that we are authenticated let us try to retrieve our spreadsheets using a request httpaddr since this is an authenticated request we also want to pass in headers actually since we will be making several requests for feeds we might as well wrap this functionality into a simple which we will call store the uri to the feed since we may want to use it httpaddr create a simple method to obtain a def uri httpaddr uriport do httpaddr return httpaddr lets make a request and store the response in httpaddr ok httpaddr ok examine our xml showing only an excerpt xml httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr spreadsheets httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr again we are seeing a lot of xml which i have above you need to worry about deciphering it from the command line make things more let us instead parse it into datastructure using perform require require doc import the module for require our xml pp httpaddr httpaddr spreadsheets httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr snipping out the rest of the xml so as you can see in the output above my feed contains to keep this article short i have cut off the rest of the xml above as well as in most other to dig deeper into spreadsheet we will need to perform a few more obtain the spreadsheet use the spreadsheet key to obtain our worksheet obtain the id for the worksheet which we want to request either the cellsfeed or listfeed to access the content of the this may sound like a lot of work but i will show you that quite easy if we write a few simple methods the cellsfeed and are two different representations for the actual cell content of worksheet the listfeed represents an entire row of information and recommended for posting new data the cellfeed represents cells and is used for either individual cell updates or batch to many individual cells both using please refer to the documentation for more first we need to extract the spreadsheet key highlighted in the output above to then obtain the worksheet extract the spreadsheet key from our using our method obtain the worksheet httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr ok parse the xml into a snip and pp httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr snip cutting off the rest of the xml as you can see here we can now find the links highlighted above accessing the listfeed and cellsfeed before we dig into the let me quickly explain what data currently exists in our spreadsheet so that you will know what we are looking our spreadsheet is very simple and just looks like language java httpaddr php httpaddr and here is what this data looks like in the httpaddr response httpaddr ok snip again we parse the xml and then pretty print pp httpaddr httpaddr language httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr snip as you can see the listfeed returns your content creating an entry for each row it assumes that the first row of spreadsheet contains your cell headers and then dynamically xml headers based on the data in that row looking at the actual will help explain this snip namespaces httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr language snip cutting out links and author information httpaddr snip updated and category title content httpaddr link httpaddr link httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr snip updated and category title content httpaddr link httpaddr link httpaddr httpaddr for a quick comparison let us look at how the same information represented in the extract the cellfeed httpaddr response httpaddr ok parse into datastructure and snip pp httpaddr httpaddr language httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr snip as you can see here entries are returned one for each cell i cut off all the other output besides the value for cell a contains the word also notice the edit link shown this link contains a version string srvbs at the end the string is important when updating cell data as we will do at the of this article it makes sure that updates get whenever you are making a put request to update cell data you include the latest version string in your request a new string will be returned after each content to the the first thing we need in order to post content is the post link the listfeed this link will be returned when the list feed requested it will contain the httpaddr as the value for the attribute you will need to parse this link element and extract href attribute first we will create a small method to make def data uri httpaddr httpaddr return httpaddr data set up our post httpaddr httpaddr we must use as mime type so change our which were still set to httpaddr when we sent clientlogin information over httpaddr setting up our data to post using proper httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr performing the httpaddr created the status indicates that our post was the cellsfeed to update from the documentation we can see that the cells feed prefers requests on existing content but since the information that retrieved from the cellsfeed earlier above was only the data that already in our actual spreadsheet how can we add new information will simply need to make a request for each empty cell into which want to enter data the snippet below shows how to retrieve the cell row column in which we want to insert some about the python programming our original variable contained just the uri for cellfeed itself we now want to append the cell that we are looking edit and obtain that cells version string to make our set our query httpaddr request the information to extract the edit httpaddr ok xml httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr as you can see in the code listing above the version string is you may need to scroll all the way over to the right side to things easier let us create a convenience method that gets us version string for any cell that we are interested def response require xml return a quick puts while we are at it we may as well write a method to perform the request also or better yet let us write a method to perform entire batch update our function is going to take an array hashes containing the following a unique identifier for each piece of the the id of the cell to be updated in format cell a would be represented as data the data that we want to def xml feed httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr do data row column link return our sample batch data to insert information about the python programming into our data data httpaddr httpaddr perform the response httpaddr ok parse the responsebody xml and print snip pp httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr snip as you can see our batch request was successful as we have the ok response code parsing the response xml we can see that separate message is returned for each individual that we in our array for more information on batch please refer to the as you have seen it is very easy to use interactive shell play around with the google data apis we were able to access spreadsheets and worksheets using both the listfeed and additionally we have inserted some new data using a post request then written methods to perform a batch update with only about lines of code from this point it should not be too hard to wrap of these simple methods into classes and build yourself a please join us in the discussion groups if you have any about using these tools with your favorite google data a class file with the code samples detailed above can be found httpaddr discuss this last updated may google developers terms of privacy report a you need to be signed in with to

returned google provides a set of client libraries for interacting services in a variety of programming languages these libraries you can construct gdata requests send them to service and receive this document provides a set of examples of common uses of the version of the client library followed by other information writing gdata clients at the end of this document is a link to reference documentation for the client library in ndoc to use this client library you need the net runtime and should also be current on all download the net client this examples refer to the google calendar api but this is not an accurate or guide to using the calendar api information about using the net client library with a data api see the documentation example if working with calendar read the calendar api data model tutorial and this document is intended for programmers who want to write applications that can interact with gdata this document assumes that you understand the general ideas behind google data apis protocol it also assumes that you know how program in model the client library provides a set of classes that correspond to elements and data types used by the google data apis for a feed class which corresponds to the element has methods for creating an entry getting and setting the values various and so on also an entry class corresponds to the element not every element defined the google data apis has its own class for details see reference the library can automatically parse atom content and put the values the atom elements into appropriate objects for example the method gets a feed parses it and returns a feed object with resulting to send a feed or entry to a service you create a feed or object then call a library method such as the insert method automatically translate the object into xml and send you can parse generate xml yourself if you prefer the way to do that is with an appropriate just as the google data xml syntax is extensible corresponding object model is extensible for example the library provides classes corresponding to the elements defined in google data and the following examples show how to send various gdata requests the client to make them more concrete these examples show how to interact with specific service google calendar point out places calendar differs from other google services to help you adapt examples for use with other services for more information calendar see the google calendar data api and running your to compile the examples in this document need to use following using a as described in the google calendar data api document you request a calendar feed by sending the following httpaddr request httpaddr of course you have to replace userid with the email see the calendar document for details you can instead use special default url for interacting with calendar as described in calendar document but in this document use the private feed url which contains the user you also have to provide appropriate authentication note that authentication system using here known as google for installed applications is appropriate only for use in client applications such as desktop clients not for use in applications for more information about authentication see google account authentication to request a calendar feed using the client library for a user email address httpaddr and password mypassword use following create a query and service query new service new set your httpaddr create the query new httpaddr tell the service to calfeed the service class represents a client connection with to a gdata service the general procedure for sending a query to service using the client library consists of the following obtain or construct the appropriate if sending data to a service for example if inserting a new entry then transform the raw data into using the client library classes this step apply just requesting a feed as doing in this create a new service instance setting the service name such cl for calendar and your name in the set the appropriate call a method to send the request and receive any the servicesetusercredentials method sets the property with a standard net network credentials object credentials are set to the id and password of the user on whose your client is sending the query the examples in this document use authentication for installed applications authentication for more information about other authentication systems see google account authentication to request an entire feed you call the servicequery method takes a feedquery object and returns the entire feed found at that show how to send more specific queries later in this like other methods of the service class query handles and redirects as a new to insert an item into a calendar feed you might use the entry new author new jo httpaddr tennis with meet for a quick posturi new httpaddr send the request and receive the insertedentry after setting the url we construct an atomentry the entry title is a atomtextconstruct a class that holds text various forms plain text html or the entry content represented by an atomcontent object a class that can hold plain text or other forms of content including xml and binary each author is represented as a name a uri and an email address this example leaving out the uri you add an author to an by adding an atomauthor object to the authors using the same service object that we created in the example in this case the method to call is insert which sends item to the specified insertion the service returns the newly created entry which may additional elements such as an edit url for the above code is equivalent to sending httpaddr proper authentication and providing an a specific the following code lets you request the specific entry that inserted in the previous in the context of this series of examples retrieving that entry really necessary because calendar already returned the inserted but the same technique can be applied whenever you know the url for singlequery new new newfeed retrievedentry the inserted entry has a property selfuri that returns an object that using its tostring method can be used to create a uri then we just have to call the query method to get a atomfeed object with just one entry in its entries the above code is equivalent to sending httpaddr to calendar with proper for an to retrieve the first match in a search use the myquery new myresultsfeed myresultsfeedentriescount atomentry firstmatchentry string myentrytitle this example starts by constructing a feedquery object which mostly of a url plus associated query parameters each of the gdata query parameters has a after constructing the feedquery we pass it to the method which returns a feed containing the query results alternative approach would be to construct a url yourself by query parameters to the feed url and then call the query method the feedquery method provides a useful layer of abstraction so that have to construct the url the entries collection returns a list of the entries in feed entriescount returns the number of entries in the in this case if the query returned any results we assign the matching result to an atomentry object then we use the title property to retrieve the the above code is equivalent to sending httpaddr to by note google calendar associate labels with events so example work with to retrieve a feed consisting of all the entries that match the search and that are in a particular category or have particular label use the following mycategory new mycategoryfilter new mycategoryresultsfeed the atomcategory class of course represents a category to be used a category filter the querycategory class can contain categories but in this case constructing a filter with only then we add that filter to the existing query which still contains query string from the previous we again use the query method to send the query to the if calendar allowed a category search the above code would equivalent to sending httpaddr to an to update an existing item use the following code in the example changing the previously retrieved title from old text tennis with beth to important important first we set a new title for the entry we fetched earlier then we call the upate method to send the updated entry to the the service returns the updated entry including a new url for new version for more information on entry versions see optimistic concurrency section of the protocol the above code is roughly equivalent to sending httpaddr to the service along with the new entry in atom format to the original an to delete an existing item use the following the url to use for deletion is the same as the edit url so example is very similar to the previous one except of course calling the delete method instead of the above code is roughly equivalent to sending httpaddr to the with google calendar the above examples outline how to use the google data api to with generic gdata feeds when working with a google feed in particular though the feed contains a lot data that is not easily accessible using the objects in the base api library to help you with those feeds we provide the following the extensions namespace deals with extensions in general the namespace gives you access to a customized calendar service feed query object you can find a more elaborate example of how extensions are used in the subdirectory of the installation the following objects are a subclass of feedquery which allows you to set two parameters for the calendar service and a subclass of service which can return an event a subclass of atomfeed exposing a subclass of atomentry which has additional properties to calendar for more details about those special classes see the api and the samples for reference information about the client library see reference documentation in ndoc back to last updated may google developers terms of privacy report a

want to write applications that can interact with picasa web albums it provides series of examples of basic data api interactions using raw httpaddr with explanations after reading this document you can learn about interacting with the api using our client libraries reading the examples found on the other sections this for picasa web albums data api reference information see reference this document assumes that you understand the general ideas behind google data apis protocol each example in this document shows how to use the bare protocol to interact with picasa web an you may want to sign up for a picasa web albums account for when your application requests user data it must include authorization token the token also identifies your application authorization we recommend using oauth to authorize the picasa web albums data api also supports older options such as oauth authsub or however in most cases we recommend using those other options your application already uses those options we recommend migrating oauth if if your application has certain unusual authorization such as logging in at the same time as requesting data hybrid or delegation of authority lo then cannot currently use oauth tokens in such cases you must use oauth requests with oauth requests to the picasa web albums data api for user must be authorized by an authenticated the details of the authorization process or flow for oauth somewhat depending on what kind of application writing following general process applies to all application when you create your application you register it with google then provides information need later such as client id and a client activate the picasa web albums data api in the services pane of google apis console if it listed in the console then this when your application needs access to user data it asks google a particular scope of google displays an oauth dialog to the user asking them authorize your application to request some of their if the user approves then google gives your application access your application requests user data attaching the access token the if google determines that your request and the token are valid returns the requested some flows include additional steps such as using refresh tokens acquire new access tokens for detailed information about flows various types of applications see oauth the oauth scope information for the picasa web albums httpaddr to request access using oauth your application needs the information as well as information that google supplies application registration such as the client id the tip the google apis client libraries can handle some of authorization process for you they are available for a variety programming languages check the libraries and samples page more a every request that you send using the data api should specify version of the to specify a version number use the httpaddr alternatively if you set httpaddr headers you can specify as query parameter in the url but the httpaddr header is preferred note the client libraries supply appropriate version automatically so use the query parameter when using client with albums are the way picasa web albums groups photos into useful these albums can be public or unlisted and have their own such as a geographic location a description or a you do not have to authenticate to retrieve data about public but in order to create update or delete content you must using one of the methods discussed in the authentication a list of to get a feed listing all of the albums belonging to user userid an

and when uploading modifying or removing photos you will have authenticate using one of the methods discussed in authentication a list of there are different ways to retrieve photos the most common is to a list of all of the photos in an album but you can also recent photos from a user or search photos from the public albums other photos in an to get a feed listing all of the photos in an album with the albumid belonging to user userid send an httpaddr request like following to picasa web httpaddr note the string default can be used in place of a real user id which case the server will use

if the etags match then the entry changed picasa web albums returns an httpaddr not modified status if the etags match then the photo has been modified since last time you requested it and picasa web albums returns the for more information about etags see the google data reference a new there are two ways to add a photo to an album using the data upload the binary image data along with its metadata to do use mime content type send photo metadata one part of the post body and image data in part this is the preferred upload the binary image data without the while all photos appearing on the picasa web albums site are in jpeg format photos of any of the following types can be uploaded the a photo with to send metadata along with the photo post to the following httpaddr and use the following format for the body of the multipart httpaddr cat wants attention category httpaddr httpaddr image note that the title element contains the filename you want to use the a photo without to send a photo without its associated metadata post to the httpaddr and use the following format for the body of the image data goes the optional slug httpaddr header specifies a filename for picasa albums to use for the photo not specifying a slug causes the to use a default title for the note if you want to post a photo but want the hassle requiring the user of your app to choose an album you can post photo to the drop box this special album will automatically created the first time it is used to store a photo to post to the box use an albumid value of httpaddr a new a video is posted in the same way as a photo with metadata instead an image mime type you have to use an appropriate video mime type recognized video mime types note you cannot submit a video without metadata at this time you use a mime multipart request like in the posting a photo metadata videos have to undergo some processing before they become available streaming in order to monitor the current processing state the entry returned after posting a new video will contain an element the element can also be found in photo feeds the four possible values of the status element pending the video is still being ready the video has been processed but still needs a final the video has been processed and has received a failed a processing error has occured and the video should usually a video can be or accessed at the url in the section of the entry feed shortly after the status ready or final the element will contain the url to the flv video your own video normally the video processing system will automatically provide thumbnail at the end of the processing stage this thumbnail is from one of the first few frames of the video instead you can your own thumbnail by simply following the steps outlined updating a photo you can do this at any time while the video still being processed or afterwards automatically provided always come at qvga resolution x to account for than aspect ratios eg black borders will be added to top and bottom of the thumbnail all uploaded videos are processed and converted into streaming that can be played back using the flash video player integrated the picasa web albums two streaming formats are currently created the with a maximum resolution of by pixels and an mp stream a maximum resolution of x in both cases the maximum upload size is you currently download original video files however you download the flv video stream or the mp video stream by using the from the video elements provided in the photo or feed one element for each video a you can replace the metadata the binary image data for a the following sections explain in each case to make sure that your update overwrite changes include an httpaddr header that contains original etag value you can determine the original etag value by examining the entry if you want to update the photo regardless of whether someone else updated it since you retrieved it then use and include the for more information about etags see the google data reference a photo and its to replace both the binary data and metadata for the photo that inserted earlier use an httpaddr request like the httpaddr the url is the value of the link tag that returned after you did the earlier in the body of the put include the updated metadata and image data the same multipart format that you used to do the post with note with put you do a partial update of an entry you have send the full entry data to replace the existing data you however use put to send only the metadata or only the image described in the following in order to make other types partial updates you must use patch the section on partial updates for only the to replace only the binary data use the following httpaddr httpaddr the url is the value of the link tag that returned after you did the earlier in the body of the put include the replacement image data in the format that you used to do the post without only the to replace only the metadata and not the image itself follow the steps that you would follow to send an update to a in particular send the following httpaddr httpaddr the url is the value of the link tag that was after you did the earlier in the body of the put provide the updated metadata in the form of element containing image note you use put to do a partial update of an entry you have send the full entry metadata to replace the existing to do partial updates you must use patch see the section partial updates for the photo itself is not to the a to delete a photo and its metadata send an httpaddr delete request either the edit link or the link in both cases the and metadata are for example to delete the photo from the previous httpaddr if you want to make sure that you delete a photo that has changed by another client since you retrieved it include an httpaddr header that contains the original etag value you determine the original etag value by examining the if you want to delete the photo regardless of whether someone else updated it since you retrieved it then use and include the etag in this case you need to retrieve the before deleting for more information about etags see the google data reference with tags are a convenient way to label and organize your photos associating photos with descriptive strings it makes searching large quantities of photos note picasa web albums tags are unrelated to etags and both unrelated to the a list of your program can retrieve a list of tags that are used by a user in particular album or that are associated with a particular tags by the following request returns a feed of the tags that userid has in photos in their httpaddr note the string default can be used in place of a real user id which case the server will use the user id of

some special features are available to help you optimize your web albums data api a partial response if there are many items in a feed the xml that is returned by server can be quite long with the picasa web albums data api you ask for only the feed or entry information you need at the given in your application by requesting a partial response you significantly reduce the overhead of transferring and parsing to request a partial response use the fields query parameter following example shows a request that returns only the needed when providing a quick rendering of all albums where thumbnails link to the albums themselves the fields parameter specifies that the response should include only album titles number photos and thumbnail image url along with the url for the album for each album in the note as with all query parameter values the fields parameter must be url encoded for better readability the example below the httpaddr this request eliminates a large amount of irrelevant data from response in this case there was more than a reduction bytes httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr link httpaddr httpaddr link httpaddr httpaddr link httpaddr httpaddr more entries you can use partial response with any picasa web albums request returns data including get post and put as well as patch which used for making partial update note if you want to use the result of a partial response as the of a subsequent patch request it can be useful to include the etag edit link information in the for more information about partial response see the google protocol reference a partial update you can also make changes using a partial resource representation partial update you send only the changes rather than a version of the full resource to make a partial update request use patch instead of put you the patch request to the same edit uri that you normally use with the data you send is a partial entry that represents the changes want to make to the target note the picasa web albums api is in that it does allow fields to be deleted as a result it does not support attribute with patch requests normally you use a entry attribute with patch to specify which fields are to be from the target for more information on patch semantics see partial update in protocol reference the example below shows a patch request that changes the setting for an album to make it unlisted the partial entry has with a value of when this is sent with patch request the data provided is merged with the target effecitvely the new access value replaces the old one for the httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr after processing a valid patch request the server returns an httpaddr status code along with a copy of the full representation of updated if you prefer to have the server return only certain

inside data a glimpse inside data by rich may nd a photo google released last week showing servers in one of facilities click for larger version of the image photo been a while since had a good look at the inner of a google data center where the company houses its servers sure seen networking rooms chillers and piping water treatment plants but we seen one of production server environments since when published video of containers packed with servers by then had already moved away from containerized designs and indicated that the servers and designs featured the event were already several generations last week google published photos of some of its servers as part of a larger presentation that explains how an makes its way across the internet the images one shown another at the end of this article show rows of racks packed with servers and bathed in the green light of the leds each server tray so take a closer look and see what these photos might be able to tell us about data each rack in the photo is populated with servers typical of servers google designs its own servers which include battery in each tray a configuration that allows to save power by avoiding the conversions required with centralized ups and battery banks google uses its most newest most powerful servers in its search we optimize our fleet by repurposing older servers for that require the same processing power such as gmail picasa google says this strategy has translated into savings in hardware budget allowing it to avoid buying to servers for context only a handful of admit to having more than an interesting wrinkle the racks are on wheels heard about deployments in which servers in their racks and are rolled into place leaving wheels on the racks allows for mobility and ease of but raises other for example how would this configuration perform earthquakes seismic isolation systems provide some leeway rack movement during temblors but having them on wheels could life interesting during a major quake possible that racks are either deployed at a google data center in an area few earthquakes occur such as the carolinas or atlanta or may represent a full production raised one of the photos shows rows of racks on either side of a corridor with a row of perforated floor tiles this is typical a design in which cold air enters the server area through plenum in the cold aisle with air pressure guiding cool air up and through the racks as the air passes through racks it removes heat from the components and exits through back of the rack into the hot aisle where it is then routed cooling equipment for but is this primary cooling design what heard recent years is that google data centers featured raised but used them primarily to house piping for water rather than as cool air plenum the water was used in a cooling system features cooling units in the hot aisle which function much heat exchangers removing the heat from the air returning it back to the room at the supply air temperature prevent recirculation of hot exhaust air the water used in heat exchanger then goes to a cooling tower and is but the reports heard appear to align neatly with configuration shown in these latest for what worth google has also sought to patent an cooling piping system including air wands that provide amounts of cold air to components within a server tray the has also patented a design for a server sandwich in which motherboards are attached to either side of a mysteries the question remains is this production environment computing lab or testbed google has always treated the details its data centers as proprietary saying its expertise innovation in its data centers represents a competitive given that and the fact that the showcased older technology possible that these photos may represent the current state of production or perhaps the story of send marks the beginning of a shift which google discloses more of its current technology as has done with the open compute if not continue to analyze and speculate until more emerge and yes still waiting for the photos of the filled with sharks with laser beams on their the second another view of google servers click for a larger version posted may nd do the racks sit on wheels the pictures in the article detailed enough to notice any wheels for me at least is there link to the original pictures assuming there is more than expect that there would be retractable legs on the rack of a better word which can be lowered once the rack is in place take the weight off the wheels and make it more something like this which is from a par rack which can weigh much as pounds fully httpaddr the wheel is barely visible under the rack and then there little legs that come down to hold the rack once in place clamp is there because the rack is mounted on a steel plate distribute the weight better if it so close to the edge a surface there would be no need for the add your comments name required email not be published

search search in date range all search this blog search all tag future of the monthly june may april march i left msdn blogs jw on tech why i left i left rate james mar comments ok i relent everyone wants to know why i left and individually scaling so here it is laid out in its long read a little i get to the punch line in the rd paragraph or it all but a warning in advance there is no drama here no no former colleagues bashed and nothing more than you surmise from happening in the press these days google and its attitudes toward user privacy and software this is simply a more personal it an easy decision to leave google during my time there became fairly passionate about the company i keynoted four developer day events two google test automation conferences and was prolific contributor to the google testing blog recruiters often me to help sell high priority candidates on the company no one had ask me twice to promote google and no one was more surprised than when i could no longer do so in fact my last three months working google was a whirlwind of desperation trying in vain to get my the google i was passionate about was a technology company empowered its employees to innovate the google i left was advertising company with a single technically i suppose google has always been an advertising but for the better part of the last three years it feel one google was an ad company only in the sense that a good tv show an ad company having great content attracts under eric schmidt ads were always in the background google was like an innovation factory empowering employees to be through awards peer bonuses and time our revenue gave us the headroom to think innovate and create forums app engine google labs and open source served as staging grounds our inventions the fact that all this was paid for by a cash stuffed full of advertising loot was lost on most of us maybe engineers who actually worked on ads felt it but the rest of us convinced that google was a technology company first and foremost company that hired smart people and placed a big bet on their to from this innovation machine came strategically important products gmail and chrome products that were the result of entrepreneurship the lowest levels of the company of course such runaway spirit creates some duds and google has had their share of those google has always known how to fail fast and learn from in such an environment you have to be part of some inner circle to succeed you have to get lucky and land on a project to have a great career anyone with ideas or the skills contribute could get involved i had any number of opportunities leave google during this period but it was hard to imagine a place to but that was then as the saying goes and this is it turns out that there was one place where the google machine faltered and that one place mattered a lot competing facebook informal efforts produced a couple of antisocial dogs in and buzz orkut never caught on outside brazil like the hare confident enough in its lead to risk a brief nap google from its social dreaming to find its front runner status in google could still put ads in front of more people than facebook facebook knows so much more about those people advertisers publishers cherish this kind of personal information so much so they are willing to put the facebook brand before their own exhibit httpaddr a company with the power and clout of putting their own brand after no company has ever done for google and google took it larry page himself assumed command to right this wrong social a corporate mandate called it was an ominous invoking the feeling that google alone enough search had to social android had to be social you tube once joyous in independence had to be well you get the point even worse that innovation had to be social ideas that failed to put the center of the universe were a suddenly meant google labs was shut down app fees were raised apis that had been free for years were deprecated provided for a fee as the trappings of entrepreneurship dismantled derisive talk of the old google and its feeble at competing with facebook surfaced to justify a new google promised more wood behind fewer the days of old google hiring smart people and empowering them invent the future was gone the new google knew beyond doubt what future should look like employees had gotten it wrong and intervention would set it right officially google declared that sharing is broken on the web nothing but the full force of our collective minds around fix it you have to admire a company willing to sacrifice sacred and rally its talent behind a threat to its business had google right the effort would have been heroic and clearly many of us to be part of that outcome i bought into it i worked on as development director and shipped a bunch of code but the world changed sharing never changed arguable that we made better but all i had to show for it was higher review as it turned out sharing was not broken sharing was working fine dandy google just part of it people were sharing all around and seemed quite happy a user exodus from facebook never i even get my own teenage daughter to look at social a product she told me after i gave her a demo is people and the people are on facebook google was the rich kid after having discovered he invited to the party built his party in retaliation the fact that no one came to became the elephant in the and me we were simply never meant to be truth is been much on advertising i click on ads when gmail displays based on things i type into my email message it creeps me out i want my search results to contain the rants of posters or for that when i search for london walks i want better than the sponsored suggestion to buy a london walk at the old google made a fortune on ads because they had good content was like tv used to be make the best show and you get the most revenue from commercials the new google seems more focused on commercials perhaps google is right perhaps the future lies in learning as about personal lives as possible perhaps google is a judge of when i should call my mom and that my life would be better i shopped that nordstrom sale perhaps if they nag me enough about that open time on my calendar work out more often perhaps if offer an ad for a divorce lawyer because i am writing an email about year old son breaking up with his girlfriend appreciate that enough to end my own marriage or perhaps figure all this out on my the old google was a great place to work the new button input not button input button

error o o client o query o core reporting api dev o o o o reference o dimensions o client o query o funnels reporting api dev o reference o dimensions conversion o error o google apis o community developer api data this document provides a detailed reference on the data feed version of the core reporting data feed data feed data feed error handling large data reports in the analytics user interface are generally organized these traffic internal site each report regardless of the section to which it belongs consists two primary and dimensions analytics reports use combination of metrics and dimensions to describe key types of activity to your website such as which search engine visitors used reach your site in the search engines report or which pages on site received the most traffic in the top content report the core reporting api groups both dimensions and metrics into categories of report data by choosing your own combinations dimensions and metrics you can create a customized report tailored your keep in mind that not all categories of data can be combined in single request when you request a combination of dimensions metrics that are not allowed you will receive an error instead of an actual feed this causes no harm so feel free experiment with combinations of metrics and dimensions that seem useful for a detailed list of the metrics and dimensions you query see the dimensions metrics to understand how analytics data is applied to the profile you requesting data for see the background document on accounts back to feed this section describes all the elements and parameters that make up data feed request in general you provide the table id to the profile you want to retrieve data from choose the of dimensions and metrics and provide a date range along with parameters in a query httpaddr or httpaddr the base url for a data feed the unique table id used to retrieve the analytics report data this is provided by the element for each entry in the feed this value is composed of the ga namespace and the profile id the web back to the dimensions parameter defines the primary data keys for analytics report such as or use dimensions segment your metrics for example while you can ask for the number of pageviews to your site it might be more interesting to for the number of pageviews segmented by browser in this case see the number of pageviews from firefox internet explorer and so when the value of the dimension cannot be determined analytics the special string not there are a number of situations the dimension value will not be set for example suppose you want query your reports for country city and pageviews and suppose following is true for your profile pageviews on your site came from only two identified each of those countries had only two identifiied some number of pageviews also came from areas that could not mapped to either a country or a some pageviews could be mapped to a country but not to a within that the results for this request would return data as illustrated by following example country city not set not set country a not set country a city a country a city a country b not set country b city b country b city b when using dimensions in a feed request be aware of the you can supply a maximum of dimensions for any you can not send a query comprised only of dimensions you combine any requested dimension with at least one any given dimension can be used with other dimensions or but only where valid combinations apply for that for more information and the list of all dimensions see the section in the dimensions and metrics back to the aggregated statistics for user activity in a profile such clicks or pageviews when queried by alone metrics provide the values for the requested date range such as overall pageviews or bounces however when requested with dimensions values are by the dimension for example requested with returns the total pageviews per country when requesting metrics in all requests require at least one you can supply a maximum of metrics for any not all dimensions and metrics can be used together consult valid combinations tool to see which combinations for more information and the list of all metrics see the section in the dimensions and metrics back to indicates the sorting order and direction for the returned data example the following parameter would first sort by then by in ascending if you do not indicate a sorting order in your query the data sorted by dimension from left to right in the order listed example if the query looks like sorting occurs first by then by however if query uses a different sorting occurs first by then by when using the sort parameter keep in mind the sort only by dimensions or metrics value that you have used in dimensions or metrics parameter if your request sorts on a that is not indicated in either the dimensions or parameter you will receive a request strings are sorted in ascending alphabetical order in an numbers are sorted in ascending numeric dates are sorted in ascending order by the sort direction can be changed from ascending to descending by a minus sign prefix on the requested field for sorts ascending by and ascending by sorts first in descending order and then in ascending order by back to filter filter filter combining or and the filters query string parameter restricts the data returned your request to the analytics servers when you use the parameter you supply a dimension or metric you want to followed by the filter expression for example the following query requests and from profile the dimension starts with the string httpaddr filtered queries restrict the rows that do or do not get included the result each row in the result is tested against the filter if filter matches the row is retained and if it match the row url encoding the java client library automatically encodes filter operators however when you use the javascript library or make requests directly to the protocol you explicitly encode filter operators as indicated in the table dimension filtering filtering occurs before any dimensions aggregated so that the returned metrics represent the total only the relevant dimensions in the example above the number pageviews would be only those pageviews where firefox is metrics filtering filtering on metrics occurs after the are valid combinations you can filter for a dimension or metric is not part of your query provided all in request and the filter are valid combinations for example might want to query for a dated list of pageviews filtering on particular browser see valid combinations for back to filter a single filter uses the operator in this name the name of the dimension or metric to filter on example will filter on the pageviews operator defines the type of filter match to use operators specific to either dimensions or expression states the values included or excluded from results expressions use regular expression filter there are six filter operators for dimensions and six operators metrics the operators must be url encoded in order to be included url query tip use the data feed query explorer to design filters that url encoding since the explorer will automatically url necessary strings and spaces for caption metric operator description url encoded form equals return results where the time on the page is ten does not equal d return results where the time on the page is ten greater than e return results where the time on the page strictly greater than ten less than c return results where the time on the

characters characters such as must be in the usual reserved characters the semicolon comma and backslash must be backslash escaped when they appear in an semicolon comma backslash regular expressions you can also use regular expressions filter expressions using the and operators their syntax similar to perl regular expressions and have these maximum length of characters regular expressions than characters will result in a bad request code returned from the case sensitivity regular expression matching for more information on common regular expression matches supported google analytics see

query to return large result sets the below will help you optimize your api query avoid errors and quota overruns keep in mind that we establish a baseline level optimization for any given api request by allowing a maximum number dimensions and metrics while some queries that specify numbers of metrics and dimensions can take longer to process others limiting the number of requested metrics does not improve query performance instead you can use the techniques for the best performance paging through results can be a useful way to break large results into manageable chunks the data feed tells you how many matching exist along with giving you the requested subset of rows if there a high ratio of total matching rows to number of rows returned then the individual queries might be taking longer necessary if you need only a limited number of rows such as display purposes setting an explicit limit is fine however if purpose of your application is to process a large set of results in entirety then it is most efficient to request the maximum splitting the query by date instead of paging through the results of one long range consider forming separate queries for one even a time for a very large data set it may still be to page through results such as when a request for one day contains more than the maximum number of result rows per query in case if the number of matching rows for your query is higher than max results rows breaking apart the date range may improve the time to retrieve the answer this is true whether the queries are sent in a single thread or in use filters consider whether additional filters might reduce the data while providing the information you need can a dimension filter such as regular expression match on a page path return the subset of the you care about can value thresholds such as ignoring matches less than visits filter out less interesting results this can be used as a complement to any of the other suggestions earlier with this technique the actual time to get each result set likely to be about the same but fewer result pages would be thus reducing the overall interaction time and minimizing impact your quota back to last

boss serving one some of these terms are features of good teams for example is a feature of a team that is working well together but are some teams whose collective performance falls short of what might expect given the quality of individuals the apollo is a good example of this where a team composed of highly people often performs worse than teams made of up of less the term to one can be a misleading one in organisational structure people reporting to one boss often form a team but reporting lines are frequently designed the constraints of grading structures of necessity there is often compromise between the need for traditional reporting lines grouping people together who are a team in reality team are often complicated and people can be members of several because a team is a group of people working together towards a consider the example of a financial services organisation pensions who is a member of the from the definition of a team you first have to define the common of the

management teams how the individuals within the team relate can have a big bearing team performance if a member leaves or another joins the dynamics the team can be changed greatly here the scale is small say about and the team building consultant endeavours to relationships between team members using tools such as the mbti the team a larger scale operates between teams where the teams do not well they are called and it is the between the teams that becomes the focus for the the largest scale is that of organisational team building with exception of the senior management team the ability of individuals make an impact on the corporate culture is very limited one of the aims of the team building consultant is to change the behaviours attitudes prevalent in the organisation which are almost of who actually works there new recruits who are start behaving in accord with the existing a team is a group of people working towards a common team building is a process of enabling the team

decided to get to the of how and why google secretly collected personal data from millions of the citizens this week the office reopened its investigation there is a problem however the ico permitted google to destroy controversial data two years it is rather difficult for the ico to now turn the clock back indeed prove anything chris pounder a data protection expert the training firm amberhawk was quoted as saying in the the back story google was forced to reveal in the spring of its street view mapping cars had also been scooping up information unencrypted networks in homes and businesses as investigations began around the world the company maintained that data collection had resulted from an unauthorized project by engineer acting on his own and that very little consequential data been collected in july ico officials visited google headquarters in and viewed a sample of the data as served up by the search technicians not much to it the investigators concluded on basis of the samples we saw we are satisfied so far that it unlikely that google will have captured significant amounts of a second look in persuaded the investigators that personal data had indeed been obtained but it was the communications much more thorough examination concluded two months ago that prompted the ico to take yet crack at we understand that a wide range of personal data together with sensitive data was present in the payloads including ip full user names telephone numbers complete messages headings instant messages and their content logging in medical listings and legal

have irked mr eckersley was that what originally billed as a simple mistake was not according to fcc quite so simple others at google were informed if the was collected deliberately then it is clear that this is a situation than was reported to us in april mr eckersley google told the british media that its executives did not want the and had never looked at it and that it would cooperate with

university in st louis and a research fellow at the federal reserve bank of st louis juan correa allamand is a researcher at the ministry of finance chile david k levine is the john h biggs distinguished professor of economics at washington university in st louis and a research fellow at the federal reserve bank of st louis carmine ornaghi is a lecturer in economics at the university of kind of intellectual property regime is more favorable to innovation one that enforces patents or one that does not economic theory is unable to answer this question as valid arguments can be made both for and against patents hence we must turn to empirical evidence in this paper we review empirical evidence gathered by other researchers and add new evidence of our own we conclude that the evidence suggests that patents do not promote innovation but instead retard papers on public policy vol cato institute start comp a all alterations page and and concern is with a straightforward policy question which kind of intellectual property regime is more favorable to innovation hence more conducive to technological progress increasing factor productivity and eventually economic growth more what is the role that patents play or do not play in fostering technological innovation a practical policy question such as this rarely has a straightforward answer this may be one of those rare cases when it does our final answer in fact will be that there is no evidence whatsoever that patents and copyright foster innovation and creation at large while there is abundant evidence that they damage it in particular instances apart from inducing substantial efficiency and distributional allow for a focused discussion we will pretend that a starker difference between legal regimes exists and it is the object of than is probably feasible in reality where legislation must act on a multidimensional continuum of choices on the one hand we consider a regime in which patents are assigned easily and then strictly and forcefully enforced for a long time as has been the case in the united states for more than a century and increasingly so since the middle s on the other hand we consider a counterfactual regime in which patents are hard to obtain loosely enforced and last for brief periods of time only ie a system in which imitation and the competition it brings about rule subject to the qualifications discussed in the paper we call the latter arrangement and the former one we ask which regime is more desirable from a social point of a theoretical level this question receives two but completely opposite answers within a certain class of models is the necessary evil without which innovation is impossible within a second class of models nicely provides innovation and in some cases even reaches comp a all alterations page papers on public on the kind of assumptions one is willing to make about the set of available technologies the cost of imitation and the speed at which productive capacity can be built economic theory may go either way in one case when innovations are dramatic and well identifiable the cost of technological discontinuities is very high productive capacity is easily built and imitation is costless intellectual property is likely to be a is recognized today as the in the opposite case when innovations are a distributed and incremental phenomenon the cost of which while sometimes high in the aggregate is relatively low at each single step productive capacity cannot be rapidly adjusted and imitation is costly patent protection is likely to be a arrangement this latter view is considered nowadays a form of it happens to be a view of the innovation process that among others two of us have been suggesting as appropriate for quite a while see eg boldrin and levine question of which regime actually induces more innovation and is more socially desirable has been hardly considered at the empirical level where most researchers have been taking it for granted that patents and copyright are the best incentives to innovation hence to economic growth because at the end of the theoretical day the issue is an empirical one it is to the small amount of available empirical evidence to which we add a bit of fresh material that we dedicate the bulk of this paper our examination leans strongly toward the heretic option all things considered patents do not have a favorable impact on technological innovation and tend to hurt economic welfare nevertheless we will not even try to claim the issue can be settled on the basis of the available evidence if anything because the latter is still scarce and organized as mentioned maybe because so little relevant data have been collected or maybe because the received wisdom has been so dominant for so long that empirical verification appeared redundant the number of empirical papers addressing the policy question we have asked turns out to be very small better data and more systematic analysis are therefore needed before any conclusive policy prescription may be proceed through the following steps in section we start with a brief summary of the main theoretical features of the received wisdom that wisdom has two sharp and testable predictions comp a all alterations page and the stronger the monopoly power granted by patents the higher the incentive to innovate hence the faster the growth rate of the innovation process consists of a sequence of jumps at each step a new innovator incumbent monopolist acquires a patent to protect her new innovation and becomes a temporary monopolist soon to be overtaken by an even better empirical support for these predictions is considered in section and we find it to be scant in fact we show that neither a nor b receives any support in the statistical or historical cogently empirical research has focused on two lines of the ie the fact that in recent decades as patent protection was progressively strengthened we did not observe an innovation the ie the claim that in the data while it is apparent that strong monopoly power does not favor innovation free competition may not be all that good either and innovation is maximized somewhere in the we have little to add to the interesting findings collected in the literature we believe that something more can be said about the claim here we make two points one general and the other specific the general point is that using the number of patents or their citations count to measure the actual number of innovations or better their impact on productivity across sectors and firms may lead to somewhat biased results while many innovations lead to a patent at least equally many other do not while many patents are associated with an actual innovation at least equally many others are obtained for legal or purposes that have little or nothing to do with actual we show while citations may be vaguely correlated with productivity growth they are far from being a reliable measure of it this suggests treating with the greatest care those studies that assume a close identity between the two showing that in the data x may increase patents is a long shot from showing that x also increases innovations and labor productivity the specific point in great detail in the phd dissertation of one of us comp a all alterations page papers on public is that the finding does not actually withstand a careful statistical examination and disappears rather quickly when we the very same dataset in which the relation was claimed to exist we find instead a robust monotone relation between measures of competition and the number of patent citations as the heretic view predicts this relationship is summarizes the heretic line of thought according to which imitation does not hamper and in fact stimulates heretic view predicts that we should observe a higher rate of innovation in those sectors in which competition is stronger and patent protection weaker because as we argue the heretic line of thought rests on the assumption that most technological progress is embodied in either human or physical capital we also briefly discuss the cumulated empirical evidence supporting this section we test our theory using recent data by merging three different micro datasets on patents patent citations and productivity growth at the sectorial level we show there is a clear monotone increasing relationship between measures of sectorial competition the innovative activity of firms and most importantly labor productivity and total factor productivity tfp growth the implications of our findings for future research and actual policymaking are collected at the end in section received intellectual roots of the currently dominant consensus about the role that patents and monopoly power play in the innovation process were planted long ago schumpeter ought to be seen as its starting point while scherer is a leading current rendition among industrial organization famous paper by kenneth arrow provided debatable but authoritative support for the view is a public that view in turn gave rise to two completely opposite lines of research and related policy to one line of thought if innovation is a public good then it cannot be provided by the markets be they competitive or monopolized innovation needs therefore to be either produced directly by government agencies or at least subsidized by means of fiscal revenues and tax incentives this was the line of thought comp a all alterations page and initial argument was meant to support and that still appears as a logical consequence of the in our view patently falsified view that innovation is a public good according to the second line of research stemming from assumption innovation becomes an undersupplied public good because the property right system is poorly designed those contracts through which innovation can be made excludable are not available in a competitive market system as long as the latter allows for imitation patents can solve this particular version of the of the they make innovations excludable thereby insuring at least a outcome gilbert and shapiro contains a relatively recent and more elaborated exposition of this point of view this approach which had come to dominate theoretical and applied work in the area of industrial organization by the late s was incorporated into dynamic models of economic growth and capital accumulation with the arrival of the growth ngt in the late s and early a theoretical perspective these two renditions of the view that and legal monopoly are essential for are what we have in mind when we speak of the currently received wisdom purely because of its very simplified analytical structure we will use here the aghion and howitt model as our for this otherwise vast literature almost we say applies equally well to all other ngt models produced since the middle s in particular to those of gene grossman and elhanan helpman and of paul romer which were both prior to that of aghion and howitt as well as to the classical contributions in the field of industrial literature posits a htradeoff between under free competition insofar as this leads to an efficient allocation of resources for a given technology and which is due to technological progress driven by patented innovations aimed at acquiring a monopoly while competition may yield static efficiency it fails to deliver the dynamic one because the latter is arguably more important than the former free competition is not good for society patents are therefore a even if they sustain a technologically artificial monopoly power thereby reducing consumer surplus while they last they are a necessary tool for fostering dynamic efficiency over time innovative comp a all alterations page papers on public would find no reward if the monopoly power that patents create were absent no patents no are two key technological assumptions underlying the prediction that under competition and dynamic inefficiency ie suboptimal innovative efforts would be the the private fixed costs of innovation are at least relative to the size of the market and the evaluation willingness to pay that the marginal consumer would give of the new imitation is both simple and cheap so much so that within a small span of time so much productive capacity can be built up that every competitor would be led to play a bertrand game when it comes to is obvious that in a world where these two assumptions are simultaneously realized one would observe no innovation absent protection innovators would know that as soon as they had sunk their fixed cost and introduced the new good or the new production method imitators would flock into the market at zero cost building up excessive capacity and because of bertrand competition driving prices to variable marginal costs because the latter makes it impossible to cover the initial fixed cost entrepreneurs would not even bother trying to innovate thereby leading the economy to technological stagnation from this reasoning there follows on the one hand the prediction that industries where imitation is easy will not see much technological progress and on the other the prediction that in presence of strong patents innovation will instead thrive this is statement a in the is worth stressing that statement b is neither marginal nor dispensable in this framework when b fails the model predicts that a also would fail and innovation would come to a halt even in a world where patents guarantee innovators a strong monopoly power to see this assume the current incumbent monopolist either through a sequence of very small innovations or by the key factors its competitors need in carrying out their research and development efforts maintain its lead on the pack thereby progressively reducing their chances to ever be able to the incumbent with a breakthrough innovation in other words assume the incumbent monopolist can make valuable innovations extremely costly for its potential competitors in this case comp a all alterations page and b fails together with in the schumpeterian model when the monopolist is so far ahead of its competitors to feel safe enough the innovation machine stops operating and the economy becomes stagnant see piazza for an insightful formalization of this argument in a dynamic general equilibrium the theory of creative destruction does require monopolists to be every so often if the monopolist never gets overtaken then according to the theory there cannot be any concerns about the received wisdom should one doubt the sharp and reassuring predictions of such an elegant theoretical apparatus in the we can have our cake and eat it too patented entrepreneurs are safely protected by the legal monopoly bestowed upon them making higher and safer profits while innovative activity hence technological progress and labor productivity growth proceeds at the highest possible pace this distinct characteristic of the paradigm may well be the main reason behind its wide academic and public success by telling us that monopoly power is socially benign because it generates economic growth at the very minor cost of some losses of consumer surplus it reconciles the desire of protecting what is already established with the urge to foster world of low risk and high returns though seems too good to be true at a minimum it contradicts the basic economic intuition according to which there are no free lunches and in a world of tradeoffs rewards always entail some costs more to the point economic theory has been arguing for centuries that competition is conducive of good economic performances and good management practices and all the available evidence nickell blundell et al carlin et al and okada are some of the main references within a very wide literature for a decently recent survey see van reenen suggests that indeed this is the case if in general more competition has been shown to foster better allocation of resources lower production costs better management practices higher and effort adoption of technological best practices and so on then it would be hard to believe on purely theoretical grounds that technological change and innovation should comp a all alterations page papers on public such an extraordinary exception to this general and repeatedly confirmed simple observation after all was at the root of an unfortunately but remarkably prescient paper by george stigler who somewhat lonely tried to argue that to the best of his knowledge most of the great innovations of any century had been created under conditions of competition and in the absence of patents and legally enforced monopoly power that same paper contains a simple somewhat artisanal empirical test in which stigler uses war ii data to regress a raw estimate of sectorial labor productivity growth against an index of sectorial finding that indeed the less concentrated an industry was the faster labor productivity grew at least back then as far as we can tell that was the first empirical refutation ever published of what is now and was becoming then the established wisdom times may have changed since and they have indeed changed hence the need for replicating test using more recent data and more advanced statistical techniques which we do in section getting to it let us consider a few other facts casting serious doubts on the realism of the who key prediction of the schumpeterian view of innovation is that the latter is the special product of large business organizations unique contribution to economic growth and to the increased social welfare it brings about matter of fact argument rests more on the deep pockets and planning capabilities of large conglomerates than on patents and intellectual property per se after convincing himself do not ask us how that socialist planning was the best way to achieve economic growth he was intent to convince his readers that through the actions of the protected monopolies we could have our cake and eat it too socialist planning for workers and consumers and private property for the few lucky the historical and statistical evidence points to the exact opposite of what schumpeter predicted while large corporations are often not always maybe not even most of the times but certainly often the outcome of major innovations sometimes patented and sometimes not think of ford and edison sears and amazon microsoft and google and major innovations are seldom if ever the product of large and monopolistic comp a all alterations page and on the contrary breakthrough innovations are more often than not the product of small firms competitive and creative outsiders that must compete with established incumbents and are able to do so because of their creative superiority this fact which has been remembered and then forgotten innumerable times in the applied economics literature is documented once again in the recent work of william baumol one of the most articulate supporters of the central role played by the mechanism in generating economic growth so for example in baumol we find an excellent summary of a series of studies produced between and by the us small business administration documenting that in spite of the fact that the bulk of activity is carried out by large corporations the share of technological breakthroughs come from small firms one may argue that these findings may be biased by the fact that the task is to argue exactly that this is a correct observation that nevertheless cannot erase the fact that the data reported in those studies have withstood various years of attempted criticism and that the author quoting them with approval is one of the strongest supporters of the schumpeterian view of technological progress a second critical observation may point out that a number of large corporations ibm xerox bell labs or microsoft have been innovating a lot leave aside the fact that one would have a very hard time making the list longer than the one above the fact is that the first three ibm xerox and came up with lots of good ideas when they were the dominant monopolists in their industries but left those ideas in their drawers not turning them into actual innovations until the breakup of their monopoly power forced them to compete with new entrants only then did their good ideas turn into actual innovations which is exactly the opposite of what the viewpoint implies as for microsoft the answer is even simpler if historically symmetrical to the previous one microsoft was a great innovative company until it had to fight to stay ahead of its competitors but it stopped innovating once it acquired its monopoly of fact microsoft would already be history if it were not for the monopolistic grip it maintains on the market through its operating that the bulk of innovations does not come from large corporations but from small ones may or may not matter for those comp a all alterations page papers on public to a more view of the creative destruction mechanism but it should at least serve as a reminder that if patents are socially helpful it is not because they allow the big conglomerates to innovate as in initial theory but maybe they allow the newcomers to enter a market hence as far as evidence is concerned we are restricted to considering the hypothesis that patents are good mostly for small firms and are instrumental to the inception of new industries is this the leads to a more sharply defined empirical question consider the or most economically relevant of the last century or two from electrical machines and appliances to chemical and then pharmaceutical products from the car to the aviation industries from software to hardware to mobile devices from retail distribution to steel from the movie and television industry to banking and finance most of these sectors are now relatively mature and dominated by a few large companies either or even worldwide though to different extents nevertheless when we look back at their inception be it more than a century or ago not only do we not see any big conglomerate say the personal computer or the and protecting it with a patent but practically always we see groups of small and unprotected entrepreneurs introducing the new goods or services without much patent protection at least in the very initial stages of the industry the fact is that even in the few cases when the innovation that revolutionized an industry comes from within and relatively large companies in the same industry think of the role that has played for example in dramatically increasing the productivity of the retail and distribution sector or that the investment banks played in the s and s in creating the modern financial industry patents play either a minor role or no role at all in the gestation of the initial the light of these and plenty similar observations we wonder why in the applied industrial organization literature the following question seems to have never attracted the attention of researchers what does actually happen over the life cycle of a new question is at the same time historical and statistical purely descriptive in some sense but of great theoretical relevance how did the new industries that have actually emerged since the inception comp a all alterations page and the industrial revolution about two centuries ago come many were fostered by a large conglomerate protected by an array of patents along the life cycle of a new when does intellectual property enter the scene and starts playing a positive role in fostering innovation is intellectual property there from the very beginning is it really the essential obstetrician without whom the healthy infant would never see the light of day let alone grow to become the powerful athlete it eventually will or is it something that comes much later in the life of innovative industries when the rate of innovation slows down the technology tends to mature and the classic stage is under way or has just passed our guess maybe anecdotal but not completely uneducated is that the emerging from such a careful historical investigation would be exactly the one we are suggesting here through our rhetorical questions as far as we can tell the main role intellectual property has played in the initial development of the great industries of the last two centuries has been either none or to delay some of them see eg boldrin and levine a chaps and for the cases of the steam engine and the airplane respectively in the few cases in which patents helped some among the initial innovators such help was either damaging to the growth of the industry overall as in the case of radio through the controversial marconi patents or it played an ambiguous role by first enabling either or something pretty close to it and then leading to the creation of and scarcely innovative monopolies as in the cases of alexander graham bell and the and of rca and the the only important to these stylized facts we can think of are associated with the name of thomas edison the light bulb and related electrical certainly we may be wrong which is why we hope someone better equipped than we are will find the time and energy to look carefully into this issue for the time being though all the modern industrial history available in print and online says that the prediction is much more a fable than is the observation that while in the established model of creative destruction progress comes from a new comp a all alterations page papers on public overcoming the incumbent one with a superior innovation rendering the old patent irrelevant this seldom happens in practice while we have been unable to find in the literature a systematic statistical evaluation of this prediction and due to lack of means we are unable to carry it out ourselves we are willing to argue on the basis of a careful examination of a large number of industries that this is another nice fable that almost never has turned into actual observation readily applies to mature industries where we observe two kinds of market structures emerging most common is the case in which the efficient technology is so widely accessible that the sector has remained competitive and still experiences a large amount of entry and exit even many decades after having reached its maturity eg textile and apparel furniture and house appliances food and drinks retail distribution and hospitality and so on and so forth for a long array goods and services these mature industries still experience a fairly large amount of creative destruction with local or temporary leaders emerging and disappearing at a relatively high frequency and more importantly a sustained growth of labor productivity still all this is achieved with little or no use of patents as a tool for enforcing monopoly power thereby contradicting at least one of the two basic predictions of the model innovations keep taking place in these industries without the help of the same model is also contradicted for the complementary reason by those mature industries that evolved toward a oligopolistic market structure and in which patents are frequently used to enforce monopoly rights over innovations in these cars and trucks trains and airplanes personal computers proprietary software applications shipbuilding medicines durable goods in general market leaders tend to remain the very same few for very long periods of time decades and decades in fact with very little often literally zero entry of creative outsiders in all these industries patents are certainly used and a high level of innovative activity does take place but the creative destruction mechanism predicted by the model never materializes there may be but there is very little destruction after a couple of decades microsoft word no matter how cumbersome and little different from years ago it happens comp a all alterations page and be still is the market leader in word processing not to speak of excel the last time the market for word processing or for experienced any kind of patents were verboten in the software industry this is not an exceptional case as a quick examination of the industries listed above or of your own consumption basket for that matter will easily confirm there is a lot of healthy creative destruction in economies but little of it comes from the new creative patentee overtaking the old and no longer creative more patents higher us move on to a more delicate issue is there a sharp and well defined relationship between patents and actual technological innovations no matter how you turn it around the theory predicts that the stronger the monopoly power patents and the higher the number of patents issued the stronger productivity growth should be without and without coherently with such prediction patents their numbers and the number of times they are cited by subsequent patents are by far the most commonly used measures of innovation in most empirical industrial organization studies apart from the predictions of the received wisdom this common academic habit has another reasonable justification plenty of econometric work starting with pakes has shown that citation indices are a good measure of quality and market are for example important predictors of the stock market valuation of the firm owning the patents frequently cited patents are economically very valuable while scarcely cited patents tend to be associated with valueless innovations in going from this finding to the conclusion that patent citations are an overall good measure of innovative activity though there is a logical step which we consider problem is twofold it seems reasonable to believe that if a given innovation is both valuable and patentable the innovator will have an incentive to seek a patent while a number of surveys levin et al cohen et al show that innovative firms very often rely on tools other than patents eg secrecy lead time and so on to achieve and maintain their competitive advantage there is no doubt that when possible firms do patent their valuable innovations it follows therefore that some innovations are contained in comp a all alterations page papers on public and that some patents contain actual innovations the problem arises once we try replacing the two occurrences of the in the last statement with the words safely performing such substitutions is necessary for treating and patent as adequate empirical measures of very many industries patenting was not even an option until a short while ago eg the s for plants the s for software the s for business practices etc and it is still not a truly usable option for many other ones eg retail and distribution financial products fashion and design telecommunications and so what this means is that lots of valuable innovations are not captured either by patents or by patent citations making the latter an incomplete measure of the former as the data below show a very large number of innovations are most certainly not captured by patents the other side of the problem is subtler how many patents are issued consequently how often a patent is cited by subsequent ones is determined by the specific legal and industrial organization characteristics of each different industry tens of thousands of patents are awarded each year in the software industry while those in the car industry are counted in the hundreds some of these patents have innovative contents but many others are patents taken out for purely legal purposes and with little or no innovation inside them the cumulative research work of james bessen and his coauthors eg bessen has made this fact plain in the case of the software patenting became legally possible and spread widely across the industry the actual amount of innovation carried out certainly did not increase and probably diminished thereby making patents and citations a very poor measure of what we often take them to be our own somewhat artisanal examination of the agricultural sector eg boldrin and levine a chap has led us to the same conclusion after they were legally allowed in the early s the number of agricultural patents exploded especially in recent decades thanks to the introduction of products there is no evidence of a structural break whatsoever in the time series of agricultural tfp either in the united states or in whatever it is that the dramatic increase in agricultural patents may be measuring it cannot be the movement in agricultural comp a all alterations page and because it is the latter we care about one should conclude that neither almost all innovations are contained in patents nor almost all patents have innovative studies aside how serious is this problem statistically across a wide array of sectors and firms in other words for the overall economy how poor a measure of productivity growth are patents and their citations we try shedding some light on this question by computing conditional and unconditional correlations between patents and productivity measures from the same datasets we use later in section to carry out our main tests in this instance we have computed measures of labor productivity and tfp sector by sector together with patent numbers and citations for the firms in each sector next we have regressed both their levels and growth rates on each other in a variety of reasonable combinations both unconditionally and conditioning for investment activity in previous years and a number of control not perfectly homogenous our findings are nearly so their basic message is that except for a couple of specifications reported below there is not even a significant positive correlation between patents and productivity this is a more surprising result than one would predict on the basis of purely theoretical considerations in fact one would expect patents to be at least a decent predictor of productivity growth across sectors certainly for the last couple of decades during which their use was extended to more and more sectors instead we find a weak correlation in only two of the many possible specifications and no correlation at all otherwise the data suggest in other words that the use of patents either as a defensive or as a rent seeking tool boldrin and levine b is actually more widespread than we had estimated it to specification yields a statistically significant but very small positive coefficient when we apply it to us bureau of labor statistics bls output data and a coefficient not statistically different from zero when national bureau of economic research nber output data are used a quick look at figure suggests that a few data points may be driving the result hence figure reports the same data without the top percent observations for citations in figure the correlation is role that the three statistical outlier sectors play in satisfying the received predictions is revealed by computing the year mean at the north american industry classification system comp a all alterations page papers on public citations vs labor productivity growth citations vs labor productivity growth level for both variables in each sector this is depicted in figure also for sectorial averages once the top percent values of the variable are dropped the statistical correlation weakens substantially and also in this subsample appears to be determined by a small number of sectors this is depicted in figure similar in fact weaker results obtain when measures of tfp are used in the appendix we report a number of additional plots that are representative of the kind of results one obtains with different specifications as the various graphs vividly illustrate even in the very long run patents and their citations measure only vaguely those innovations that actually increase either labor productivity or tfp and do so only for a handful of observations are concentrated near the origin of the horizontal axis corresponding to very few or no patents and patent citations at all they display as much variance in the measured growth rates comp a all alterations page and citations vs labor productivity growth top citations vs labor productivity growth top productivity as the overall sample does signaling that the larger fraction of innovations are not captured by suggests that patents should not be used to assess which firm innovates more and which firm innovates less unless one is capable of controlling for effects and the various strategic and legal considerations different firms face at different points in time from the point of view of economic theory and social welfare what matters is the growth of productivity and not of the number of patents per se contrary to what it has been doing for decades under the influence of received wisdom empirical research in this area should focus on the former as the proper measure of socially desirable outcomes treating the latter as a tool just a legal tool that may or may not foster desirable innovations and productivity growth whether patents do or do not improve productivity should be the question we ask the data not the preset answer from which we start our comp a all alterations page papers on public patent citations and average labor productivity patent citations and average labor productivity growth recent years an empirical of the position has emerged within the framework of position is widely seen as a way of reconciling the theoretical predictions of that line of thought with the growing evidence that increasing monopoly power does not generate more but less innovation among others the paper by aghion et al contains the main empirical findings giving support for this position while the book by aghion and griffith provides a broader overview of the whole line of et al develop a model in which competition is measured by the elasticity of substitution within pairs of goods each pair produced by a duopolistic industry in this setting the higher the elasticity of substitution between the two goods is the higher the return from innovation for either of the two duopolists will be assuming that sometimes one of the duopolists finds itself to be a technological leader relative to the other a high elasticity of substitution between the two goods reduces the incentives to innovate for the laggard when its distance from the leader becomes comp a all alterations page and patent citations and average labor productivity patent citations and average labor productivity growth top large the authors interpret this kind of model as predicting that the maximum innovative effort will obtain at position between perfect substitutability competition and perfect complementarity they compare these predictions with the patenting activity in the united states for a panel of united kingdom manufacturing firms claiming that their predictions are supported by the data this is interpreted as a vindication of the basic intuition behind the theories according to which at least some degree of patent protection and monopoly power is good for technological medio stat robustness and even the very same existence of such empirical findings are questioned in the works of correa first and then of hashmi the latter the relationship between competition and innovation by using a different dataset comp a all alterations page papers on public publicly traded manufacturing firms in the united states between and apart from a minor statistical detail hashmi mimics the estimation strategy of aghion et al he replicates their results for the uk dataset but when using the us dataset he finds a robust positive relationship between competition as measured by the inverse of markups and innovation as measured by hashmi conjectures that the different findings may be due to the underlying characteristics of the two different economies in particular he claims that a possible of the sharply different results may come from the fact that in his view the us manufacturing industries are technologically more than their counterparts in the uk in other words there is a lot more competition among firms in the united states than in the uk in this case because no competitor is ever the leader the incentives to innovate that competition induces are stronger because there are not many laggards giving up the race there are also very few leaders that are able to keep the lead without further innovations the argument is more than a bit lopsided because in these regressions means a low markup and the argument we just summarized does not explain why in the united states firms with very low markups should innovate a lot while in the uk the same kind of firms innovate very little further as hashmi remarks this conjecture is not really supported by the data and there is no independent evidence in the literature that this should be the case finally we note that even if the conjecture were supported by the data it would simply mean that indeed the more competition there is the better competition works this tautology at the very end does not account for the different empirical results between the us and uk firms which remains a investigation carried out by correa shows instead that there is no puzzle and that this particular conjecture is not necessary to account for the different correlations observed in the two is because most likely the pattern that aghion et al claim to have discovered in the uk data is either not robust to very reasonable perturbations or it is not there at all guided by the well documented recent history of the us patent system correa begins his investigation by carrying out a simple chow test on the aghion et al data to find evidence that a structural break comp a all alterations page and and patent citations prior to the and patent citations prior to the place in the early s this structural break coincides with the establishment of the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit cafc in scholars of intellectual property have amply documented that the establishment of the cafc had a dramatic impact on the enforceability of patents and greatly strengthened the position of patent holders see eg jaffe and lerner kortum and lerner it therefore increased the incentive to apply for patents and those applications started to increase at about that time by taking into account this break correa finds a positive relationship between innovation and competition during the period and no statistically significant relationship during the period displays the sample observations of innovation and competition levels before the establishment of the cafc period we can see that some particular industries such as comp a all alterations page papers on public and patent citation after the creation of the and patent citation after the creation of the vehicles standard industrial classification digit code and chemicals sic have higher levels of innovation than the rest of the manufacturing sector however as figure shows after the establishment of the cafc both the motor vehicles and the chemicals industries decreased their innovation intensity while industries such as other manufacturing sic sugar beverage and tobacco sic and office and computing machinery increased their number of chow test looks for only one structural break without using additional information about its location in time clearly the break could have taken place in another year or there could be more than one break hence a test is performed which makes no assumptions about either the number or the location of the structural breaks this test finds just one structural break and places it in comp a all alterations page and the cafc was established only in however it is worth noting that in the dataset a patent is assigned to the year in which the application was filed rather than the one in which it was it is now greatly increased reaching almost three years a substantial lag between applications and grants existed already in the early s furthermore the establishment of the cafc did not come as a surprise to anyone but was the consequence of a long and public debate about the opportunity of introducing such a court to strengthen the us patent system it seems therefore reasonable to expect patent applications to react somewhat earlier on in anticipation of the october leave it to the reader to decide which way the final jury should lean we are satisfied with having shown that indeed once one takes into account a little tiny bit of well know history the relationship is gone and a clear relation connects the degree of competition with the strength of innovation also in the particular dataset used by aghion et al that is we like to recall the one and only dataset discovered so far in which a modified version of the theory appears to be a different point of in the data one can hardly find any support either for the claim that stronger intellectual property regimes favor technological change or for the general theory according to which monopoly power fosters innovation there is in fact good evidence for the opposite while there is scant evidence even for the claim that patents are a reliable measure of productivity growth it is important to understand how markets for innovation and technology adoption might function in the absence of intellectual property innovative activity has taken place historically and does take place currently as plenty of evidence shows in markets where intellectual property restrictions are either absent or even not allowed hence in order to explain the existence of something that standard theory predicts should not even exist ie competitive innovation one needs to develop an alternative theoretical framework which we briefly outline the paper we quoted earlier stigler p argues that monopoly is completely unnecessary to provide incentives for comp a all alterations page papers on public can be rewards and great ones to the successful competitive innovator for example consider the business the innovators were aaron montgomery ward who opened the first general merchandise establishment in and richard sears sears soon lifted his company to a dominant position by his magnificent talents and he obtained a modest fortune and his partner rosenwald an immodest one at no time were there any conventional monopolistic practices and at all times there were rivals within the industry and other industries making more recent times liebowitz hellwig and irmen quah legros and boldrin and levine have all examined the competitive rents that accrue to innovators due to the fact that in a competitive market the owners of a fixed factor first copy of an idea are the recipients of all downstream rents originating from it and that an infinite number of copies cannot be made instantaneously the conclusion is that innovation will take place even without intellectual property as it often has in the past see eg the cases mentioned by moser while some of this work shows that there may be too little innovation under competition due to the indivisible nature of the initial copy of ideas it also suggests that the appropriate remedy is unlikely to be a the one hand it seems transparent that providing a reward for innovation in the form of a monopoly can only increase innovation at least on impact indeed this idea is so obvious it seems to have an intellectual grip on the economics profession that a of empirical evidence to the contrary has been unable to break there is however a flip side to a patent system as opposed to an individual patent a patent system not only rewards innovators it also makes it more costly to innovate in the face of the many licenses that need to be acquired in order to bring a new product to market hence from a purely theoretical point of view the impact of patenting on innovation is ambiguous it both encourages and discourages innovation once this fact is taken into due account it is perhaps not such a surprise that no evidence has emerged that there is a net positive effect scotchmer is among the first to point out the problem that occurs when innovations build on existing ideas formal models first in the form of a simple example and later comp a all alterations page and the form of a detailed model of innovation were provided in boldrin and levine the positive side boldrin and levine examine innovation that is driven by the for new technologies when old technologies have exhausted their growth potential in such a setting perfect competition delivers the as competitive rents are exactly what is needed to provide the socially optimal level of invention hence any intervention in the form of a monopoly strictly reduces welfare because a monopolist would accumulate each technology more slowly than under competition thereby increasing the time it takes to move from one technology to the next more productive one thereby reducing the growth rate of further aspect of the theoretical problem as stigler briefly noted in his article is that the formal definition of competition is capable only of capturing the final stylized outcome and fails to describe the process in a perfectly competitive industry the participating firms are small relative to the size of the market produce the same identical goods with the same identical technology and act as because there is nothing they can do that can alter anything of relevance in the market in which they a description of may be useful for the study of general equilibrium arrangements in certain settings but it hardly seems capable of describing the underlying intuition according to which try to outsmart each other by both imitating the best practices and improving upon them reducing production costs as much as possible thereby de facto implementing technological change to finally bring about some form of equalization among the surviving firms it is the latter though and not the former that one has in mind when saying intuitively that fosters or competition then the proper analytical answer to this unpleasant state of affairs while one could be tempted to say at least instinctively and then follow along the lines of aghion et al and identify the extent of competition with the degree to which one good is a substitute for another there are good reasons not to go that way the extent to which a new good is or is not a substitute for an already existing one is an endogenous equilibrium choice not an institutional or technological comp a all alterations page papers on public as innovators elect which niche to enter on the basis of market incentives this is in fact one of the channels through which competition fosters innovation the free entry of choosing either to expand total productive capacity or to build up on previous innovations by introducing close substitutes of the existing goods until we are able to build workable models of free entry in which this dynamic aspect of competition is captured over time we must face the unpleasant choice of either going to the extreme of in which everyone always does the same thing or to that of in which every firm is actually a monopolist acting in parallel to other similar any case the key conceptual problem with the approach to modeling competition is that it is grounded in the idea that imitation is costless hence competitive rents are irrelevant and competition would always bring about bertrand pricing when imitation is costly but competitive rents are not immediately equal to zero therefore imitation is profitable competition evaporates and the dynamic process of competition with free entry sets in in practice imitation is costly and as noted above a patent system serves only to discourage downstream imitation the latter point is important because in practice as shown by the managerial surveys cited earlier innovations tend to be protected more by the difficulty of imitation than through government intervention in the form of patents this means that de facto the role of patents is to discourage competition free entry and indeed innovation old incumbent firms acquire large patent portfolios covering tens of thousands of known ideas with the aim of using them as barriers against any entrant that does not have a similar let us consider the following criticism of the theoretical argument according to which competition favors innovation more than legal monopoly boldrin levine model has a first mover advantage of course then if the first mover advantage is big enough you do not need patents i never understood why we should pay attention to such a trivial point theoretically the empirical question of whether first mover advantages comp a all alterations page and be enough is of course is there something that i have been missing all of these is true that the essence of the boldrin and levine model is a advantage generating competitive rents boldin and levine repeatedly mention it in their original paper on perfectly competitive innovation boldrin and levine b which was in fact meant to show how the traditional framework of a competitive industry with free entry and minimum plant size could easily be adapted to model repeated innovation in a setting but there are two aspects in boldrin and paper that are not trivial at all at least not for the modern innovation and growth literature first they make the argument that there is always a advantage and that one can predict how large it is on the basis of observables in other words they give some structure to what the above criticism calls an advantage and show under which conditions it may or may not obtain in practice for instance given the elasticity of demand they show that the advantage and the incentive to undertake an innovation depends on two things the initial cost of getting the first unit of output the prototype and the rate at which the invention can be copied second and related to the previous point even in markets where it is very easy to reproduce the innovation the rent of the first mover can potentially increase if between periods are we think there is a deeper point that the misses also in a regime of monopolistic competition there is a advantage a monopoly but whether the advantage is a legally induced monopoly power ie a market distortion or competitive rent fully efficient is quite relevant for both positive and normative is relevant for positive empirical analysis because one can use statistical data to quantify the two uses of in the the initial fixed cost is small enough relative to the size of the market and the cost of copying is high enough we will observe sustained innovation under conditions of it is relevant for normative analysis because to the extent it allows us to explain the thousands of episodes of competitive innovation observed in reality it provides us with guidance for setting policies in this comp a all alterations page papers on public the expression seems to imply that once there is a the advantage goes away it does not and the framework mentioned earlier captures this important fact well while the one of monopolistic competition misses it completely this is because in the framework one assumes that capacity is bounded at every point in time and costly to accumulate which is not the case in the monopolistic competition case because of this assumption in a competitive industry rents are generated more or less for the entire life of the industry in the baseline case without any external effects all the rents do go to the first mover but in more general cases they also accrue to imitators and downstream innovators we do not think that is what has been historically meant by we would be pretty surprised if the above criticism meant far as we can tell from the strong resistance this set of propositions still faces more than a decade after they were first published these statements are not widely accepted the propositions may be wrong but they are definitely not is another point in which the reported criticism is perfectly correct ultimately it is an empirical question whether absence or presence of patents distort markets more the is criticism seems unaware of a very long literature in and outside of economics asserting that this is not the case and that as a matter of theory absence of patents distorts markets more than their we have documented there is an long list of empirical economists surprised to learn that in the data patents lowered rather than raised innovation and they have no idea why that might be true the theory of competitive innovation provides a testable answer to this the embodiment is a crucial step in the theoretical argument claiming that competition in the sense of free entry and the right to imitate fosters innovation and economic progress before moving forward to consider recent microeconomic evidence supporting our claim we should briefly explain why the controversy is relevant in the context of our off what is the centers on the fact that technological advances may or may not comp a all alterations page and obtained without embodying them in something material and expensive to either produce or acquire that is in some it physical or human or organizational traditional treatments of the tfp measure describe the latter as completely disembodied and unrelated to investment expenditure most likely this did not correspond to the intuition many researchers had of the nature and causes of tfp certainly it was not what robert solow had in it was the formalism adopted in writing y af k l where y is output a is tfp k is the stock of capital and l is the flow of labor entering the neoclassical production function same is true for the literature we have classified as while some of those arguments would formally go through even if the new technology were embodied in some kind of capital good most models use a disembodied representation of technological progress to formalize their argument there are purely technical reasons for this choice ie deriving a balanced growth path but there are also intuitive and conceptual ones which should be understood as they are relevant for the issue concerning us fundamental link between disembodiment and the view of the world is related to the assumption of unbounded productive capacity that the view needs to make in order to reach its specific conclusions in fact for the will destroy argument to work one must assume that imitators will force bertrand pricing almost immediately for bertrand pricing to make sense one needs a in which each of the competitors is capable of satisfying total demand all alone which requires productive capacity to be instantaneously expandable while one may pretend that the available quantities of physical and human capital of a certain kind ie the kind embodying the new technology can be increased at an infinite speed at no cost this seems in clear violation of the basic economic intuition according to which there is no free lunch in such context the hypothesis that the new idea or technology is actually disembodied and that therefore one can make a very large number of copies of it at no cost and in no time seems necessary to move the argument forward more generally the view according to which ideas once discovered can be immediately copied by anyone at no cost requires conceptually a form of general disembodiment of the idea itself that like a light in the sky appears to and is immediately usable by everyone else were it not for the legal restriction that patents comp a all alterations page papers on public the opposite extreme when a new idea is fully embodied either in an object owned by the creator or in her human capital it is up to her to decide what to do with it and unauthorized imitation becomes if not impossible certainly neither easy nor legal this is the key fact allowing innovators to be rewarded for their inventions even in the absence of the specific privileges that intellectual property introduces matter of fact the theory of competitive innovation rests on the twin hypotheses inventors have control of their inventions and will require appropriate payment to make it available to others imitation is always and everywhere costly because it requires either producing or acquiring the material object or the human capital embodying the two assumptions which we consider most natural imply that productive capacity embodying the new technology will build up only slowly the price of the new good will be determined by demand for quite a while and the position in which price equals average cost will be reached only in the equilibrium of the competitive industry as a consequence competitive rents will be attained by both the innovator and her imitators also in this case one can certainly conceive of circumstances in which such rents could obtain even when the innovation is completely disembodied but those cases appear to be either exceptional or conclusion the theory of competitive innovation rests on the fact that innovations are embodied while symmetrically the view of innovation rests on the fact that innovations are disembodied the latter is a factual issue and it should be resolved empirically inspection of actual innovations fails to deliver as far as we can tell convincing examples of actual innovations that were completely disembodied and could be instantaneously reproduced in an unlimited amount with zero costs of imitation even the commonly used examples of historical relevance if clearly limited given that they were not around until a couple of decades ago fail the test unless the original creator voluntarily releases the master copy of the digital good in question making a large number of copies of it available to consumers is technically impossible even assuming the machines through which reproduction and distribution of digital goods take comp a all alterations page and are costless which they are not in a world of free competition creators will charge a price to release the master copy to imitators and in equilibrium with free entry it is easy to show that such a price will be equal to the net present value of all future rents boldrin and levine applied statistical literature on this argument is very large and our reading is that since zvi dissertation hybrid corn an exploration in the economics of technological change it leans almost completely in favor of the embodiment hypothesis it should be pointed out here that robert solow himself with whom many people tend to associate the idea of always squarely supported the view that the quantitatively relevant type of technological progress is in fact embodied in one form of capital or any case this is not the appropriate place to engage in a full survey of the embodiment controversy even if it may be the place to point out that an updated and careful of the debate would be most welcome in light of its fundamental relevance when it comes to modeling innovation we will therefore limit ourselves to summarizing the findings of a recent of this issue which uses an original and very powerful dataset and that is one of the few to address squarely the questions that concern us ie the empirical relevance of external from technological innovation across competing and ornaghi make use of an unbalanced dataset of spanish manufacturing firms observed with annual frequency during the period this dataset proves to be particularly suitable for disentangling the impact of specific individual sources of productivity growth as it includes detailed observations on outputs inputs proportion of skilled employees types of capital investment undertaken and modifications of the production processes moreover a unique feature of this dataset is that it provides growth rates of prices for outputs and intermediary inputs thus allowing for the construction of a more reliable measure of productivity estimation builds up progressively from a simple regression that reveals a large and unexplained residual representing the unweighted average tfp growth across firms traditionally this is taken as a measure of technological their comp a all alterations page papers on public is to show that using the listed above one can show it is actually accounted for by very embodied investments in some kind of capital to this end they start by analyzing the contributions of traditional disembodied variables as sources of average tfp growth they consider lbd and unpriced externalities such as those acting through aggregate human capital and the spillovers of from firm to quantitative role played by such variables in accounting for at the firm level is often argued to be strong evidence possibly the strongest in favor of the theory of innovation and growth because this theory says technological progress is mostly disembodied and generates large externalities at no explicit cost to the recipients patents are necessary to allow inventors to make their products excludable therefore appropriating at least part of their social returns without patents private of the returns from innovative investments would become impossible and the value of the innovation for the innovator would dissipate through the external effects induced by free and ornaghi replicate in their dataset the well known earlier results showing that certain aggregate variables interpreted as the source of disembodied technological progress and unpriced externalities are correlated to average tfp growth at the industry they take into account the relevance of human and physical technological progress as an engine of tfp measure the impact of new capital goods on tfp by means of two variables the average vintage of the physical capital and an index of new technology usage they account for differences in human capital using two variables firm wages and the percentage of employees at the firm level to deal with classical endogeneity issues they estimate a specification with the ratio of skilled workers at the firm level instead of firm wages once the measures of embodied technological progress are considered the variables that capture lbd human capital externalities and spillovers no longer show any relevance in affecting average tfp growth either at the firm or industry level in other words once they account for variations in physical and human capital that are measurable at the firm level the external effects completely evaporate and are no longer relevant in even statistically the movements in comp a all alterations page and in fact castiglionesi and ornaghi find that embodied variables alone can fully explain average tfp growth across firms and industries last but not least in all specifications constant returns to scale cannot be in order to better assess lbd and to look more carefully into the presence of potentially external effects they consider two alternative measures that arguably are closer in spirit to the theoretical idea behind lbd cumulative output since the introduction of a and time after the introduction of a these two variables should capture the idea that a change in the methods and techniques used for production must trigger a new learning cycle of the workforce at the firm considered together with the embodied variables these alternative measures of lbd retain explanatory power this is coherent with the classical definition of lbd internal to the firm and due to the adoption of new processes in other words there is no evidence of unpriced spillovers in this results taken together with those relative to the embodiment of tfp cast a long shadow on the idea that spillover effects external to the firm play a major role in technological progress and in the increase of tfp along the lines assumed in the up castiglionesi and findings prove that things such as and technological generated via a chain of external spillovers from one firm to another find scant support in actual microeconomic and technological change appear to originate at the level and are mostly embodied in their investment decisions which are therefore both costly and internal average tfp growth is fully explained by the kind of technical progress that is embodied in actual physical and human capital neutral or disembodied technical change plays virtually no new have already seen in section that contrary to what received wisdom keeps repeating the available empirical evidence about the statistical relation between measures of competition and patents point to a positive link more competition more highly cited comp a all alterations page papers on public still because we have also seen that patents and their citations are poor predictors of productivity growth these results imply relatively little with respect to the policy issue at stake does competition foster productivity growth more or less than the aim of replicating test on more recent micro data we have constructed a dataset that includes among other measures patent counts and patent citations for digit sic code industries over the period and productivity growth for digit naics code industries over the period the raw data used to construct this dataset come from different and financial data available in compustat are matched with data on patents retrieved from the data described by hall jaffe and trajtenberg total output data for sic manufacturing industries are taken from the nber and us census center for economic studies ces manufacturing industry database described by bartelsman and gray information on output inputs and productivity for naics manufacturing industries are obtained from the we retrieve information on us imports at sic and naics industry level from the us department of commerce and the us international trade commission the accounting data retrieved from compustat include sales s item gross capital k item operating profits op item and advertising expenditure a item for the period the data we use refer to all firms in the manufacturing sector this includes firms divided in according to the digit sic large dataset allows us to construct more accurate measures of innovation and competition and to test the robustness of our findings when different outcomes are used to capture technological change and productivity growth specifically innovation is measured with two different sets of variables the first set consists of number of patents and number of citations received by those opposed to a simple patent count citations can capture not only the quantity of ideas produced but also the quality of those main advantages of patents compared to other indicators are that they provide a measure of successful research output and they are objective in so far as they are not influenced by accounting practices at the same time there are a number of limitations in measuring innovation through patents which we have already discussed and documented in section above as we showed there comp a all alterations page and and citations measure only a relatively tiny fraction of the actual output of innovative activity moreover patents cannot account for efficiency gains due to the adoption of the most efficient technologies and best managerial practices as long as these are not patented nor can they account for the increased productivity that follows the introduction of new goods and services not covered by with the discussion carried out in sections and and in order to overcome these limitations and to provide a check of robustness of our findings the second variable we use to capture technological advances refers to productivity growth computed either as tfp or as labor productivity for different naics manufacturing industries over the period as calculated on the basis of either nber or bls output data competition is an index based on the profitability of the industry and takes values from low profits to high the basis of the data so organized first we have replicated and extended the empirical model discussed in section see correa with innovation patents or patent citations on the side and competition inverse of profitability on the line with the theoretical arguments developed in section as well as with the empirical results discussed in section we find a positive relationship that is remarkably robust to changes in industry sic vs naics time sample period and set of sampled industries manufacturing vs all then that the traditional measures of innovations are our dataset very much like those considered in section correlated with the most natural index of competitive pressure we moved next to the issue that is most important for us ie the correlation between the latter and objective measures of productivity growth the next two figures figures and are based on naics industries for the period figure to suggest that when one regresses productivity growth on the inverse of profitability the relationship that had been pushed out the door in the case of patents strikes back with a when studying labor productivity as amply discussed in correa and ornaghi and hashmi the inverse of profitability is clearly an endogenous outcome that depends among other things on the ability of comp a all alterations page papers on public productivity growth and competition figure productivity growth and competition figure productivity growth and lagged competition figure productivity growth and lagged competition firms in each sector to reduce costs and increase prices through innovations that increase labor deal with this problem figure is obtained by regressing labor productivity growth on lagged inverse profitability ie on comp a all alterations page and productivity growth and lagged competition sectorial productivity growth and lagged competition sectorial sectorial competition during the previous period change has a dramatic effect from an we move to a clear positive relationship and a very robust one as the tests reported in correa and ornaghi result is confirmed when the observations are aggregated sector by sector and the regression is performed using the sectorial averages on both sides of the equality sign if possible the positive relationship displayed in figure is more pronounced than that in figure is worth stressing that because of the interval of variation of productivity growth as reported in figure may incorrectly appear as exceedingly small this is not the case when expressed in percentage points per year the effect of increased competition is actually quite strong once the few very monopolized sectors in which our index of competition is lower than are dropped the actual lower bound is a growth rate of percent per year recall that these are sectorial averages and the upper bound is percent in other words the average annual growth of productivity in the sectors with the highest level of competition is up to bigger than in the sectors with the lowest level of competition these are strikingly large differences when cumulated over various decades as is the case in our comp a all alterations page papers on public open issues and theory is ambiguous when it comes to assessing if either competition and free entry or patent protection and the monopoly power it induces define the best institutional environment to foster innovation and technological progress the empirical evidence though is overwhelming far from fostering and stimulating innovation and productivity growth patents are likely to hamper them while free entry and competition appear to be at least correlated with if not to cause labor productivity and tfp growth this has an obvious implication there are no objective reasons whatsoever to strengthen patents any further than we have already done in fact it seems urgent to begin undoing some of the damage we have been doing to ourselves over the last years and work to slowly but surely the overall system of intellectual the system is neither politically easy nor is it obvious at least to us which steps are appropriate and in which order they should be undertaken matter of fact the number of empirical studies that have carried out well designed counterfactual exercises capable of assessing how an alternative legal system would affect innovative activity and which parts of the current one are the most damaging to technological progress is exceedingly small what this means is that the very first policy goal may just be that of advocating supporting and carrying out well designed empirical studies of how innovation and technological progress fare across sectors countries and time periods under different legal and incentive systems our basic intuition grounded on the research either presented or referred to here is that the current systems of intellectual property are to the trade restrictions in existence until a few decades ago and their dismantlement should be approached in the very same fashion piece by piece and quite do not have therefore any grand strategy to propose but just a short list of general goals plus a few somewhat more specific ones in those particular areas where we believe economic analysis has managed to dig deeper because policy proposals are better digested and metabolized when served in the form of small pills here is our stop the tide that since the early s is both extending the set of that can be patented and shifting comp a all alterations page and legal and judicial balance more and more in favor of patent because competition fosters productivity growth antitrust and competition policies should be seen as key tools to foster innovation this is of particular relevance for sectors from software to bioengineering to medical products and free trade is a key part of competition policies hence the role that the world trade organization world intellectual property organization and trade related aspects of intellectual property rights agreement play should be redefined to move away from the current approach to free trade in goods and ideas the aim here should be that of stopping the policy of exporting our intellectual policy laws to other countries while adopting a policy of exporting free trade and competition in innovation this seems to us an urgent goal because within a couple of decades the of trade in between the united states and europe on one hand and asia on the other may easily reverse at that point the temptation to engage in of may well affect the asian countries leading to a general increase in intellectual property protection variation in the importance of patents suggests we may want to start tailoring patent length and breadth to different sectorial needs substantial empirical work needs to be done to implement this properly even if there already exists a vast legal literature pointing in this reverse the burden of proof patents should be allowed only when monopoly power is justified by evidence about fixed costs and actual lack of appropriability the operational model should be that of patents should be awarded only when strictly needed on economic use prizes and competition to nurture innovation an interesting approach is to change the role that the national science foundation and the national institutes of health play in fostering innovation the basic goal in this case is that of reversing the principle according to which federally financed investigation can lead to private patents as a first step we would advocate going back to the old rule according to which the comp a all alterations page papers on public of federally subsidized research cannot lead to the creation of new private monopolies but should be available to all market participants this goal is particularly important in the pharmaceutical with regard to the pharmaceutical industry we advocate reforming pharmaceutical regulation to either treat stage ii and iii clinical trials as public goods to be financed by a competitive basis or by allowing the commercialization at regulated prices equal to the economic costs of drugs that satisfy the food and drug administration requirements for safety even if they do not yet satisfy the current requisites for proving efficacy it is ensuring the not the safety of drugs that is most expensive and difficult all the usual mechanisms of ensuring the safety of drugs would remain firmly in place while pharmaceutical companies would be requested to sell new drugs at until efficacy is proved they could start selling at market prices after that in this way companies would face strong incentives to conduct or fund appropriate efficacy studies where they deem the potential market for such drugs to be large enough to bear the additional costs at the same time this approval system would give cures for rare diseases the fighting chance they currently do not have this solution would substantially reduce the risks and cost of developing new if this progressive approval approach works for rare diseases there is no reason it should not be adopted across the current system favors a small number of blockbuster drugs that can be sold to millions of patients the coming revolution in medicine will rely on carefully targeting hundreds or even thousands of drugs to the correct patients but lawmakers must first usher in a new system that makes developing these precision treatments possible the regulation reform we are suggesting here would be a first important step to achieve such finally software patents are a particularly egregious and bad form of intellectual property for a sector where we also have very detailed micro evidence about the role of patents in not promoting innovation see eg bessen and meurer and comp a all alterations page and citations and labor productivity growth right panel excludes the top percent of performers figure citations and labor productivity growth right panel excludes the top percent of performers references the same arguments are likely to apply to and genetic research at large the goal of policy in these cases should be just that of slowly but surely decreasing the strength of intellectual property a and a reproduce the above figures and respectively with each naics number appended to its data point this should allow the interested reader to make up his mind about the extent to which sector by sector patent citations counts are or are not a good proxy for those factors that in practice do increase productivity we remind readers that these are averages over the year period a and a are from the same dataset they have labor and tfp growth on the vertical axes respectively and citations growth on the horizontal axes there is no correlation in either should allow for a better

the about the economics of innovation as a part of his schooling i approached the of michele boldrin and david levine with some was also intrigued this paper with coauthors juan correa and carmine ornaghi hereafter bclo discusses those theoretical arguments presents empirical evidence and draws out the policy implications while i think they make a convincing case for dismantling the patent system i do find parts of the argument theories of technological change in the introduction to his article in the journal of political economy paul romer articulates what i think of as the received wisdom it starts with a careful account of the production output is produced with factors of production unskilled labor skilled labor machinery etc technology is the recipe book for how to combine these ingredients the factors of production to produce goods that we like in principle you could always make twice as much of any good currently making by using twice the quantity of each ingredient you need a new recipe to do that similarly with the same recipe anyone else could produce more of what you are currently making a recipe is said to be as any number of people can use it simultaneously why in a competitive equilibrium all the revenue from production is paid to the factors of production with nothing left to pay for the studies have shown that the growth of factors of production leaves much to be explained in accounting for economic growth it seems that the recipes must be getting better and casual observation for example using a new smart phone supports that view since technological change appears to be a crucial source of comp a all alterations page and living standards yet a competitive market provide incentives for inventive activity we are fortunate to have institutions that fill the gap the patent system is one of them allowing the owner of a patented recipe to restrict its use by others the patent holder gets some monopoly power the expectation of monopoly profit is an incentive to invent new could be wrong with this received wisdom the starting point of the is the observation that it can be difficult to separate the recipe from the chef new techniques are often embodied in people or machines it takes time and effort to train people or build machines while a component of the technique may be in principle it may not be easy to replicate in practice the good techniques end up being used by some and not by others a consequence is that there can be rents to the inventor of a new technique even in the absence of patent starting point is quite compelling and is in fact a common view of technology a recent paper by robert lucas while not modeling any payments envisions the diffusion of techniques in this way a technique only spreads from one individual to another via a chance meeting and an ensuing transfer of information from one brain to the note that techniques are goods in this economy but because they are embodied in individuals the good techniques instantaneously replicated in this economy one could imagine that an individual with knowledge of a good technique might put a price on the service of teaching it to someone arguments become less abstract with a specific example in mind consider a new technique for folding metal into various shapes without weakening it the idea behind it is a good engineer could look at it get the idea and decide how it could be put to use in his manufacturing process without patent protection the inventor of this technique would seem to have no means of extracting any return from it but actually adopting the new process of folding metal requires specialized machinery and training of engineers the inventor knows how to make it work but the potential users do not it is not hard to see how even in the absence of a patent the inventor could profit from manufacturers who hire him as a consultant to get the process up and comp a all alterations page papers on public challenge for empirical with these two scenarios and their starkly different policy implications for the patent system how can we use data to resolve the issue in principle like to build an economic model that encompasses these two scenarios the model would also incorporate features of the current patent system as well as other mechanisms inventors use to appropriate returns such as trade secrecy we would then confront this model with microeconomic data of various sorts in order to estimate the relevant parameters finally using these estimates of the parameters we would perform various counterfactual simulations of the model to examine the outcomes for economic growth and economic welfare under various possible reforms of the patent system we could then make policy recommendations with some confidence based on such a systematic quantitative to reality while a worthy goal we have a long way to go before we can carry out such a research agenda in a satisfactory manner in the meantime left looking at correlations between measures of productivity patents firm size and competition measured as the inverse of we have to be pretty cautious about what we can conclude from such correlations about the worthiness of either scenario the implications for patent policy are even more some cases the mapping from the empirical findings to the different models of innovation is not very clear the received wisdom is not that large firms are the most inventive as formalized in economic models all the innovation is done by new entrants similarly since the models associated with the received wisdom typically assume free entry into research activity it is not clear that the industries with more research activity will appear less competitive more in these models profits get used up paying for paper is quite right on the other hand to point to the weak connection between productivity growth and patenting it is a puzzle on many levels that the industries with more inventive activity do not experience much more rapid productivity this puzzle persists if you replace patents with in his presidential address to the american economic association zvi griliches dwelled on this issue figure in his paper gives roughly the same message as figures in comp a all alterations page and are these relationships so weak griliches pointed to the difficulty of measuring productivity there are also conceptual industry experiencing technological improvements will typically expand into less productive activities so that the expansion itself may dampen measured productivity growth this point is carefully worked out in a recent paper by arnaud costinot dave donaldson and ivana komunjer empirical work in the paper is a useful reminder that we ought to be humble given how little we know in this field the authors suggest that the weakness of the evidence in favor of the received wisdom means that there is little justification for our current patent system given our limited knowledge i think the appropriate response is to be very cautious in recommending dramatic changes in that promising critique of the empirical work in the paper may appear unconstructive what is a good way of determining which view of innovation and competition is more reasonable short of the rather heroic approach i laid out in the beginning how else might we use data to answer the important question of how we can best reform the patent system i see at least three useful lines of examining the key premises of the economic heresy exploiting macro evidence on reform conducting case studies on how actual inventors and users of new technology interact with the patent consider each of these in economic heresy view is built on the premise that technology while is not easy to replicate that premise appears very solid but ripe for empirical exploration at the macro level it relates to why many countries are not exploiting the micro level it relates to why technologies spread example even took a long time to spread across the united states as graphically illustrated in holmes but what is it that holds things back is it that technology is inherently costly to replicate generating rents to inventors or is it that users either comp a all alterations page papers on public or producers are resistant to new technology thus reducing the discounted flow of profits to inventors a better understanding of this phenomenon of slow replication seems central to the issues of this paper and economics more countries have recently strengthened patent these changes have been driven by internal pressure from their own inventors and sometimes by external pressure from developing countries who want their intellectual property protected in either case these changes provide a laboratory within which to study the consequences of changing the patent system while frederic scherer is mentioned in bclo as buying into the received wisdom i have seen him point to evidence that when italy adopted stronger pharmaceutical patents their pharmaceutical industry in this area case studies can be extremely valuable in preparing for this discussion i had a long conversation with my cousin max w durney the inventor of the technology for folding metal that i mentioned above on the basis of this invention which is protected with numerous patents he founded the company industrial origami he argues that his extensive use of patents was crucial in attracting financing financing was itself necessary to invest in developing the technology and in marketing it to manufacturers who were initially resistant to adopting a new process the current patent system while not without problems can enable creative individuals to make a career inventing new a d donaldson and i komunjer goods do countries

economy comp a all alterations page and atkeson is the stanley m zimmerman professor of economics and finance at the university of california los boldrin and david levine in previous work and now in this paper with juan and carmine ornaghi have issued a powerful challenge to the idea that patent protection plays an essential role in fostering technological innovation and improved welfare for consumers in fact these authors go further at times and argue that patent protection may in fact hinder rather than help technological authors start this paper with the premise that it is a straightforward task to construct economic models such that patent protection improves welfare when the parameters are in one region and reduces welfare when the parameters are in another region they argue that as a result the question of whether patent policy has a beneficial or harmful effect on innovation and consumer welfare must be resolved on the basis of empirical evidence rather than theory in this paper the authors aim to shed some light on the empirical link between patents competition and technological anticipate that in his discussion commenter sam kortum will assess the contribution of this paper to the broader empirical literature on the relationship between patenting innovation and technological progress given the dictates of comparative advantage i will specialize in my discussion on the theoretical basis for arguing that patent protection may be harmful rather than helpful to innovation and welfare i agree with the basic premise of the authors that the idea that patents are essential to support innovation in equilibrium is deeply ingrained in many and minds while many practitioners would argue that there are important flaws in patent policy as currently implemented in the comp a all alterations page papers on public states see eg shapiro the authors of this paper look to go further and argue that the property rights conferred by patent protection even if executed well may be harmful to innovation and welfare this view is the the authors refer to in their introduction given the strength of the theoretical arguments i see my best chance of adding value to this debate is to sketch a simple theoretical model of innovation with and without patent protection to see how straightforward it is to have the welfare implications of patents go either goal in sketching this model is to capture some of the ideas the authors discuss in their paper about the difference between innovation and imitation and the role of a advantage for innovators of some kind in supporting innovation without patent protection in a way that complements the previous theoretical work by these authors the authors are certainly correct that the theoretical work assessing the impact of patent policy in general equilibrium in the growth literature is too special and narrow and that much more theoretical and empirical work needs to be done what follows is a small contribution in that central idea i would like to illustrate with this model is that in an economy with imperfect competition incumbent firms built on a successful innovation already have strategies available to preempt entry by imitating firms even in the absence of patent a theoretical matter it is not at all clear that welfare is improved if we enhance the strategic position of these incumbents by granting them patent protection as an additional tool to deter entry of competing model i use to illustrate this point starts with a demand structure in which we can say that some products are closer substitutes than others so that we can think about oligopoly in a particular market nested in a larger general equilibrium economy as a do so posit a nested demand system with a continuum of potential sectors and many but countable potential goods within each sector a firm innovates by being the first to introduce a good into a particular sector to innovate a firm must pay a high fixed cost to introduce this first good in the sector a firm imitates by being the second or later to introduce a good into a particular sector an imitator benefits from following an innovator into a sector in that the imitator pays a lower fixed cost to introduce this additional good in the comp a all alterations page and be more specific let aggregate consumption be a constant elasticity of substitution aggregate ces across sectors n y yj is the output of sector j and n is the measure of sectors that have active firms producing goods in those sectors the is the elasticity of substitution across sector inputs in producing final consumption standard arguments give that the induced demand by final consumption producers for the output of sector j is given by the ces inverse demand function pj pj is the price index for output of sector j and p is the price index for final consumption in sector j is a second ces aggregate across the output of the kj firms active in that sector q qjk is the output of the k th firm in sector j and is the elasticity of substitution across goods within the sector to capture the idea that goods within a sector are closer substitutes than goods in different sectors assume that with this ranking of elasticities we have the inverse demand curve for a particular good given by pjk pjk is the price of the k th good in sector j and the price index for the sector pk is constructed in the standard consider some simple economics of decisions to innovate and imitate when facing this demand structure the returns to either of these decisions will depend on the number of firms that introduce goods in a particular sector assume that when it comes comp a all alterations page papers on public to produce firms active in a sector engage in price bertrand competition with a finite number of goods in a sector the perceived elasticity of residual demand for each firm in a sector and hence the markup over marginal cost charged by that firm depends on that share of the market in that sector if there are no imitators that follow an innovating firm into a particular sector then that innovating firm enjoys a high profit from its innovation not only because it commands the entire market but also because it charges a high markup corresponding to the low elasticity of substitution sectors if many imitators follow an innovating firm into a sector each firm has a small market share in the sector and markups are small corresponding to the high perceived elasticity of residual demand for each firm as determined by a firm that innovates pays an entry cost c while a firm that imitates pays an entry costs c with c c patents necessary to support innovation in this answer to this question depends on the cost of imitation is zero and there are potential profits for an imitator ie then the answer is yes we cannot have an equilibrium in which an incumbent innovator earns the positive profits necessary to recoup the innovation cost c without attracting entry from imitators this particular parameter configuration corresponds to the standard assumption that imitation is truly costless and in this special case it is likely impossible to support innovation in equilibrium without some regulation of imitation such as patent protection as the authors of this paper correctly point out this special case of zero imitation costs likely lies at the heart of most thinking by policymakers about intellectual general is this argument for patent protection not for example the case in which goods within a sector are perfect substitutes and imitation costs are positive c this case with goods within a sector being perfect substitutes this dependence of elasticities on market shares arises as a result of the assumption that there are only a finite number of goods kj being produced in any given a result firms must take into account that the price that they choose affects the sectoral price index pj and thus overall demand for the sectoral output yj in addition to the share of spending in the sector on their specific good in contrast with a continuum of sectors individual firms take the overall consumption price index level of consumption c as comp a all alterations page and by a second firm as an imitator in a sector eliminates all profits for both the innovator and the imitator by driving prices down to marginal cost through bertrand competition here there are no returns to imitation all firms prefer to innovate in a new sector and enjoy monopoly profits in that sector rather than imitate in this extreme case innovators here are protected from imitation as long as there is some cost to imitation similar logic holds that patent protection is also unnecessary if imitation costs are equal to innovation costs c c regardless of the elasticity between goods in a sector in these cases adding patent protection to the economy has no impact on equilibrium innovation and these special cases the impact of patent protection on innovation and welfare is easy to see what happens however for more general values of imitation costs relative to innovation costs c c and elasticities across sectors and goods are the impacts of patent policy on innovation imitation and consumer welfare purely a problem of parameter values in this more general case or are there some more general lessons we might draw even in this simple is impossible to give a fully answer to these questions without specifying the details of the model of entry and the competition between innovators and imitators but i conjecture that older ideas about how innovators might preempt entry by imitators in the absence of patent protection may well be useful for drawing more general conclusions about the impact of patents on welfare the key economic idea to note is that even in the absence of patent protection an innovating firm in a particular sector has a first mover advantage in that it can use product proliferation through imitation of its own products as a strategy to simultaneously maintain monopoly profits with high markups in equilibrium and to effectively deter entry by imitating firms that might seek to compete with it in the this idea that firms in a market with imperfect competition will choose to avoid competing with each other in equilibrium is a one in economics see for example prescott and vogel see ellison for recent work documenting how pharmaceutical companies use product proliferation as a strategic device to deter entry by generics as the expiration of their patent protection comp a all alterations page papers on public basic idea is as follows a single firm that has paid both the innovation cost c for the first good in a sector and the imitation cost c for additional goods in that same sector can charge a high markup for all of those goods by setting high prices and low quantities in a coordinated fashion across its product line if there are no other imitators in the sector and at the same time credibly convince any potential imitators that the competitive outcome that would emerge if that firm were actually to enter the sector would be very unfavorable to that firm because it would have such a small market share essentially an innovator has the strategic incentive to build on his own innovation through imitation to fill up the sector with his own products in contrast if a new firm considers entry into the sector through imitation it faces the prospect of competition with the original innovator as an incumbent in a powerful can we conjecture about equilibrium in an economy of this kind in which an innovator can obtain patent protection for his innovation that is broad enough in scope to prevent imitation by other firms looking to introduce goods into the sector here patents may well serve the imitation preemption role for innovators that product proliferation serves in the economy without patents what are the implications of this comparison between an economy without patents and with patents for product creation and welfare with patents innovators will clearly charge high prices and enjoy monopoly profits just as in the equilibrium without patents so in this respect the two economies might look similar with patents however innovating firms will not feel the competitive pressure from the threat of imitation by other firms to introduce additional products into the sector that they have innovated in and hence consumers will not benefit from the additional and relatively cheap product creation that occurs in the economy without patents when innovating firms fill up their sector with products to deter entry hence by introducing patent protection for innovators policymakers will in fact have reduced one incentive for product creation without increasing other incentives to innovate sufficiently to deliver a compensating increase of entry into new overall impact of patent protection on welfare would depend on the general equilibrium reallocation of products across sectors and would require a much fuller analysis of a fully specified model but the possibilities that patent protection may be a drag on the comp a all alterations page and of new products should be clear from the arguments laid out here what is even clearer is that the economic thinking on this topic has not been well fleshed out in the academic literature the

text of a regulatory document fcc report on street view google is faulted for impeding us inquiry on data april the report prepared by the federal communications commission a month investigation of street view project was heavily redacted two weeks ago although it found that google had violated any laws the agency said google had obstructed inquiry and fined the company on saturday google released a version of the report with names the full version draws a portrait of a company where an engineer easily embark on a project to gather personal and web of potentially hundreds of millions of people as part of his or unscheduled work time and where privacy concerns are shrugged the payload data was secretly collected between and as part of street view a project to photograph streetscapes over of the civilized world when the program was being designed the says it included the following to do item discuss considerations with product that never occurred the report google says the data collection was legal but when regulators asked see what had been collected google refused the report says saying might break privacy and wiretapping laws if it shared the a google spokeswoman said saturday that the company had much privacy controls than it used to in part because of the street controversy she expressed the hope that with the release of the report we can now put this matter behind ever since information about the secret data collection first began emerge two years ago google has portrayed it as the mistakes of unauthorized engineer operating on his own and stressed that the was never used in any google the report quoting the original proposal gives a different impression the data the engineer wrote would be offline for use in other initiatives google says this was never the report which was first published in its unredacted form by the angeles times also states that the engineer who began the project part of his percent time that google gives employees to do work their own initiative specifically told two engineers working on project including a senior manager about collecting payload as early as the report says street view engineers had access to the plan to collect payload data five engineers tested street view code a sixth reviewed it line by line and a seventh worked on it the report privacy advocates said the full report put google in a bad rogue engineer scenario collapses in light of the fact others were aware of the project and did not object said rotenberg executive director of the electronic privacy center this is what happens in the absence of enforcement and absence of the street view program used special cars outfitted with google first said it was just photographing streets and did disclose that it was collecting internet communications called data transmitted over networks until may when it confronted by german eventually it was forced to reveal that the information it collected could include the full text of sites visited other even if a user was not working on a computer at the moment the view car slowly passed if the device was on and the network unencrypted all sorts of information about what the user had doing could be scooped up data experts so how did this happen quite simply it was a mistake a executive wrote on a company blog in the project leaders not want and had no intention of using payload but according to the report the engineer suggested in his that it was entirely intentional we are logging user traffic with sufficient data to precisely triangulate their position at a time along with information about what they were attending to paperwork did not seem to be a high priority managers of the street view project told fcc investigators that never read the proposal called a design document a manager of street view said he preapproved the document before it more than a dozen countries began investigations of street view in the united states the justice department

this document is intended for programmers who want to write applications that can interact with picasa web a reference document it assumes that you understand the presented in the guide and the general ideas the google data web albums feed picasa web albums provides a variety of representations of photo data there are three independent axes for what you want when you request data visibility projection visibility values let you request data at various levels of for example a visibility value of public requests publicly data for a list of values see visibility values below default visibility depends on whether the request is authenticated not and on whether the requester is the owner or projection values let you indicate what elements and extensions appear in the feed requesting for example a projection of base indicates that the representation is a basic atom feed any extension elements suitable for display in an atom reader for list of values see projection values below you must specify projection path and kind values let you indicate what type of items you information about for example a path of and a kind value tag requests a feed of tags associated with the user whose username liz path and kind values are separate parts of the uri but used together to indicate the item desired for a list of values see path values below for a list of kind values kind values below you must specify a path but kind is the default kind depends on the to request a particular representation you specify a visibility a projection value and a path and kind in the uri that you send picasa web the uri of a representation of a picasa web albums feed takes following httpaddr for example the following uri is for a feed listing a albums the projection is api which requests a full feed with relevant extension elements and the visibility is private requests only albums that publicly httpaddr if you specify a visibility value then the visibility depends who the requester is for authenticated requests from the owner default is all for authenticated requests from a as well for unauthenticated requests the default is the projection value is as a developer usually want to use the api projection normally use only two of the visibility levels all or for an authenticated feed instead of specifying a user id you specify the special value default which tells picasa web albums to the user id and password that you provided during some feed types are that is you can post new data to and edit or delete existing data while others are feeds include a httpaddr element to tell you to post new events and entries in feeds include or link the following table describes the supported visibility note that there are three kinds of requests authenticated from the owner authenticated requests from a unauthenticated visibility description security all shows all data both public and private requires default for the owner and only the owner can specify this private shows only private data requires authentication only owner can specify this public shows only public data does not require authentication often used by an authenticated user to see only the publicly photos corresponding to view my public gallery in the picasa albums visible shows all data the user has access to including both public photos or albums and any photos or albums that the owner explicitly given the authenticated user rights to using not require authentication default for unauthenticated requests for for unauthenticated requests this is the same public for authenticated this returns the data that owner has given them access to for authenticated requests from owner this is the same as although the examples in this documentation use only the projection picasa web albums also supports a base projection for by feed the following table describes the supported projection projection name description api feed including all relevant gphoto extension elements properties contain plain text not html if user is owner of the base basic atom feed without any extension elements its and properties contain html there are three basic types of feeds you indicate which type you want by specifying a path each of those types you can additionally specify which kind or of associated data you note each path includes a user id which is an id associated with google account the user id can be either a username or an address so it may or may not include an sign and a domain the feed represents data associated with a particular a feed can contain either album or tag or photo or kinds which you can request using the kind to retrieve a feed you can make a request to appropriate feed httpaddr the feed represents data associated with a contacts a feed can currently contain entries of the kind user it is a to retrieve a feed you can make a request to appropriate feed httpaddr the feed represents an album and any kinds associated the album an feed can contain either photo or tag which you can request using the kind to retrieve an feed you can make a request to appropriate feed url to retrieve an album by httpaddr the feed provides a list of comments or tags with the specified to retrieve a feed send a request to the appropriate url specifying the album either by id or by httpaddr search the community search feed allows for searching all public photos the feed is similar to that of an to retrieve a community search feed send a request to the feed url specifying the q query parameter and httpaddr photos the featured photos feed allows you to retrieve a feed of the featured photos on picasa web httpaddr the kind parameter lets you request information about a particular of item the parameter value should be a list requested if you omit the kind parameter picasa web albums chooses a kind depending on the level of feed requesting for a feed the default kind is album for an feed the kind is photo for a feed the default kind is comment a community search feed the default kind is note you edit comments or tags sending a put to the edit uri a comment or tag entry has no the following table describes the supported kind kind description supported album feed includes some or all of the albums the specified user has their gallery which albums are returned depends on the value specified photo feed includes the photos in an album recent uploaded by a user or photos uploaded by all community and community search comment feed includes the comments that have been made on a and tag includes all tags associated with the specified user album photo for and feeds the tags include a value indicating how often they occurred user feed includes entries representing users web albums query parameters picasa web albums

specified thumbsize thumbnail size parameter valid with album or photo specifies what image size to use for thumbnails multiple values may specified using a list if multiple values specified multiple elements will be returned in feed refer to the list of valid values the following values are valid for the thumbsize and imgmax parameters and are embeddable on a webpage these images are as both and sizes by appending c or u to size as an example to retrieve a pixel image that is cropped would specify c while to retrieve the uncropped image you specify u for the thumbsize or imgmax query parameter the following values are valid for the thumbsize and imgmax parameters and are embeddable on a webpage these images are as only sizes by appending u to the size or just the size value without appending there is an additional size d which results in the elements referencing the original uploaded photo including original exif data it is valid only for use with the imgmax these query parameters are used when retrieving the feeds in order get images of the appropriate sizes they cannot be used retrieving the actual images example url using the imgmax httpaddr picasa web albums from flash you can retrieve a picasa web albums crossdomainxml file from following httpaddr each of the feeds normally accessible with a base prefix httpaddr are also accessible with the new url of

see the media note despite the name media rss the picasa web albums data api elements from the media namespace in both atom and rss picasa web albums uses the following media as usual in the google data api documentation a question mark after attribute name indicates that the attribute is optional almost all the attributes we list for media elements are contains the url and other information about the full version of media the element appears as a child of a there can be multiple elements for a for example a video may have element that specifies a representation of the video and a element that specifies the url of the video attribute url the url of the full version of the media for the current type the mime type of the medium either image or video somewhat redundant as type contains more specific mime type but medium may be simpler for the client height the height of the image or video represented by width the width of the image or video represented by filesize the file size in

tiny follow wired mozilla gets down to business with do you really need a password you can barely data center engineer shares secrets of by cade email luiz barroso one of the minds behind the googlenet photo luiz barroso see data centers as data he sees them as computers the size of barroso is a distinguished engineer at google and a researcher at the once and future computer giants compaq and equipment corp he helped pioneer multicore microprocessors that are actually many chips and together with urs man who oversaw the development of worldwide network computing facilities he wrote the definitive book on data center design called the datacenter as a computer it explains why massive internet applications run on ordinary collection of servers the entire data center including many servers must be built to work as a these new large data centers are quite different from hosting facilities of earlier times barroso and wrote portions of the hardware and software resources in these must work in concert to efficiently deliver good levels of service performance something that can only be achieved by a approach to their design and deployment in other words we must the data center itself as one massive the trick is to split your massive application into tiny pieces spread them evenly across the array of servers each server is just piece of computer if you do this right you need powerful servers in fact barroso says better to use machines with modest processors spreading your application as thin you can modest machines are cheaper and potentially and if you spread the load thin enough ie use more servers better prepared when any one machine in the seven or eight years since google first put this idea action it has inspired a revolution among the giants of the net amazon microsoft yahoo and facebook all moving in a direction and now server manufacturers are the idea to extremes building machines that seek to tackle problems using hundreds of chips originally designed for cellphones tablets a company called calxeda offers servers built with chips not unlike the one in your iphone a second startup seamicro is doing much the same with mobile chip the and hp is exploring similar servers with a research effort project luiz barroso applauds these efforts this is just the sort of thing espouses in datacenter as a computer but he also warns that there limits to how thin you can spread your application in response the hype surrounding these cellphone servers he urged pen a to their book a paper that would show parallel computing may not fly if taken too far paper written by and edited by barroso points out that you spread your application thinner and thinner the spreading harder and harder at a certain point he says it may not be worth rise of the google luiz barroso joined google in when the company still leased in ordinary data centers much like the rest of the world he as a software engineer but first vice president engineering soon put him in charge of the effort to rebuild infrastructure including not only the software but hardware i was the closest thing we had to a hardware person running the platforms team he helped google build not its own data centers but its own servers and other hardware over the years reports have indicated that google even builds own network switches and routers barroso declines to specifics google typically says very little about its data seeing them as a competitive advantage as rivals but his is that google builds equipment that fits into its vision of warehouse servers the most powerful on the earth on contrary the whole idea is to make them less powerful modest save money one powerful machine ends up costing more than machines that have the same performance barroso and if you run your application across a wide array of servers it mean as much when one goes down the easiest for a software engineer is to have just one big computer with one so fast that you need other cpus but that computer fail he says having a larger number of small computational gives you an easier way of tackling the in building servers with hundreds of chips companies such calxeda and seamicro are merely extending this idea splitting tasks into even smaller pieces seamicro ceo andrew feldman cites datacenter as a computer as an influence meanwhile academics such dave andersen and steve swanson have shown that such systems can large applications while consuming considerably less power anderson calls his research system the fast array of wimpy nodes at least among the research community the wimpy name has stuck the nodes are wimpy only on their own if you put enough of together quite or at least powerful when paired with the right google takes it with warehouse computer the software is as much a part of whole as the hardware indeed that massive array of servers perform to its potential unless the software is built to use the problem is that building software for a parallel system is difficult than building it for a single machine and difficulty only increases as you break your application into tinier tinier pieces and spread it across wimpier and wimpier easy parallelism but then harder barroso says there are some parts of a program that are trivial chunk into pieces that necessarily have to interact with other but eventually exhausted this and you have to go to other pieces of the code that are hard to there comes a point barroso says when just not worth it to going you run into law which says that if parallelize only part of a system your performance will improve so much paper was called brawny cores still beat cores most of the time and law was at the heart of law is a way of mathematically expressing that unless are perfectly parallelizable there will always been a pretty on how much faster you can make a computer by just more parallel processing barroso tells us a very cruel you revoke it if ten percent of your problem is parallelizable no matter what you do even if you add more or processors to a system never going to make it more ten times dave andersen a professor of computer science at carnegie university acknowledges these limitations calling reasonably well balanced and barroso who edited the paper the point is that efficiency is fantastic and wimpy cores are but if you go down to the wimpiest range your gains really have to enormous if you want to consider all the aggravation and the hit their productivity that your software engineers barroso declines to discuss specific wimpy node systems but andersen he points out that there will be cases where a server on say intel atom chips will perform quite well and prove than systems using much faster chips with the paper he wrote after joining google a decade ago he says he and a other google engineers made one of the first arguments for wimpy though they call them that all these years later he still much believes in the idea until it reaches that the word is that google is now rebuilding its infrastructure scratch so we ask barroso if google might try to push the limits and tackle that hard parallelization he speaks of i hope not he says we really like the easy cade cade

wired it data secret follow wired amazon erects new data portal between earth and the first computer password it was useless reincarnates dead paper mill as data center of by cade email finland data center is the ultimate metaphor for the age photos joe kava found himself on the southern coast of finland robotic cameras down an underground tunnel that stretched into baltic sea not quite what he expected when he joined google run its data in february of google paid about million for an paper mill in hamina finland after deciding that the building was the ideal place to build one of the massive facilities that serve up its myriad online services part of the was that the hamina mill included an underground tunnel once used pull water from the gulf of finland originally that frigid water cooled a steam generation plant at the mill but google saw it a way to cool its joe kava head of data center operations and those robotic cameras underwater vehicles typically travel down oil pipelines were used to inspect tunnel which ran through the solid granite sitting just beneath the mill as it turns out all meters of tunnel were in excellent condition and by may it was moving water to heat exchangers inside new data center helping cool down thousands of machines juggling web traffic thanks in part that granite tunnel google can run its hamina facility without electric chillers found in the average data when someone tells you selected the next data center site a paper mill built back in your first reaction might the hell are you talking says kava am i going make that a data but we were actually excited to learn the mill used sea water for cooling we wanted to make this as green a facility as possible and reusing existing infrastructure is big part of kava cites this as a prime example of how google thinks outside box when building its data centers working to create facilities are both efficient and kind to the world around them but more that hamina data center is the ideal metaphor for internet age finnish pulp and paper manufacturer stora enso shut its summa mill early in citing a drop in newsprint production that led to persistent losses in years and poor profitability prospects newspapers magazines are slowly giving way to web services along the lines well google and some of the largest services are underpinned by a breed of computer data center facilities that can handle loads while using comparatively little power and putting less of strain on the google was at the forefront of this movement building facilities not only in finland but in belgium ireland and across us the other giants of the internet soon followed including microsoft and facebook last year facebook opened a data center prineville oregon that operates without chillers cooling servers with the outside air and it has just announced that it build a second facility in sweden not far from internet the heat exchanger room in hamina data the secrets of the google data google hired joe kava in to run its data center team but this soon morphed into the operations and construction originally google leased data center space inside existing run by data center specialists but now it builds all its facilities and of late it has done so using only its own we used to hire architecture and engineering firms to do the work us kava says as grown over the years and developed our talent taken more and more of that work on over those same years google has said precious little about the of the facilities and the hardware inside them but in april search giant released a video showing the inside of its data center presumably a facility in the oregon and it has since lifted at least part of the curtain on facilities in hamina and in according to kava both of these european data centers operate chillers whereas the hamina facility pumps cold water from the the belgium data center uses an evaporative cooling system that water from a nearby industrial canal we designed and built a treatment plant kava says that way not using water from the city water for most of the year the belgium climate is mild enough to temperatures where they need to be inside the server room as points out server room temperatures be as low as traditionally are as recently as august the american society heating refrigerating and engineers recommended that data center temperatures range from and fahrenheit but google was advising operators to crank the to above the first step to building an efficient data centeris to just the temperature kava says the machines the servers the arrays everything they run just fine at much much more temperatures than the average data center runs at ludicrous to to walk into a data centers running at or fahrenheit or there are times when the temperature gets so hot inside the centers google will order employees out of the building but the servers running we have what we call normally we have to do anything but tell employees not to work in the data center during those really hot and just catch up on office at sites like belgium however there are days when too hot for the servers and google will actually move the work one of its other data centers kava did not provide details but he acknowledge that this data center shift involves a platform called spanner this platform was discussed a symposium in october but this is the first time google publicly confirmed that spanner is actually in if it really really got hot and we needed to reduce the load in data center kava says then yes we have automatic tools systems that allow for that such as according to the presentation google gave at that spanner is a storage and computation system that spans all our centers and that automatically moves and adds replicas of data computation based on constraints and usage patterns this constraints related to bandwidth packet loss power resources failure modes ie when stuff goes wrong inside the data the platform illustrates overall approach to data design the company builds its own stuff and will only say so about that stuff it views technology such as spanner as a advantage but one thing is clear google is rethinking the the approach has certainly had an effect on the rest of the like google microsoft has experimented with data center modules shipping containers prepacked with servers and other equipment can be pieced together into much larger facilities and with releasing the designs of its prineville facility a response efforts to keep its specific designs a secret others following the same lead late last year according to city engineer eric klann two unnamed companies codenamed and cloud were looking to build server farms based on chillerless design and it looks like maverick is none other iframe httpaddr large data centers small this month in an effort to show the world how kindly its data treat the outside world google announced that all of us faccilities have received iso and certification internationally recognized certifications rate the environmental kindness and safety not only of data centers all sorts of this involved tracking everything from engineering tools to inside the data center you actually learn a lot when you go these audits about things you never even considered kava says point is that google pays attention to even the smallest details data center design in all its data centers it will soon similar certification for its european facilities as in finland a punchline to baltic sea water trick kava explains the sea water is just part of the setup on the center floor the servers give off hot air this air is transferred cooling systems sitting next to the servers and then cools the water from these systems by mixing it with the sea streaming from the baltic when the process is finished the baltic water is no longer cold but before returning it to the google cools it back down with more cold sea water pulled from baltic when we discharge back to the gulf at a similar to the inlet temperature kava says that any chance of environmental according to kava the environmental permits that it temper the water i makes me feel good he says we just what we have to do we look at the right thing to do a common google message but kava argues that iso certification proof that the company is achieving its goals if close something you may believe meeting a standard but good to have a come the complaint from the likes of facebook is that the share enough about how it has solved particular problems will plague any large web outfit reports for instance indicate google builds not only its own servers but its own equipment but the company has not even acknowledged as much said over the past few years google is certainly sharing we asked joe kava about the networking hardware and he declined answer but he did acknowledge the use of spanner and he talked talked about that granite tunnel and baltic sea he even told us when google

http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html the anatomy of a hypertextual web search sergey brin and lawrence sergey computer science department stanford university stanford ca in this paper we present google a prototype of search engine which makes heavy use of the present in hypertext google is designed to crawl and index the efficiently and produce much more satisfying search results existing systems the prototype with a full text and database of at least million pages is available httpaddr to engineer a search engine is a challenging task engines index tens to hundreds of millions of web pages involving comparable number of distinct terms they answer tens of millions queries every day despite the importance of engines on the web very little academic research has been done them furthermore due to rapid advance in technology and proliferation creating a web search engine today is very from three years ago this paper provides an description our web search engine the first such detailed description we know of to apart from the problems of scaling traditional techniques to data of this magnitude there are new challenges involved with using the additional information present hypertext to produce better search results this paper this question of how to build a practical system can exploit the additional information present in hypertext also look at the problem of how to effectively deal with hypertext collections where anyone can publish anything they keywords world wide web search engines information pagerank note there are two versions of this paper a longer full and a shorter printed version the full version is available on the and the conference the web creates new challenges for information retrieval the amount information on the web is growing rapidly as well as the number of users inexperienced in the art of web research people are likely surf the web using its link graph often starting with high human maintained indices such as yahoo or with search human maintained lists cover popular topics effectively but subjective expensive to build and maintain slow to improve cannot cover all esoteric topics automated search engines that rely keyword matching usually return too many low quality matches to matters worse some advertisers attempt to gain attention taking measures meant to mislead automated search engines we built a search engine which addresses many of the of existing systems it makes especially heavy use of the structure present in hypertext to provide much higher quality results we chose our system name google because it is a spelling of googol or and fits well with our goal of very search web search engines scaling up search engine technology has had to scale dramatically to keep up the growth of the web in one of the first web search the world wide web worm httpaddr mcbryan had an index of web pages and web accessible documents as of november the search engines claim to index from million webcrawler to million web documents from search engine it is that by the year a comprehensive index of the web will over a billion documents at the same time the number of search engines handle has grown incredibly too in march and the world wide web worm received an average of about per day in november altavista claimed it handled roughly million queries per day with the increasing number of users on web and automated systems which query search engines it is that top search engines will handle hundreds of millions of queries day by the year the goal of our system is to address many of problems both in quality and scalability introduced by scaling engine technology to such extraordinary google scaling with the creating a search engine which scales even to web presents challenges fast crawling technology is needed to gather the documents and keep them up to date storage space must be efficiently to store indices and optionally the documents the indexing system must process hundreds of gigabytes of efficiently queries must be handled quickly at a rate of hundreds thousands per these tasks are becoming increasingly difficult as the web however hardware performance and cost have improved dramatically partially offset the difficulty there are however several exceptions to this progress such as disk seek time and operating robustness in designing google we have considered both the rate growth of the web and technological changes google is designed scale well to extremely large data sets it makes efficient use storage space to store the index its data structures are optimized fast and efficient access see section further we expect the cost to index and store text or html will eventually relative to the amount that will be available see appendix will result in favorable scaling properties for centralized like design improved search our main goal is to improve the quality of web search engines in some people believed that a complete search index would make possible to find anything easily according to best of the web navigators the best navigation service should make it easy find almost anything on the web once all the data is however the web of is quite different anyone who has used search engine recently can readily testify that the completeness the index is not the only factor in the quality of search junk results often wash out any results that a user is interested in fact as of november only one of the top four search engines finds itself returns its own search page in response its name in the top ten one of the main causes of problem is that the number of documents in the indices has increasing by many orders of magnitude but the ability to at documents has not people are still only willing to look at first few tens of results because of this as the collection grows we need tools that have very high precision number of documents returned say in the top tens of indeed we our notion of relevant to only include the very best documents there may be tens of thousands of slightly relevant documents very high precision is important even at the expense of recall total number of relevant documents the system is able to is quite a bit of recent optimism that the use of more information can help improve search and other marchiori spertus weiss kleinberg particular link structure page and link text provide a lot information for making relevance judgments and quality google makes use of both link structure and anchor text see and academic search engine aside from tremendous growth the web has also become commercial over time in of web servers were on httpaddr domains this number grew to over in at the same time engines have migrated from the academic domain to the commercial until now most search engine development has gone on at companies little publication of technical details this causes search technology to remain largely a black art and to be advertising see appendix with google we have a strong goal to push development and understanding into the academic another important design goal was to build systems that numbers of people can actually use usage was important to us we think some of the most interesting research will involve the vast amount of usage data that is available from modern systems for example there are many tens of millions of performed every day however it is very difficult to get this mainly because it is considered commercially our final design goal was to build an architecture that can novel research activities on web data to support research uses google stores all of the actual documents it crawls compressed form one of our main goals in designing google was to up an environment where other researchers can come in quickly large chunks of the web and produce interesting results that have been very difficult to produce otherwise in the short time system has been up there have already been several papers databases generated by google and many others are underway goal we have is to set up a environment where or even students can propose and do interesting experiments on web system the google search engine has two important features that help produce high precision results first it makes use of the structure of the web to calculate a quality ranking for each web this ranking is called pagerank and is described in detail in second google utilizes link to improve search pagerank bringing order to the the citation link graph of the web is an important resource that largely gone unused in existing web search engines we have maps containing as many as million of these hyperlinks significant sample of the total these maps allow rapid calculation a web pagerank an objective measure of its importance that corresponds well with subjective idea importance because of this correspondence pagerank is an way to prioritize the results of web keyword searches for most subjects a simple text matching search that is restricted to web titles performs admirably when pagerank prioritizes the results available at for the type of full searches in the main google system pagerank also helps a great description of pagerank academic citation literature has been applied to the web largely counting citations or backlinks to a given page this gives approximation of a importance or quality pagerank extends idea by not counting links from all pages equally and by by the number of links on a page pagerank is defined as we assume page a has pages which point to it ie the parameter d is a damping factor which can be between and we usually set d to there are more about d in the next section also is defined as the number links going out of page a the pagerank of a page a is given d d note that the pageranks form a probability distribution over pages so the sum of all web pageranks will be pagerank or can be calculated using a simple iterative and corresponds to the principal eigenvector of the normalized matrix of the web also a pagerank for million web pages can computed in a few hours on a medium size workstation there are other details which are beyond the scope of this intuitive pagerank can be thought of as a model of user behavior we assume is a random surfer who is given a web page at random and clicking on links never hitting back but eventually gets bored starts on another random page the probability that the random visits a page is its pagerank and the d damping factor is probability at each page the random surfer will get bored and another random page one important variation is to only add the factor d to a single page or a group of pages this allows personalization and can make it nearly impossible to mislead the system in order to get a higher ranking we have other extensions to pagerank again see page another intuitive justification is that a page can have a high if there are many pages that point to it or if there are some that point to it and have a high pagerank intuitively pages that well cited from many places around the web are worth looking at pages that have perhaps only one citation from something like yahoo homepage are also generally worth looking at if a page not high quality or was a broken link it is quite likely that homepage would not link to it pagerank handles both these cases everything in between by recursively propagating weights through link structure of the anchor the text of links is treated in a special way in our search most search engines associate the text of a link with the page that link is on in addition we associate it with the page the link to this has several advantages first anchors often provide accurate descriptions of web pages than the pages themselves anchors may exist for documents which cannot be indexed by a search engine such as images programs and databases this makes possible to return web pages which have not actually been crawled that pages that have not been crawled can cause problems since are never checked for validity before being returned to the user this case the search engine can even return a page that never existed but had hyperlinks pointing to it however it is possible sort the results so that this particular problem rarely this idea of propagating anchor text to the page it refers to implemented in the world wide web worm mcbryan because it helps search information and expands the coverage with fewer downloaded documents we use anchor mostly because anchor text can help provide better quality using anchor text efficiently is technically difficult because of large amounts of data which must be processed in our current crawl million pages we had over million anchors which we other aside from pagerank and the use of anchor text google has other features first it has location information for all hits and it makes extensive use of proximity in search second google track of some visual presentation details such as font size of words in a larger or bolder font are weighted higher than other third full raw html of pages is available in a related search research on the web has a short and concise history the wide web worm httpaddr mcbryan was one of the first web engines it was subsequently followed by several other academic engines many of which are now public companies compared to the of the web and the importance of search engines there are precious documents about recent search engines pinkerton according michael mauldin chief scientist lycos inc mauldin various services including lycos closely guard the details of however there has been a fair amount of work on features of search engines especially well represented is work can get results by the results of existing search engines or produce small scale individualized search finally there has been a lot of research on information systems especially on well controlled collections in the next sections we discuss some areas where this research needs to extended to work better on the information work in information retrieval systems goes back many years and is developed witten however most of the research on retrieval systems is on small well controlled homogeneous such as collections of scientific papers or news stories on a topic indeed the primary benchmark for information retrieval text retrieval conference trec uses a fairly small controlled collection for their benchmarks the very large benchmark is only gb compared to the gb from our crawl of million web pages things that work well on trec often do not good results on the web for example the standard vector space tries to return the document that most closely approximates the given that both query and document are vectors defined by their occurrence on the web this strategy often returns very documents that are the query plus a few words for example we seen a major search engine return a page containing only bill sucks and picture from a bill clinton query some argue that on web users should specify more accurately what they want and add words to their query we disagree vehemently with this position if user issues a query like bill clinton they should get results since there is a enormous amount of high quality available on this topic given examples like these we believe that standard information retrieval work needs to be extended to effectively with the differences between the web and well controlled the web is a vast collection of completely uncontrolled documents documents on the web have extreme variation internal to documents and also in the external meta information that might available for example documents differ internally in their both human and programming vocabulary email addresses links codes phone numbers product numbers type or format text pdf images sounds and may even be machine generated log files output from a on the other hand we define external information as information that can be inferred about a document is not contained within it examples of external meta include things like reputation of the source update quality popularity or usage and citations not only are the sources of external meta information varied but the things that being measured vary many orders of magnitude as well for compare the usage information from a major homepage like currently receives millions of page views every day with an historical article which might receive one view every ten clearly these two items must be treated very differently by a another big difference between the web and traditional well collections is that there is virtually no control over what people put on the web couple this flexibility to publish anything with enormous influence of search engines to route traffic and which deliberately manipulating search engines for profit become serious problem this problem that has not been addressed traditional closed information retrieval systems also it interesting to note that metadata efforts have largely failed with search engines because any text on the page which is not represented to the user is abused to manipulate search engines are even numerous companies which specialize in manipulating engines for system first we will provide a high level discussion of the then there is some descriptions of important data finally the major applications crawling indexing and searching be examined in figure high level google google architecture in this section we will give a high level overview of how the system works as pictured in figure further sections will discuss applications and data structures not mentioned in this section most google is implemented in c or for efficiency and can run in solaris or in google the web crawling downloading of web pages is done several distributed crawlers there is a urlserver that sends lists urls to be fetched to the crawlers the web pages that are fetched then sent to the storeserver the storeserver then compresses stores the web pages into a repository every web page has associated id number called a docid which is assigned whenever a url is parsed out of a web page the indexing function is performed the indexer and the sorter the indexer performs a number of it reads the repository uncompresses the documents and parses each document is converted into a set of word occurrences called the hits record the word position in document an approximation font size and capitalization the indexer distributes these hits a set of barrels creating a partially sorted forward index indexer performs another important function it parses out all links in every web page and stores important information about them an anchors file this file contains enough information to where each link points from and to and the text of the the urlresolver reads the anchors file and converts relative urls absolute urls and in turn into docids it puts the anchor text into forward index associated with the docid that the anchor points to also generates a database of links which are pairs of docids the database is used to compute pageranks for all the the sorter takes the barrels which are sorted by docid this is simplification see section and resorts them by wordid generate the inverted index this is done in place so that temporary space is needed for this operation the sorter also a list of wordids and offsets into the inverted index a program dumplexicon takes this list together with the lexicon produced by indexer and generates a new lexicon to be used by the searcher searcher is run by a web server and uses the lexicon built dumplexicon together with the inverted index and the pageranks answer major data data structures are optimized so that a large collection can be crawled indexed and searched with little although cpus and bulk input output rates have improved over the years a disk seek still requires about ms to google is designed to avoid disk seeks whenever possible and this had a considerable influence on the design of the data bigfiles are virtual files spanning multiple file systems and addressable by bit integers the allocation among multiple systems is handled automatically the bigfiles package also allocation and deallocation of file descriptors since the systems do not provide enough for our needs bigfiles also rudimentary compression figure repository data the repository contains the full html of every web page each page compressed using zlib see the choice of technique is a tradeoff between speed and compression ratio we speed over a significant improvement in compression offered bzip the compression rate of bzip was approximately to on repository as compared to to compression in the the documents are stored one after the other and are prefixed by length and url as can be seen in figure the repository requires other data structures to be used in order to access it this helps data consistency and makes development much easier we can rebuild the other data structures from only the repository and a file lists crawler document the document index keeps information about each document it is a width isam index sequential access mode index ordered by docid information stored in each entry includes the current document a pointer into the repository a document checksum and statistics if the document has been crawled it also contains pointer into a variable width file called docinfo which contains url and title otherwise the pointer points into the urllist contains just the url this design decision was driven by the desire have a reasonably compact data structure and the ability to fetch record in one disk seek during a additionally there is a file which is used to convert urls docids it is a list of url checksums with their corresponding and is sorted by checksum in order to find the docid of a url the checksum is computed and a binary search is performed the checksums file to find its docid urls may be converted into in batch by doing a merge with this file this is the technique urlresolver uses to turn urls into docids this batch mode of update crucial because otherwise we must perform one seek for every link assuming one disk would take more than a month for our million the lexicon has several different forms one important change earlier systems is that the lexicon can fit in memory for a price in the current implementation we can keep the lexicon in on a machine with mb of main memory the current lexicon million words though some rare words were not added to it is implemented in two parts a list of the concatenated together but separated by nulls and a hash table pointers for various functions the list of words has some information which is beyond the scope of this paper to explain hit a hit list corresponds to a list of occurrences of a particular word a particular document including position font and information hit lists account for most of the space used in both forward and the inverted indices because of this it is important represent them as efficiently as possible we considered alternatives for encoding position font and capitalization encoding a triple of integers a compact encoding a hand allocation of bits and huffman coding in the end we chose a optimized compact encoding since it required far less space than simple encoding and far less bit manipulation than huffman coding details of the hits are shown in figure our compact encoding uses two bytes for every hit there are two of hits fancy hits and plain hits fancy hits include hits in a url title anchor text or meta tag plain hits everything else a plain hit consists of a capitalization bit size and bits of word position in a document all positions than are labeled font size is represented relative to rest of the document using three bits only values are actually because is the flag that signals a fancy a fancy hit of a capitalization bit the font size set to to indicate it is fancy hit bits to encode the type of fancy hit and bits position for anchor hits the bits of position are split into for position in anchor and bits for a hash of the docid the occurs in this gives us some limited phrase searching as long as are not that many anchors for a particular word we expect to the way that anchor hits are stored to allow for greater resolution the position and docidhash fields we use font size relative to rest of the document because when searching you do not want to otherwise identical documents differently just because one of documents is in a larger figure forward and reverse indexes and the the length of a hit list is stored before the hits themselves to space the length of the hit list is combined with the wordid in forward index and the docid in the inverted index this limits it to and bits respectively there are some tricks which allow bits to borrowed from the if the length is longer than would fit that many bits an escape code is used in those bits and the next bytes contain the actual forward the forward index is actually already partially sorted it is stored a number of barrels we used each barrel holds a range if a document contains words that fall into a barrel the docid is recorded into the barrel followed by a list with hitlists which correspond to those words this requires slightly more storage because of duplicated docids but difference is very small for a reasonable number of buckets and considerable time and coding complexity in the final indexing done by the sorter furthermore instead of storing actual store each wordid as a relative difference from the minimum wordid falls into the barrel the wordid is in this way we can use just bits for the in the unsorted barrels leaving bits for hit list inverted the inverted index consists of the same barrels as the forward except that they have been processed by the sorter for every wordid the lexicon contains a pointer into the barrel that falls into it points to a doclist of together with corresponding hit lists this doclist represents all the occurrences that word in all an important issue is in what order the should appear in doclist one simple solution is to store them sorted by docid allows for quick merging of different doclists for multiple queries another option is to store them sorted by a ranking of occurrence of the word in each document this makes answering one queries trivial and makes it likely that the answers to multiple queries are near the start however merging is much more also this makes development much more difficult in that a change the ranking function requires a rebuild of the index we chose compromise between these options keeping two sets of inverted one set for hit lists which include title or anchor hits and set for all hit lists this way we check the first set of first and if there are not enough matches within those barrels we the larger crawling the running a web crawler is a challenging task there are performance and reliability issues and even more importantly there social issues crawling is the most fragile application since involves interacting with hundreds of thousands of web servers various name servers which are all beyond the control of the in order to scale to hundreds of millions of web pages google has fast distributed crawling system a single urlserver serves lists urls to a number of crawlers we typically ran about both urlserver and the crawlers are implemented in python each keeps roughly connections open at once this is necessary retrieve web pages at a fast enough pace at peak speeds the can crawl over web pages per second using four crawlers amounts to roughly k per second of data a major performance is dns lookup each crawler maintains a its own dns cache so it not need to do a dns lookup before crawling each document each of hundreds of connections can be in a number of different states up dns connecting to host sending request and receiving these factors make the crawler a complex component of the system uses asynchronous io to manage events and a number of queues to page fetches from state to it turns out that running a crawler which connects to more than half million servers and generates tens of millions of log generates a fair amount of email and phone calls because of the number of people coming on line there are always those who do not what a crawler is because this is the first one they have seen daily we receive an email something like wow you looked at a lot pages from my web site how did you like it there are also people who do not know about the robots exclusion protocol think their page should be protected from indexing by a statement this page is copyrighted and should not be indexed which needless say is difficult for web crawlers to understand also because of huge amount of data involved unexpected things will happen example our system tried to crawl an online game this resulted lots of garbage messages in the middle of their game it turns out was an easy problem to fix but this problem had not come up until had downloaded tens of millions of pages because of the variation in web pages and servers it is virtually impossible to a crawler without running it on large part of the internet there are hundreds of obscure problems which may only occur on one out of the whole web and cause the crawler to crash or worse unpredictable or incorrect behavior systems which access large of the internet need to be designed to be very robust and tested since large complex systems such as crawlers will cause problems there needs to be significant resources devoted reading the email and solving these problems as they come indexing the parsing any parser which is designed to run on the entire must handle a huge array of possible errors these range from in html tags to kilobytes of zeros in the middle of a characters html tags nested hundreds deep and a variety of other errors that challenge imagination to up with equally creative ones for maximum speed instead of yacc to generate a cfg parser we use flex to generate a analyzer which we outfit with its own stack developing this which runs at a reasonable speed and is very robust involved a amount of indexing documents into barrels after each document is it is encoded into a number of barrels every word is into a wordid by using an hash table the lexicon additions to the lexicon hash table are logged to a file once words are converted into their occurrences in the document are translated into hit lists and are written into forward barrels the main difficulty with parallelization of indexing phase is that the lexicon needs to be shared instead sharing the lexicon we took the approach of writing a log of the extra words that were not in a base lexicon which we fixed million words that way multiple indexers can run in and then the small log file of extra words can be processed by final sorting in order to generate the inverted index the takes each of the forward barrels and sorts it by wordid to an inverted barrel for title and anchor hits and a full inverted barrel this process happens one barrel at a time requiring little temporary storage also we parallelize sorting phase to use as many machines as we have simply by multiple sorters which can process different buckets at the time since the barrels fit into main memory the further subdivides them into baskets which do fit into memory on wordid and docid then the sorter loads each basket memory sorts it and writes its contents into the short barrel and the full inverted the goal of searching is to provide quality search results many of the large commercial search engines seemed to have made progress in terms of efficiency therefore we have focused more quality of search in our research although we believe our are scalable to commercial volumes with a bit more effort the query evaluation process is show in figure parse the convert words into seek to the start of the doclist in the short barrel for scan through the doclists until there is a document that all the search compute the rank of that document for the if we are in the short barrels and at the end of any doclist to the start of the doclist in the full barrel for every word go to step if we are not at the end of any doclist go to step sort the documents that have matched by rank and return the top figure google query to put a limit on response time once a certain number of matching documents are found the searcher goes to step in figure this means that it is possible results would be returned we are currently other ways to solve this problem in the past we sorted the according to pagerank which seemed to improve the the ranking google maintains much more information about web documents than search engines every hitlist includes position font capitalization information additionally we factor in hits from text and the pagerank of the document combining all of information into a rank is difficult we designed our ranking so that no particular factor can have too much influence consider the simplest case a single word query in order to rank document with a single word query google looks at that list for that word google considers each hit to be one of different types title anchor url plain text large font plain small font each of which has its own make up a vector indexed by type google counts the of hits of each type in the hit list then every count is into a increase linearly with counts first but quickly taper off so that more than a certain count will help we take the dot product of the vector of with vector of to compute an ir score for the finally the ir score is combined with pagerank to give a final rank the for a search the situation is more complicated multiple hit lists must be scanned through at once so that occurring close together in a document are weighted higher than occurring far apart the hits from the multiple hit lists are up so that nearby hits are matched together for every matched set hits a proximity is computed the proximity is based on how far the hits are in the document or anchor but is classified into different value bins ranging from a phrase match to not even counts are computed not only for every type of hit but for every and proximity every type and proximity pair has a the counts are converted into and we take the dot of the and the to compute an ir all of these numbers and matrices can all be displayed with the results using a special debug mode these displays have been helpful in developing the ranking the ranking function has many parameters like the and figuring out the right values for these is something of a black art in order to do this we have a feedback mechanism in the search engine a trusted user may evaluate all of the results that are returned this feedback is then when we modify the ranking function we can see the impact of change on all previous searches which were ranked although far perfect this gives us some idea of how a change in the function affects the search results and query

experience with google has shown it to better results than the major commercial search engines for searches as an example which illustrates the use of pagerank text and proximity figure shows results for a search bill these results demonstrates some of the results are clustered by server this helps considerably sifting through result sets a number of results are from whitehousegov domain which is what one may reasonably expect from a search currently most major commercial search engines do not any results from whitehousegov much less the right ones notice there is no title for the first result this is because it was crawled instead google relied on anchor text to determine this was good answer to the query similarly the fifth result is an address which of course is not crawlable it is also a result anchor all of the results are reasonably high quality pages and at check none were broken links this is largely because they all high pagerank the pageranks are the percentages in red along with graphs finally there are no results about a bill other than or about a clinton other than bill this is because we place importance on the proximity of word occurrences of course a true of the quality of a search engine would involve an extensive user or results analysis which we do not have room for here instead invite the reader to try google for themselves httpaddr storage aside from search quality google is designed to scale cost to the size of the web as it grows one aspect of this is to storage efficiently table has a breakdown of some statistics storage requirements of google due to compression the total size the repository is about gb just over one third of the total data stores at current disk prices this makes the repository a cheap source of useful data more importantly the total of all data used by the search engine requires a comparable amount of about gb furthermore most queries can be answered using just short inverted index with better encoding and compression of document index a high quality web search engine may fit onto a drive of a new storage total size of fetched pages compressed repository short inverted index full inverted index lexicon temporary anchor not in total document index variable width data links database total without repository total with repository web page number of web pages fetched number of urls seen number of email addresses number of table system it is important for a search engine to crawl and index this way information can be kept up to date and major changes to system can be tested relatively quickly for google the operations are crawling indexing and sorting it is difficult measure how long crawling took overall because disks filled up servers crashed or any number of other problems which stopped system in total it took roughly days to download the pages including however once the system was smoothly it ran much faster downloading the last million pages just hours averaging just over million pages per day or pages per second we ran the indexer and the crawler the indexer ran just faster than the crawlers this is largely we spent just enough time optimizing the indexer so that it would be a bottleneck these optimizations included bulk updates to document index and placement of critical data structures on the disk the indexer runs at roughly pages per second the sorters be run completely in parallel using four machines the whole of sorting takes about search improving the performance of search was not the major focus of research up to this point the current version of google answers queries in between and seconds this time is mostly dominated disk io over nfs since disks are spread over a number of furthermore google does not have any optimizations such as caching subindices on common terms and other common optimizations intend to speed up google considerably through distribution hardware software and algorithmic improvements our target is to able to handle several hundred queries per second table has sample query times from the current version of google they repeated to show the speedups resulting from cached initial query same query repeated io mostly query cpu total cpu total al gore vice president hard disks search engines table search google is designed to be a scalable search engine the primary goal to provide high quality search results over a rapidly growing wide web google employs a number of techniques to improve quality including page rank anchor text and proximity furthermore google is a complete architecture for gathering web indexing them and performing search queries over future a web search engine is a complex system and much remains be done our immediate goals are to improve search efficiency and scale to approximately million web pages some simple to efficiency include query caching smart disk allocation subindices another area which requires much research is updates must have smart algorithms to decide what old web pages should recrawled and what new ones should be crawled work toward this has been done in cho one promising area of research is proxy caches to build search databases since they are demand we are planning to add simple features supported by commercial engines like boolean operators negation and stemming however features are just starting to be explored such as relevance and clustering google currently supports a simple hostname we also plan to support user context like the location and result summarization we are also working to extend use of link structure and link text simple experiments pagerank can be personalized by increasing the weight of a page or bookmarks as for link text we are experimenting with text surrounding links in addition to the link text itself a search engine is a very rich environment for research ideas we far too many to list here so we do not expect this future work to become much shorter in the near high quality the biggest problem facing users of web search engines today is quality of the results they get back while the results are amusing and expand horizons they are often frustrating consume precious time for example the top result for a search bill clinton on one of the most popular commercial search engines the bill clinton joke of the day april google designed to provide higher quality search so as the web continues grow rapidly information can be found easily in order to this google makes heavy use of hypertextual information consisting link structure and link anchor text google also uses proximity font information while evaluation of a search engine is difficult have subjectively found that google returns higher quality results than current commercial search engines the analysis of structure via pagerank allows google to evaluate the quality of pages the use of link text as a description of what the link points helps the search engine return relevant and to some degree quality results finally the use of proximity information increase relevance a great deal for many scalable aside from the quality of search google is designed to scale it be efficient in both space and time and constant factors are important when dealing with the entire web in implementing google have seen bottlenecks in cpu memory access memory capacity seeks disk throughput disk capacity and network io google evolved to overcome a number of these bottlenecks during operations major data structures make efficient use available storage space furthermore the crawling indexing sorting operations are efficient enough to be able to build an index a substantial portion of the web million pages in less than week we expect to be able to build an index of million pages less than a a research in addition to being a high quality search engine google is a tool the data google has collected has already resulted in many papers submitted to conferences and many more on the way research such as abiteboul has shown a number of to queries about the web that may be answered without having the available locally this means that google or a similar system is only a valuable research tool but a necessary one for a wide range applications we hope google will be a resource for searchers researchers all around the world and will spark the next generation search engine scott hassan and alan steremberg have been critical to the of google their talented contributions are irreplaceable and authors owe them much gratitude we would also like to thank rajeev motwani jeff ullman and terry winograd and whole webbase group for

a in computer engineering at the university of michigan ann arbor he is currently a phd candidate in computer science at university some of his research interests include the link of the web human computer interaction search engines scalability information access interfaces and personal data appendix a advertising and mixed currently the predominant business model for commercial search is advertising the goals of the advertising business model do always correspond to providing quality search to users for example our prototype search engine one of the top results for cellular is the effect of cellular phone use upon driver attention study which explains in great detail the distractions and associated with conversing on a cell phone while driving this result came up first because of its high importance as judged by pagerank algorithm an approximation of citation importance on the page it is clear that a search engine which was taking for showing cellular phone ads would have difficulty justifying page that our system returned to its paying advertisers for this of reason and historical experience with other media we expect that advertising funded search engines will inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs the since it is very difficult even for experts to evaluate search search engine bias is particularly insidious a good example opentext which was reported to be selling companies the right to listed at the top of the search results for particular marchiori this type of bias is much more insidious advertising because it is not clear who deserves to be there who is willing to pay money to be listed this business model in an uproar and opentext has ceased to be a viable search engine less blatant bias are likely to be tolerated by the market example a search engine could add a small factor to search from friendly companies and subtract a factor from results competitors this type of bias is very difficult to detect but still have a significant effect on the market furthermore income often provides an incentive to provide poor quality results for example we noticed a major search engine would not a large homepage when the name was given as query it so happened that the airline had placed an expensive linked to the query that was its name a better search engine would have required this ad and possibly resulted in the loss of the from the airline to the search engine in general it could be from the consumer point of view that the better the search engine the fewer advertisements will be needed for the consumer to find they want this of course erodes the advertising supported model of the existing search engines however there will always money from advertisers who want a customer to switch products or something that is genuinely new but we believe the issue advertising causes enough mixed incentives that it is crucial to have competitive search engine that is transparent and in the appendix b scalability of we have designed google to be scalable in the near term to a goal million web pages we have just received disk and machines handle roughly that amount all of the time consuming parts of system are parallelize and roughly linear time these include like the crawlers indexers and sorters we also think that most the data structures will deal gracefully with the expansion at million web pages we will be very close up against all sorts operating system limits in the common operating systems currently run on both solaris and these include things like memory number of open file descriptors network sockets and and many others we believe expanding to a lot more than pages would greatly increase the complexity of our scalability of centralized indexing as the capabilities of computers increase it becomes possible to a very large amount of text for a reasonable cost of course more bandwidth intensive media such as video is likely to become pervasive but because the cost of production of text is low to media like video text is likely to remain very pervasive also is likely that soon we will have speech recognition that does reasonable job converting speech into text expanding the amount text available all of this provides amazing possibilities centralized indexing here is an illustrative example we assume want to index everything everyone in the us has written for a year assume that there are million people in the us and they write average of k per day that works out to be about terabytes assume that indexing a terabyte can be done now for a reasonable we also assume that the indexing methods used over the text are or nearly linear in their complexity given all these assumptions can compute how long it would take before we could index our terabytes for a reasonable cost assuming certain growth law was defined in as a doubling every months processor power it has held remarkably true not just for but for other important system parameters such as disk as well if assume that law holds for the future we need only doublings or years to reach our goal of indexing everyone in the us has written for a year for a price that a company could afford of course hardware experts are concerned law may not continue to hold for the next but there are certainly a lot of interesting centralized even if we only get part of the way to our hypothetical of course a distributed systems like gloss gravano harvest will often be the most efficient and elegant solution for indexing but it seems difficult to convince the world use these systems because of the high administration costs of up large numbers of installations of course it is quite likely reducing the administration cost drastically is possible if happens and everyone starts running a distributed indexing searching would certainly improve because humans can only type or speak a finite amount and as continue improving text indexing will scale even better than it now of course there could be an infinite amount of machine content but just indexing huge amounts of human generated seems tremendously useful so we are optimistic that our web search engine architecture will improve in

https://developers.google.com/finance/docs/2.0/developers_guide_protocol finance apis and tools google finance portfolio data guide o o o reference guide release notes previous o version guide reference guide finance finance google data client migration guide terms of guide the google finance portfolio api allows client applications to view update finance content in the form of google data protocol your client application can use the finance data api to create portfolio and transaction entries request a list of entries and or delete existing in addition to providing some background on the capabilities of finance data api this document provides examples of basic finance api interactions using httpaddr and atom xml after reading this you may want to learn more about interacting with the api using client libraries by reading the sections of this getting creating a finance finance and the real about the finance feed authenticating to the finance authsub proxy clientlogin specifying a managing creating retrieving all of a retrieving specific retrieving portfolios with additional retrieving a portfolio updating deleting managing retrieving retrieving specific managing creating retrieving all transactions for a retrieving specific updating deleting this document is intended for programmers who want to write applications that can interact with google finance using httpaddr and xml this document assumes that you understand the general ideas behind google data protocol and that familiar with the finance if using a unix system and you want to try the examples in document without writing any code you may find the unix utilities curl or wget useful for more information see the pages for those utilities or the document on using curl to with services that use the google data for finance data api reference information see the google data api reference a finance you may want to sign up for a finance account for testing finance uses google accounts so if you already have a account all and the real user accounts at google finance are not connected to brokerages other financial systems if a finance account shows the user holding a particular position that necessarily mean the actually holds that position in the real transactions that a client sends to google finance also have effect on the real world if your client sends a buy order for shares of goog that cause the user to actually anything the only thing that changes is the information in their google finance conversely if the user performs a transaction through brokerage or other system then their finance account updated until they use a client or the gui to send the about the transaction to google however the market values returns and gains provided in finance api feeds do use market data so if a user records their transactions then the performance data provided google finance is the finance feed the finance data api provides a hierarchical set of three feed portfolio lists all of the position lists all of the positions in a particular transaction lists all of the transactions that have been recorded for particular for more information about these feeds see the appropriate sections this guide or the feed types section of the to the finance a client must authenticate before using the finance data api it authenticate using either of two approaches authsub authentication or clientlogin for more information about authentication with the google data in general see the authentication most of the samples in subsequent sections of this document supplying the appropriate proxy authsub proxy authentication is used by web applications that need authenticate their users to google accounts the web site operator the client code have access to the username and password for finance user instead the client obtains special authsub tokens allow the client to act on a particular behalf for detailed information see the authsub when a user first visits your application they have not yet authenticated in this case you need to display some information and link directing the user to a google page to authenticate your for access to their the following query parameters are included in the authsubrequest the url of the page that google should redirect the user after indicates that the application is requesting a token to finance feeds the scope string to use httpaddr indicates whether the client is requesting a secure indicates whether the token returned can be exchanged for session the authsubrequest url might look like httpaddr the user follows the link to site and authenticates to google after the user authenticates the authsub system redirects them to url you specified in the next query parameter of the url the authsub system appends an authentication token to that url the value of the token query parameter for httpaddr this token value represents a authsub token in example since was specified this token can be exchanged an authsub session token by calling the authsubsessiontoken with the token in an authorization header as httpaddr httpaddr authsub httpaddr the authsubsessiontoken service response includes a token header contains the session token and an expiration header that indicates long the token will remain your application can then use the session token value in authorization header of subsequent interactions with an example of an httpaddr request containing a that you might send to httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr authsub httpaddr use clientlogin authentication if your client is a installed client such as a desktop request an authentication token using the clientlogin mechanism send post request to the following httpaddr the post body should contain a set of query parameters that look parameters passed by an html form using httpaddr content type these parameters the email the the finance service name is finance for other service see the service name identifies your client application should take the for more information about the parameters see the for installed applications if the authentication request fails then the server returns an httpaddr forbidden status if it succeeds then the server returns an httpaddr ok status plus three long alphanumeric codes in the body of the response lsid and auth the auth value is the authorization token that send to finance with each of your subsequent requests so keep a of that value you can ignore the sid and lsid since all requests to private feeds require authentication you have set the authorization header in all subsequent interactions finance using the following googlelogin where yourauthtoken is the auth string returned by the for more information about clientlogin authentication including requests and responses see the authentication for applications note use the same token for all requests in a given session acquire a new token for each finance a every request that you send using the data api should specify version of the to specify a version number use the httpaddr alternatively if you set httpaddr headers you can specify as query parameter in the url but the httpaddr header is preferred note the client libraries supply appropriate version automatically so use the query parameter when using client a portfolio is a collection of positions that the user holds in securities plus a portfolio feed lists all of the portfolios each entry contains the title along with data such as and total market value each portfolio entry also contains a link the position first create an xml representation of the entry to publish this needs to be in the form of an atom entry element which might like httpaddr httpaddr new when creating a portfolio entry specify only the title and the currency code to add a position to a portfolio transactions for that to publish this entry send it to the portfolio post url follows first place your atom entry element in the body of a post request using the content type then the new portfolio to the following httpaddr the default in the url tells google finance to use the account of currently authenticated finance creates a portfolio using the entry you sent then returns httpaddr created status code along with a copy of the new portfolio the form of an entry element the entry returned is the same one sent but it also contains various elements added by the server as an id if your request fails for some reason finance may return a status code for information about the status codes see the data protocol reference all of a to retrieve the portfolios send an authenticated httpaddr request to the portfolio feed url google finance then returns feed containing all of the portfolio entries for example get a list of portfolios for the currently authenticated user send

feed include performance for example to request a finance portfolio feed with performance and financial returns included send an httpaddr request to the feed url with the parameter httpaddr google finance returns an httpaddr ok status code and a feed all of the portfolio entries as before except that each includes data about that returns and the updated for each entry and for the feed itself is

that retrieved before can improve efficiency by telling google finance to send the only if it has changed since the last time you retrieved to do this sort of conditional retrieval send an httpaddr get request includes an httpaddr header in the header specify etag which you can find in the entry for when google finance receives this request it checks to see whether photo that you requested has the same etag as the etag you if the etags match then the entry changed and google returns an httpaddr not modified status if the etags match then the portfolio has been modified the last time you requested it and google finance returns for more information about etags see the google data reference to update an existing entry first you retrieve the entry you want update then you modify it and

http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/papers/1361.pdf is tom cruise threatened using netflix prize data to examine the long tail of electronic f and information management wharton business school university of pennsylvania philadelphia pennsylvania analyze a large data set from netflix the leading online movie rental company to shed new light on the causes and consequences of the long tail effect which suggests that on the internet over time consumers will increasingly shift away from hit products and toward niche products we examine the aggregate level demand as well as demand at the individual consumer level and we find that the consumption of both the hit and the niche movies decreased over time when the popularity of the movies is ranked in absolute terms eg the however we also observe that the active product variety has increased dramatically over the study separate out the demand diversification effect from the shift in consumer preferences we propose to measure the popularity of movies in relative terms by dynamically adjusting for the current product variety eg the of using this alternative definition of popularity we find that the demand for the hits rises while the demand for the niches still falls we conclude that new movie titles appear much faster than consumers discover them finally we find no evidence that niche titles satisfy consumer tastes better than hit titles and that a small number of heavy users are more likely to venture into niches than light the long tail effect movie rental product variety product rating purchase frequency internet anderson of wired magazine coined the term tail anderson suggesting that due to the introduction of the internet niche products will comprise higher and higher market share while the demand for hit products will continue to decrease as a result he predicted that the old pareto rule stating that of all the products generate of the revenues will no longer hold hit movies will constitute a smaller and smaller proportion of predictions of the long tail effect were motivated by observations in the media entertainment and other industries for example anderson finds that the top albums of all time were produced in the s and s none of them were recorded in recent years he also observes that the ratings of the top tv shows have gradually decreased and that the top show today would not have ranked among the top ten in part of the reason according to anderson is that niche products will better and better satisfy consumer preferences because consumers will continue to have more and more varying preferences while the internet will make even the most obscure products available to the potential for the existence of the long tail effect is of great importance for product assortment decisions in a variety of industries for advertising dollars spent on supporting this variety and for supply chain management of these products on the internet for example blockbuster stocks dvds per store on average while of netflix rental revenues come from outside the top titles anderson in addition ecast a digital jukebox company sold of its albums available online at least one track per album per quarter anderson while music stores only stock a fraction of this variety if demand is indeed shifting toward more obscure titles managers should ensure that these titles are available and that they are advertised properly further anderson explains that the new online recommendation systems help the niche products quickly find their demand in the market once they are made a result he asserts that tail of available variety is far longer than we and that the combined market share of the niches can outgrow the hits anderson this comment about the increasing demand for the niches seems to be consistent with opinion in light of the cheaper technology in the media industry specifically varian notes that this inexpensive and compelling semiprofessional content available via the has an increased particularly among young people so that the salaries of celebrities such as tom cruise may arguments and evidence in favor of the long tail effect appeared pervasive at first there are also indications that hits still drive some markets and may even become more popular over time whereas the rising demand for niches is at best overestimated in particular some evidence suggests that new products appear so quickly that consumers have no time to discover them gomes discloses that at ecast the quarterly rate increased from to product variety has grown ignoring this increasing number of products with no demand is known to cause a biased estimation of the sales distribution schmittlein et al in addition an even stronger demand for hits is found in the motion picture industry where both the number of movies that generate revenues of over million and their percentage of the total revenues increased from and in to and in respectively eliashberg et al finally orlowski reports on an industry study which discovered that of the digital song inventory sold no copies at all and the of the frequency distribution was far more concentrated than expected given this conflicting evidence whether or not the long tail effect exists remains a hotly debated issue among long tail effect has also recently generated widespread interest in academic circles more on these and related papers brynjolfsson et al present plausible factors that may drive the long tail effect including both and the effects on the supply side they suggest that the internet reduces the production and distribution costs of niche products on the demand side they note that both the active and the passive search tools of the internet lower the search costs and hence facilitate finding niche products moreover tucker and zhang suggest that product popularity information such as the number of people who have browsed the product can increase the appeal of niche products disproportionately thus causing the long tail effect on the other hand fleder and hosanagar suggest that sales diversity can be reduced by recommendation systems because these systems tend to recommend products with sufficient historical data ie hits while park and tuzhilin propose an algorithm that can promote recommendations for the tail items bockstedt and goh analyze the data of custom cds to examine whether people tend to bundle the hits or the long music and suggest that managers should sell unbundled information goods to meet the demand the mainstream consumer elberse and find further evidence that online retailing triggers demand to shift toward the tail of the distribution although they also find that a substantive part of demand is concentrated on an even smaller portion of far both academic theories and the empirical evidence provide what can probably be described as conflicting evidence for the existence and the magnitude of the long tail effect while there are many anecdotal examples of its presence there are fewer than a handful of rigorous studies at the same time whether or not the long tail exists is a fundamental question for in marketing operations and finance who face the prospect of further penetration of the internet channel which offers expanding product variety and new recommendation systems to help manage this paper we provide empirical evidence to shed additional light on the existence of the long tail effect from a different perspective we use a novel longitudinal data from netflix that contains million online ratings of movie titles by users from to netflix is the key example in evidence for the long tail effect and he primarily refers to the popularity of products in absolute terms eg the top or the top for hits and the bottom the bottom for niches in his own words one is still number one but the sales that go with that are not what they once anderson following this example we first study the number of ratings for movie titles over time and find that when movie popularity is measured in absolute terms there is only partial evidence to support the long tail effect demand for hits decreases over time but demand for niches decreases above definition of the long tail effect and movie popularity is static which implicitly excludes the impact of an increasing product variety this definition would certainly reflect product popularity in a channel where product variety is relatively stable and where all products are consumed such as in a store however product variety has skyrocketed during the internet age and more products than ever are not being discovered by consumers for example in our data the number of rated movies increased by a factor of four over five years while the number of unrated movies exceeds the number of rated movies by a factor of two in such a dramatic increase in product variety is likely to create demand diversification for example given a choice set of only five movies people may tend to concentrate their demand on one movie whose popularity rank is number or equivalently in the top however out of a wider choice set movies the demand may be concentrated on movies whose popularity ranks in the top or also in the top this example causes a conflicting definition of hits and niches amid different sizes of product variety at different points in time should we classify the top which is respectively the top one out of five movies and the top out of movies as the hits or should we restrict the label of hits to only the top one movie no matter the total when the product variety is large the demand for any one product tends to be smaller than when the product variety is small likewise when the consumer base is large learning about new products is faster than when the consumer base is small in this case two competing effects might be observed consumers discover the obscure products as they appear and new products appear possibly so quickly that most consumers have no time to discover them which effect dominates is an empirical question that we aim to address in this paper therefore we argue the definitions of hits and niches should vary with time as both product variety and consumer base vary in this paper we propose a dynamic definition of product popularity which adjusts for active product variety over time which excludes titles that have no current the active product variety reflects the dynamics of both product variety and consumer base we find that if we define the popularity of a movie in relative terms the long tail effect is absent in fact the demand for hits increases whereas the demand for niches decreases specifically we find that demand for the top of movies increases five times as fast as demand for the top indicating that demand for the of the continues to skyrocket the same finding is manifested by changes in the pareto principle over time while anderson argues that the rule will weaken the top of products will constitute less than of demand we find that the opposite is true the share of demand for the top of movies increases over time from in to in anderson has argued that more and more consumers will choose niche products because they will tend to satisfy consumer preferences better we however find that contrary to suggestion and independent of how popularity is measured consumers tend to be less satisfied with niche movies than with hit movies and moreover it is mostly heavy movie watchers who constitute a small fraction of all consumers that venture into niche summarize the contributions of this paper are first we provide new empirical results suggesting that there is only partial evidence for the existence of the long tail effect when it is measured in an absolute sense second we propose to delineate two effects demand due to expanding product variety on the internet and consumers learning about new suggest that when measuring product popularity one has to adjust for instantaneous active product variety with this definition we find no evidence of the long tail effect third we study demand at the consumer level and find that new movies appear so quickly that most consumers have no time to discover them and that niche movies do not satisfy consumer tastes better than hit remainder of this paper is organized as follows we review the related literature in section and develop our hypotheses in section in section we describe our data set and methods of research we present the results of our empirical analysis in section we conclude with a discussion of our results limitations and future research opportunities in section theories argue that the presence of popular items ie hits is quite persistent in the market rosen suggests that buyers tend to concentrate their demand on the because of their imperfect substitutability and the joint consumption effects the imperfect substitution causes small differences in the of the sellers to be in larger earnings the joint consumption effect further ensures that demand concentrates on the few most talented sellers frank and cook add that consumers tend to demand similar products such as movies or music in order to have a common language in their social the traditional theories have compelling arguments to support the market they are restricted to the era when the shelf space in stores was limited explanation about the long tail effect echoes brynjolfsson et theory regarding the value of increased product variety on the internet this important and timely paper not only finds evidence of a significantly larger product variety at online retailers such as amazon than at stores but it also suggests that the internet significantly lowers search costs so consumers can find more products consistent with this view cachon et al find that the lowered search costs have a effect which encourages firms to enlarge their assortment as a result consumers are more likely to find niche products thus causing demand for them to it is widely accepted that search costs are lowered as information technology proliferates this does not necessarily reduce demand concentration for example ghose and gu suggest that search costs are even lower for popular products than for niches which may limit the long tail effect in addition provides a model to argue that different search processes have mixed impacts on demand et al use a unique data set from a retailer operating both internet and catalog channels and provide evidence of the long tail paper is one of the studies to directly compare demand concentration in both internet and cataloger channels brynjolfsson et al assume that the number of available products is the same in both channels they further randomly select items from the cataloger channel selling items in total and another items from the internet channel selling items in total about of the total sales of the cataloger the comparison of these sales data suggests that the internet channel exhibits less concentrated sales which is in line with the long tail theory smith et al argue that the long tail titles ie the niches not only increase consumer surplus but also enhance producer surplus our study differs in that we do not possess data on sales in the internet and channels rather we study what happens in the internet channel over another study exploring the long tail effect elberse and study the nielsen videoscan data by tracking weekly video sales from to in this study the authors rank all the movies across the six years according to their weekly sales and define the top percentiles as the hits and the lower percentiles as the niches in other words they create static definitions of hits and niches for all the movies over a span of six years which implicitly excludes the impact of an increasing product variety we use different definitions of hits and niches that vary with time elberse further reports analysis of the data from nielsen soundscan which tracks weekly sales of music from quickflix an australian movie rental service similar to netflix and from rhapsody an online music jukebox the different data supports the same conclusion that the and we study ratings submitted by consumers as part of our analysis there are at least two other relevant studies and sundararajan use data from distinct categories on httpaddr to establish that categories whose products are influenced more by have significantly flatter demand distribution which supports the existence of the long tail effect dellarocas and narayan find empirically that online consumers are more likely to review popular products and therefore contrary to the long tail effect online reviews may exhibit instead of summary the extant literature has found conflicting evidence of the long tail effect the main differentiating features of our analysis are dynamic definitions of product popularity and detailed analysis both of which are possible because we study a unique and extensive data set which includes product ratings by consumers over the course of six and ranking before the internet increased product variety was known to better satisfy heterogeneous needs thus increasing overall demand for the firm selling these products baumol and ide kekre and srinivasan consumers are found to have a propensity for seeking variety over time farquhar and rao and pessemier suggest that people seek a variety of products to dynamically balance and maximize the utilities obtained from the attributes of the different products in addition mcalister proposes that people consume new products because they are satiated with the attributes of the old variety expands dramatically on the internet which allows for offering many more products economically internet retailers such as httpaddr are able to utilize novel fulfillment strategies such as to sell products to customers without actually stocking them thus dramatically increasing product variety without significant extra costs randall et al their pivotal paper brynjolfsson et al show that the wider product variety offered by httpaddr has increased the consumer surplus seven to ten times more relative to gains from competition and lower pricing alone further most online companies now provide recommendation systems to lower search costs so that consumers are able to discover even the most obscure products in the internet era brynjolfsson et al and if product variety expands and consumers are increasingly able to gain access to new products it should also be the case that demand for most popular products decreases while demand for less popular titles increases as varian explains is true that there is only one tom cruise but it is equally true that there are only hours in a day the more time young people spend watching lonelygirl the less time they will have to watch mr these considerations lead us to hypothesize similar to anderson that the long tail effect should be present if we focus on hits and niches defined in absolute a if popularity is measured in absolute terms over time demand for hits will decrease while demand for niches will a if popularity is measured in absolute terms over time individual consumers will demand fewer hit products and more niche there is little doubt that the internet allows companies to offer a wider variety of products economically it is less clear that consumers necessarily quickly discover these products niche products tend not to have associated advertising budgets and there is typically no sales representative on the internet helping the customer find the product both anderson and brynjolfsson et al suggest that the role of the sales person on the internet is played by the electronic customer relationship management systems which are increasingly utilized by internet companies padmanabhan and tuzhilin these systems usually utilize techniques to help consumers discover products however fleder and hosanagar find that although recommendation systems can guide users to new products they often tend to lead users toward the same thus causing the aggregate diversity of products consumed to decrease over time indeed most product recommendation systems are based on collaborative filtering techniques which would not recommend a product with no historical demand thus such systems would most often recommend hits rather than niches further research has shown that consumers only consider a few important choices when they shop online for instance gu et al find that at some online retailers consumers who consider only two or fewer alternatives are responsible for over half of all purchases which implies that consumers might simply not have time to venture into obscure view of the limitations imposed by current recommendation systems we can expect to see two competing effects first the internet channel allows retailers to economically offer larger and larger product variety over time second driven by varying consumer preferences and with the help of recommendation systems consumers discover and consume products heretofore unavailable the question is which effect dominates to be able to delineate the two effects it is necessary to definitions of hits and niches that vary with time and that account for product variety we therefore propose a dynamic definition of product popularity that adjusts for increased product variety over time such as the top and the bottom of total products demanded to normalize the impact of product variety this definition is not new in fact it is in the spirit of the pareto principle which suggests that of products account for of the current limitations of recommendation systems and the relative infancy of electronic customer relationship management systems we hypothesize that product variety increases faster than the speed at which people discover products so in relative terms the long term effect is b if popularity is measured in relative terms over time the demand for hits will increase while the demand for niches will b if popularity is measured in relative terms over time individual consumers will demand more hit products and fewer niche setting data collection and descriptive statistics to examine our research hypotheses we utilize data available from netflix a major us online series rental service with annual revenues in excess of billion in netflix is known for offering a wide selection of niche movies and it currently offers about dvd titles to its million subscribers the data that we possess consist of the movie ratings submitted by consumers through the netflix web site from to netflix encourages its users to rate the movies that they have watched both outside and within netflix to improve its recommendations for them so users have direct incentives to provide truthful and complete ratings in addition netflix constantly reminds users to rate the movies and it streamlines the rating process as a result shih et al suggest that netflix has the largest collection of movie ratings netflix made these data available to the public during the netflix prize competition which offered million to the team that could use this data to create the most accurate movie recommendation system the data set contains approximately user ids series and over million in the rest of the paper we refer to both the movies and the tv series at netflix as movies for which are about a random sample of all ratings submitted by believe that our data provide rich evidence to study the long tail effect for several as anderson argues netflix operates in the environment that is most conducive to observing the long tail effect because netflix is an internet company which capitalizes on the favorable economics of dvd distribution to offer much larger product variety to consumers than its closest competitors such as blockbuster second netflix is known to utilize one of the most advanced movie recommendation systems and therefore netflix users are very likely to be able to discover niche titles fast moreover communication plays a very important role in the movie industry de vany and walls so unlike in the case of narrowly focused internet retailers we expect consumers to also be able to discover new products through the effect third internet penetration increased dramatically in the time period and therefore by studying netflix data over time we can observe temporal changes in movie consumption and study the long tail effect the data that netflix offers allows doing so both at the movie and at the individual consumer level which is quite rare finally the netflix prize data set is the largest among all the related presents descriptive statistics of the ratings by year as well as the product variety collected from the annual the average movie rating measured on a scale of one to five has improved from in to in although there was a slight dip in addition the number of rated movies almost exactly quadrupled from to indicating that the consumers at netflix watched an increasingly wider range of movies despite this demand diversification the number of unrated movies increased more than five times from to with the number of different movies the total number of ratings and the rater base expanded even faster both of them increased about times from to the substantial increase in demand is likely to be attributed to the quick adoption of dvd players among consumers as well as to successful transition to a prepaid subscription service from a pricing model shih et al company reports are available from when netflix went descriptive netflix prize data and company shows that the number of monthly ratings increased exponentially from january to october and that the number of rated movies increased quadratically during the same comparison of the two functions suggests that the number of ratings has grown considerably faster than product variety has which further indicates that the demand for niche movies should emerge very quickly these observations seem to offer favorable conditions for us to expect an increasing demand for niches a relevant question to ask is whether the active product variety is growing because a lot of new movies are being released or because consumers keep discovering previously released titles our data indicates that slightly over new movies are released every year on average while about of movies are newly rated every year in addition between and of netflix rentals are reported to originate from the back catalog movies rather than new releases flynn these observations suggest that the product variety growth is primarily due to discovery of older movies by consumers the more precise answer to this question is complicated by the fact that many movies are released on dvds later than in theaters but this gap continues to decrease over time further most movies are released in several dvd versions at different points in time which makes it hard to exactly delineate ratings of vs data were incomplete in november and december so we excluded them from our monthly numbers of rated movies and ratings monthly number of number of distinct rated much of our analysis we elect to work with monthly instead of daily or yearly data and therefore we aggregate all variables at the monthly level by so doing we ensure both an sample size in each month for each movie and enough observations over time for statistically significant estimates this approach also makes sense given that netflix charges its consumers monthly for services and therefore we expect consumer behavior to be tied to a monthly shown in the descriptive statistics the number of ratings the number of rated movies and the average ratings contain time trends that may cause a false conclusion of the relationship of the three variables to mitigate this problem we add a time trend of the months from january october to our data table reports the correlations for each correlation table of monthly netflix ratings of left illustrates the distribution of the number of ratings after pooling all the observations from to as can be seen demand is approximately logarithmically distributed the top of movies constitute close to of the total number of ratings the top of movies contribute to almost the top of movies generate approximately implying that demand is highly likely to be concentrated on a few titles ie the is important to stipulate here that the ratings data that we possess only reflect the number of movies rated but not all customers rate all movies that they watch on the other hand customers do not have to watch the movie to be able to rate it so ratings data might actually present a fuller picture of consumer demand for movies than rental data would furthermore previous literature see chen et al suggested a strong connection between product demand and the number of consumer reviews one potential problem with utilizing movie ratings as a proxy for demand is that online review data is known to be biased because users tend to review items that they extremely like or dislike thus causing the histogram to be or see hu et al dellarocas and narayan dellarocas and wood and citations therein to check for the possibility of this bias in our data we plot the histogram of the rating values on a scale from one to five in figure we observe that the users gave the rating of four most frequently ratings followed by the ratings of three five two and one the histogram is dramatically different from the data reported by other papers eg dellarocas and wood that of ebay transactions result in positive reviews and it seems to suggest that netflix users are not biased toward giving only extremely high or extremely low ratings we believe that while previous studies focused on the propensity to review products on httpaddr and httpaddr our data are fundamentally different for two reasons first we have pure ratings data rather than review data and giving a rating is much less costly to a user than writing a review second the recommendation system of netflix directly incentivizes users to reveal their truthful and complete preference for movies to improve their recommendations we therefore proceed with utilizing ratings as a proxy for demand although it should be understood that we imply the number of number of ratings distribution and histogram of rating values o demonstrates the summary statistics at the consumer level the number of movies rated per person every month is highly skewed toward the high percentiles indicating that a small group of people rate a massive number of movies each month it is possible that the large number of movies rated such as for th percentile and for th percentile contain a large number of ratings given by users to train the recommendation system because a user can only watch a limited number of movies every month ratings submitted during the training process can result in a of the data because the ratings of previously watched movies may not reflect the current popularity of a movie in order to alleviate this issue and provide a robustness check we purged the data with the monthly number of rated movies more than we choose the cutoff point of because watching movies a month is probably the maximum number of movies that a heavy user is technically allowed to watch within netflix rental system our results remain qualitatively and quantitatively similar so in the paper we report results without dropping any it does not appear that heavy users have a tendency to give higher or lower ratings because the frequency of ratings very weakly correlates with the average rating correlation and with the variance of ratings correlation figure further shows that consumer ratings are almost normally distributed except that the right tail is censored at the rating of because of the limit of the rating scale this nearly normal distribution of consumer ratings provides further evidence that the users at netflix may not be biased toward rating the movies that they extremely like or extremely dislike furthermore the variance of ratings is skewed which suggests that the majority of the people tend to be consistent in their monthly consumer breakdown of movies of netflix prize monthly rating the netflix prize data provide millions of movie ratings they contain no movie characteristics such as genre ratings and mpaa ratings the movie characteristics have shown a direct association with movie demand in some studies eliashberg et al and the lack of this information may cause an omitted variable bias in order to cope with this potential problem we designed a web crawler to query the yahoo movies website a database of movie information and to automatically retrieve movie characteristic information on about movies we then joined the movie characteristics to the netflix rating data to control for movie exhibits the descriptive statistics of the combined data from netflix and yahoo that one movie may be tagged with multiple genres similar to the original netflix prize data the total number of ratings and the total number of rated movies rapidly increased from to admittedly the yahoo data is not nearly as comprehensive as the netflix prize data since critics tend to cover only hit movies which limits the product variety on yahoo table presents the correlations for each month at the monthly level which are all quite descriptive statistics of the yahoo movies netflix prize data and yahoo correlation table of the monthly yahoo movies rating of critics and are interested in studying demand for hit vs niche movies and therefore we define the variable popularity jt to reflect how popular movie j is at time t in particular we rank the number of ratings that each movie receives within each month in a descending order and we use this rank to reflect the popularity note that a higher lower rank indicates a less more popular movie to be able to test our hypotheses we use two definitions of popularity jt one is in absolute terms and the other is in relative terms the absolute rankings eg the top the top were used in the previous literature including anderson alternatively we propose to rank movies in relative terms eg the top the top thus adjusting for current product variety the total number of movies rated this define product varietyt as the total number of different movies that were rated during the time period t note that this variable reflects the active product variety as there are many movies which are not rated in a given month we believe that the active product variety is a more relevant variable than the total variety because products that are not discovered by consumers or that are discovered but forgotten should not be taken into account when ranking popularity and it accounts for both the product offering and consumer demand clearly by using active rather than total product variety we are more likely to find evidence of the long tail we define the demand for individual movies with a proxy reflects the share of the number of ratings among all the rated movies during a given time period similar to other data such as sales ranks page views click streams and online music samplings shares of ratings have been used in previous research as proxies for demand dewan and ramaprasad chevalier and goolsbee tucker and zhang using popularity jt product varietyt and demandjt we can analyze the distribution of the cumulative demand every year both in absolute terms and in relative terms and we can also compute the yearly gini systems with average ratings have proliferated on the internet and have had a growing impact on decision making dellarocas in this paper unlike in other studies we are able to control for product rating using the avg ratingjt variable which reflects the average rating that the movie received in a given month this control is important because long tail effect might be simply a manifestation of the fact that hit movies have deteriorated in quality over time which maybe an important driver of the long tail effect movie ratings in our data are probably reflective of the tastes and acceptance of the movies and it is known that ratings can influence the choices of future consumers eliashberg et al all variable definitions at the movie level are presented in table analysis variable definitions statistics ranked by the number of ratings of a particular movie j during time period t either in absolute or relative of the number of the ratings among all the rated movies during time period t number of rated movies during time period t rating of the movies whose popularity ranks are below cutoff of different mpaa ratings within the movies whose popularity ranks are below cutoff k eg rs rating of the movies whose popularity ranks are below cutoff k of different genres within the movies whose popularity ranks are below cutoff k eg dramas a sequence representing the time addition to the variables we further define variables for our define nicheseekingit as the average ranking of the movies that the consumer rates in a given month in essence nicheseekingit is a summary statistic of the variable popularity it a high value of nicheseekingit means that this particular consumer tends to watch more niche movies likewise brynjolfsson et al use the average sales rank of all the products that a consumer purchases however we believe that focusing on averages may be too restrictive if the distribution is skewed for example a consumer with a skewed set of purchases ranked st nd rd and th has an average sales rank of another consumer with a set of purchases ranked th th th and th has an average sales rank of the average sales rank of the second consumer is smaller than that of the first consumer it is hard to argue that the second consumer is more inclined to watch hits than the first in addition to the mean measurement we calculate the median the top and the bottom of the popularity jt values to obtain more complete information about consumer we divide these metrics by monthly product variety to obtain relative relative measurements adjust for both the increasing product variety and the skewness of demand order to control for consumer heterogeneity over time we define frequency it as the number of movies that user i rated in month t in marketing certain theoretical constructs such as the dirichlet model suggest a strong link between purchase frequency and brand choice in particular it is often found that most consumers of a brand are buyers chatfield and goodhardt goodhardt et al these light buyers often constitute the majority of the customers who purchase the popular brand mcphee because of the effect rosen in addition mcphee explains that consumers who are familiar with the alternatives tend to consume the niche products therefore consumers with frequency are likely to consume more niche products than those with frequency because the former may be better informed of the variety of products than the we define rating propensity it and rating variance it as the average and the variance of the ratings that user i gives in month t these two measurements are likely to reflect tastes and movie acceptance for example clemons et al demonstrate the relationship between variance of ratings and demand for products further hu et al recommend controlling for the standard deviation of ratings as well as for two modes to overcome consumer bias since in our case the distribution of ratings is symmetric we do not control for the modes all variables are defined in table table presents the correlations of consumer characteristics that we possess we do not report any strong analysis variable definitions of the movies that user i rated in month t measured as the mean the median the top and the bottom of the popularityjt both in absolute and relative of movies rated by user i in month t propensityit average rating given by user i in month of the ratings given by user i in month t correlation table of variables and begin our analysis by presenting the distribution of cumulative demand at various cutoff points by year as well as by calculating the yearly gini coefficients table reports this initial check of the dynamics of the demand shift over time as can be seen from the upper part of the table cumulative demand tended to decline throughout our study period at all the absolute cutoff points suggesting that both hits and niches have had decreasing demand over time in particular demand for the top titles has declined from to over the course of five years however a different picture emerges in the bottom part of table where cutoff points are relative to active product variety we see that the top quintiles ie the hits such as the top the top and the top exhibit increasing cumulative demand over time however the bottom quintiles exhibit no obvious patterns furthermore the gini coefficients exhibit no obvious trend this initial check suggests that there might be at least partial support for hypotheses a and b it has limited statistical power in order to perform a statistical hypothesis test we aggregate demand data at the monthly rather than the annual level since demand for movies increases exponentially in our data we employ the following logarithmically transformed time series an djt ren d cutoff points according to popularity examine the dynamics of demand over the months from january to october table distribution of the cumulative demand by year cumulative of of presents the results of model we observe that the demand for the top the top and the top movies decreases while the demand for the top the top and the top of movies increases over time all coefficients are highly significant and this simple regression model has significant exploratory power these results imply that the demand for hits tends to be less and less concentrated in absolute terms but more and more concentrated in relative terms which agrees with our hypotheses a and b in particular the demand for the top of movies increases over four times as fast as the demand for the top of movies coefficients and correspondingly indicating that the demand for the of the significantly outpaces the demand for less popular movies when popularity is measured in relative terms further demand for niche movies decreases over time whether popularity is measured in absolute or relative particular the bottom movies lose demand slightly faster than the bottom and the bottom of movies coefficients and correspondingly indicating that the demand for the of the deteriorates faster than for more popular movies these results render support to hypothesis b but not a no matter how popularity is measured there is no evidence that demand for niche movies regression of hits and niches over time top the rows below the estimates are standard conclude this part of the analysis we conduct a hypothesis test of the famous pareto rule on the entire data set from to we reject the null hypothesis that of the movies contribute to of the demand with confidence t and we estimate that the top of movies constitute between and of total demand significantly more than fact the percentage of demand share for the top of movies has increased from in to in this result once again goes against the notion of the long tail effect that the top of movies will constitute a smaller and smaller share of far our econometric model is limited to capturing the time trend to provide a robustness test which controls for the movie characteristics data we utilize the combined data set from netflix and yahoo movies and employ model once again the goal is to study demand for the hits and the niches over time at both absolute and relative cutoff an djt ratingkt criticsratingk cutoff and present regression results for the hits and the niches as is clear from the tables even after controlling for movie characteristics the results of our analysis are very consistent with the results of model namely trend coefficients for the top and the top movies are and suggesting that the demand for hits decreases over time in absolute terms however the same coefficients for the top and the top of movies are and implying that the demand for hits tends to increase over time in relative evidence is consistent with our hypotheses a and b for the niches we see that demand decreases in both absolute and relative terms which is consistent with the findings in model supportive of hypotheses b but not a we note that although movie characteristics add to the explanatory power of the model there are no consistent results to report here which is not surprising given the small size of the sample in particular we find no evidence that the demand for the hits or the niches is associated with the user or critic ratings furthermore since the high in these regressions indicate potential multicollinearity problems we examine the correlation table of the variables in each regression and find no high to a smaller sample size of the combined data set the top the top the bottom and the bottom of the movies are not available in certain months therefore we drop these cutoff omit to report them in the paper because of the page regression of hits over time controlling for movie characteristics top criticsrating the columns in parentheses are standard categorical variable g is not included in the regression to avoid multicollinearity and provide nc holiday miscellaneous are small portion of the movies so they are dropped in some regressions by the statistics package regression of niches over time controlling for movie characteristics bottom criticsrating the columns in parentheses are standard categorical variable g is not included in the regression to avoid multicollinearity and provide nc holiday miscellaneous constitute a small portion of the movies so they are dropped in some regressions by the statistics package now turn our attention to examining how individual consumers change their ratings over time in order to gain insights into the analysis in particular we examine how the propensity of each consumer to discover niche movies evolves over time while controlling for observed user heterogeneity such as rating frequency and variance of ratings the data that we have lack other potentially significant consumer characteristics such as demographics in order to cope with this issue we introduce a preference for each movies through the panel data analysis and we further assume that the preference correlates with the observed characteristics of the consumer this correlation is likely to be caused by the recommendation systems which can influence an preference based on observed characteristics the hausman test hausman further provides strong evidence of this correlation therefore we employ the following regression to predict consumer propensity to rate movies varianceit top of table presents results for absolute movie rankings while the bottom of the table presents the same results for relative movie rankings using model as is evident from the top portion of the table all coefficients are positive and highly significant suggesting that the absolute popularity rankings of the movies watched by the average consumer consistently other words consumers tend to watch more and more niche movies over time when movies are ranked in absolute terms in particular the trend coefficient for the bottom th percentile of the movies that a person watches ie the obscure titles is which is times higher than the same coefficient for the top th percentile of the movies ie the popular this comparison suggests that consumers discover niche products much faster than they move away from the hits again if popularity is measured in absolute the picture changes completely when the popularity of the movies is measured in relative terms the bottom part of table shows that coefficients are consistently negative suggesting that relative to the product variety that is available at that point of time tend to watch more and more popular movies in particular the trend coefficient for the top th percentile of movies is which is about twice as high as for the bottom th percentile of movies suggesting that consumer demand shifts toward more popular hits faster than it shifts away from less popular niches taken together the results of model suggest that the growth rate of product variety is substantially higher than the speed at which consumers discover niche products this finding is consistent with the results of fleder and hosanagar that recommendation systems guide similar consumers to the same products which does not effectively help consumers discover products at the tail of the model the consistently positive and highly significant coefficients of frequency it indicate that heavier users tend to watch more niche movies in particular the coefficients for both and relative medians are in other words if an average consumer watches five more movies per month or one more movie per week the median of propensity for niche movies is likely to increase by on average holding other factors constant thus it appears that heavy users are the ones that drive toward the long tail effect nevertheless these heavy users constitute a relatively small segment of the entire population as we demonstrated earlier heavy users with a monthly frequency over the mean constitute less than of all users although this small group of people tends to watch more niche movies it does not seem to shift the entire demand from hits to niches a comparison of coefficients for the top th percentile and and coefficients for the bottom th percentile and suggests that heavier users shift away from the hits three times as fast as they discover niches that is even heavy users are not as fast in discovering niches as they are in about negative and highly significant coefficients of rating propensity it suggest that consumers who on average give higher ratings and may therefore be more satisfied tend to watch more popular movies for example the coefficients for both absolute and relative means are around which suggests that increasing the average rating by one unit is associated with a increase in the average movie popularity in other words the more popular movies generally satisfy people better than the obscure titles of course it is possible that consumers who watch popular movies are systematically different from consumers who watch niche movies in that the former tend to rate all movies higher than the latter since we are unable to observe characteristics of individual consumers out finding is subject to this we note that rating variance it is negatively associated with the median and the top th percentiles while this variable is positively associated with the mean and the bottom th percentiles in either absolute or relative we interpret these mixed signs to imply that consumers with highly disperse rating tend to watch extreme hits and niches in other words the extreme hits and the extreme niches receive more polarized ratings from those consumers further the popularity of the movies that those consumers watch tends to skew toward the niches in other words consumers with highly disperse ratings watch a larger quantity of hits than niches but the niches that they watch are generally extremely and original definition of the long tail effect by anderson states that demand for hit products will decrease while niches will constitute a larger and larger proportion of demand on the internet in this paper we argue that one has to be careful about defining hits and niches in the internet era in a world where product variety is relatively stable and all products are consumed at some rate hits and niches are typically defined in absolute terms eg the top the bottom however product variety has been skyrocketing in the internet age and therefore more and more products can be left unnoticed by consumers or are being discovered very slowly even though the customer base is also expanding to evaluate the consumer propensity to discover niches and to separate this effect from the entirely different effect of increasing product variety on the internet we suggest that product popularity should be measured in relative terms thus dynamically adjusting for the product variety at that point of time by doing this we bring the distribution of demand to a common scale and we analyze how it changes over use a novel data set that contains over million online movie ratings from to we supplement this data by movie characteristics data from yahoo movies in this large data set we find that when the popularity of a movie is defined dynamically ie in relative terms there is essentially no evidence of the long tail effect the demand for hits increases over time while the demand for niches decreases additionally even in the absolute ranking definition the long tail effect is only partially present the demand for niches decreases over time although the demand for hits decreases order to gain insights into these findings we further examine changes in the demand distribution at the consumer level once again we find that consumers over time indeed watch more niche movies in absolute terms but we also discover that the rate at which consumers shift demand from the hits to the niches is considerably lower than the growth rate of product variety therefore if we normalize product ratings for currently active product variety and measure popularity in relative terms we find that consumers tend to watch more and more hits over visually illustrates the comparison between the absolute and relative ratings of the movies that consumers watch in figure left bottom line we observe the median movie that the average consumer watched over time which has a linear upward trend indicating that consumers discover niches in particular at the beginning of our study the median movie rated by an average consumer was ranked slightly above while at the end of the study the median movie ranking had increased about seven times to over however figure left top line also indicates that product variety increased even faster which creates an impression of the lengthening tail of demand distribution there are more and more obscure movies over time however once we bring distribution to the common scale through dividing by current product variety the long tail disappears not surprisingly figure right shows that when we look at the median rating in relative terms the average consumer gravitates more and more toward hits in fact at the beginning of our study the average consumer watched on average movies in the th percentile of product variety while at the end of the study the average consumer watched movies in the th percentile hence we conclude that although consumers do venture into niches new movies appear more quickly than people can actually discover average median and relative average median popularity make a number of additional observations based on our analysis we find evidence that the consumers who give high average ratings tend to watch more popular movies hence we do not find any evidence that niche products satisfy consumer tastes better and better over time which is suggested by anderson furthermore we find that the consumers who watch the niches tend to be heavy users constituting only a small part of the entire user base light users however tend to focus on the popular items and since most users are in this category hits continue to drive the findings have a number of managerial implications as they shed new light on the controversy surrounding the long tail effect first the promise of the long tail effect became a basis for many httpaddr long our findings suggest that caution needs to be used when assessing the potential benefits of focusing a business on supplying niche products while it may be true that niche products are much more profitable for companies eg anderson suggests that niche movies cost a fraction of hit movies to make this argument does not account for the fact that for each niche product that consumers demand there might be several that are never discovered thus potentially adding to the costs but not to the revenues further a large number of products might take a while to be discovered this finding seems to suggest that much more attention needs to be paid to recommendation systems review forums and other means of aiding product discovery although netflix employs what is widely considered to be a recommendation system even this system does not allow numerous consumers to discover titles as fast as they appear this raises an important issue of carefully forecasting how long will it take for a given title once it is added to the inventory to begin accumulating demand more improvements to the recommendation systems such through the netflix prize and the algorithm proposed by park and tuzhilin should be from our analysis suggest that consumers are generally much more satisfied by hit products than by niches this is an important consideration while netflix currently httpaddr long tail we do not find any evidence to suggest that customers watching obscure titles find them more satisfactory than other movies we can speculate that many consumers over time will learn that niches are called niches for a reason and might stop watching them altogether our other observation that heavy users tend to watch more obscure movies suggests that the presence of the long tail effect might be moderated by the frequency of service in the case of netflix it is physically impossible to rent more than a few dvds per month due to the time that the mailing process however netflix and other companies such as amazon have started allowing customers to watch dvds on their computers at home right away which may increase the number of heavy users who venture into niches in this case one will have to the existence of the long tail course the production and inventory costs of media and entertainment products are steadily decreasing particularly for some purely digital products nevertheless for more traditional physical products irrational expansion into niche products can increase operational difficulties such as maintaining the level of service fisher et al randall and ulrich some companies therefore can benefit by focusing on products with the caveat that there are many more of these hits on the is important to remember the limitations of our findings first our study does not directly compare and internet companies and therefore we are unable to comment on this aspect of the long tail effect rather our findings need to be interpreted as a temporal study in the internet environment only further our findings are restricted to the ratings data which are different from rental data it is not entirely clear to us that ratings data are better or worse than rental data consumers often rate movies that they watched elsewhere providing a richer picture of demand for movies but on the other hand many consumers probably do not rate the movies that they watched an interesting future venue for research would be to compare ratings data with rental data and further to compare data for both online and stores in addition the data set with the transaction level information may be potentially used to study consumer purchase patterns and their value further research opportunities also include linking recommendation system metrics such as product ratings with operations management and marketing strategies see netessine et
