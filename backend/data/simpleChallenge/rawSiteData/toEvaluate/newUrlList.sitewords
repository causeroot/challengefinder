really book on innovation one of only about and will be useful to lots senior managers directors vice presidents and interested in trying to manage innovation initiatives it has lots plus some of the plus points its more practical than many other innovation books where good ideas come from allen lane is good but not sufficiently linked to business interests and practices by bruce and birchall ft prentice hall fastrack series very colourful and full of graphs and diagrams but maybe too for the average senior manager director or vice president to its sets out a company innovation framework and a checklist spending guidelines and expectations about performance milestones which senior managers company directors and vice presidents will able to it defines the roles of the various players and explains what can expected from them this is useful if you want to kick start in your business but are not sure who you should listen to your of it consultants knowledge management people who want to you software packages its scope is large it is concerned with i business innovation ii process innovation iii market innovation and product service innovation many other innovation books themselves to

continuous improvement mc and kroch ichijo and nonaka enabling knowledge creation oup the nonaka one is fairly academic and the liker books concentrate innovation practices in a manufacturing environment so anyone wants to learn from them has to translate what they are saying and this is not the case with winning at innovation book it is academic and is not restricted to books it would also be competing with are innovation to the transforming the way your company innovates by peter skarzynski rowan gibson the other side of innovation solving execution challenge harvard business review by vijay govindarajan chris trimble two minus the book is boringly presented one could ask would steve have been satisfied with the design and appearance of the book think the answer would be if palgrave brings out a paperback edition they could take a leaf of ft prentice innovation book by bruce and birchall they could put some color into it put the diagrams models and in color and have boxes with a coloured background and colour that would make it look like an interesting whoever wrote the book description on the dust jacket sleeve and gives the misleading impression that just a book innovation and marketing the description says that is groundbreaking new model for successful marketing advancement emphasis and perspective is much too limited and is misleading book which

have seen the movie and now have become in finding out more about evelyn ryan and her remarkable career writer my advice buy the book i grew up in ohio and actually attended school with some of the ryan clan remember very vividly when bruce won the triumph sports car for sandwich jingle it was such an exciting time for little thenbruce never drove the car to school nor did we ever see nor hair of it again i never knew why until i read the the book is very true to the times in a small town in the s lived a quieter gentler life tuff terry ryan the author was little spitfire that took no nonsense from anyone it amazed me how could write about the horrific things her father did and yet not him come off as the poster boy for father grinch of the year book focuses on her mother as a mother the keeper of the flame lighthouse beam in the dark and stormy night the book does not on the relationship between the mother and the alcoholic father egregious acts of the father in the book are very quietly into the story but tuff refrains from characterizing her father as undesirable parent tuff does not let the negativity of his influence the positivity of her love devotion and if seen the movie discard the saintly portrayal of the and the incredulous idea of everytime the ryans needed money a happened and she won a jingle contest in reality the miracles happen but the movie does not show all the times evelyn did not the book is a thousand times better than the movie and although think most people will laud the movie for its positive message and feel good quality like any

http://www.stanford.edu/~nbloom/PevertedU.pdf competition and innovation an paper investigates the relationship between product market competition and innovation we find strong evidence of an relationship using panel data we develop a model where competition discourages laggard firms from innovating but encourages firms to innovate together with the effect of competition on the equilibrium industry structure these generate an two additional predictions of the the average technological distance between leaders and followers increases with competition and that the is steeper when industries are more both supported by the have long been interested in the relationship between competition and innovation but economic theory seems to be contradicted by the evidence theories of industrial typically predict that innovation should decline with competition while empirical work finds that it increases this paper reexamines this relationship using panel data and finds clear nonlinearities in the form of an shape illustrated by figure i which plots patents against the lerner index with an exponential quadratic overlay the possibility of an between competition and innovation was hinted at by scherer who showed a positive relationship the authors would like to thank daron acemoglu william baumol bresnahan jan boone wendy carlin paul david janice eberly edward glaeser dennis ranque mark shankerman robert solow manuel trajtenberg alwyn young john van reenen two anonymous referees and participants at seminars including canadian institute of advance research harvard university and massachusetts institute of technology financial support for this project was provided by the economic and social research council esrc centre for the microeconomic analysis of public policy at the institute for fiscal studies and the advanced institute of management aim initiative the data were developed with funding from the leverhulme see our discussion in section iii below however the replacement effect in arrow and the efficiency effects in gilbert and newbury and reinganum go in the opposite see geroski nickell and blundell griffith and van by the president and fellows of harvard college and the massachusetts institute of quarterly journal of economics may journal of activity and firm size in the cross section with a impact at larger sizes when allowing for our knowledge no existing model of product market competition and innovation predicts an explanation for these results could be pieced together by combining agency models with schumpeterian models however this seems unsatisfactory instead we develop an extension of aghion harris and vickers that can fit the entire this model both current technological leaders and their followers in any industry can innovate and innovations by leaders and followers all occur innovation incentives depend not so much upon postinnovation rents as in previous endogenous growth models where all innovations are made by outsiders but upon the difference between postinnovation and preinnovation rents of incumbent firms in this case more competition may foster innovation and growth because it may reduce a preinnovation rents by more than it reduces its postinnovation rents in other words competition may increase the incremental profits from innovating and thereby encourage investments aimed at this should be particularly true in sectors where incumbent firms are operating at similar technological levels in these sectors preinnovation rents should be especially reduced by product market competition on the other hand in sectors where innovations are made by laggard firms with already low initial profits product market competition will mainly affect postinnovation rents and therefore the schumpeterian effect of competition should essence of the relationship between competition and innovation is that the fraction of sectors with competitors is itself endogenous and depends upon equilibrium innovation intensities in the different types of sectors more specifically when competition is low a larger equilibrium fraction of sectors involve competing incumbents so that overall the effect is more likely to dominate the schumpeterian effect on the other hand when competition is high the schumpeterian effect is more likely to dominate because a larger fraction of sectors in equilibrium have innovation being performed by laggard firms with low initial profits the shape is confirmed by our u k panel hart schmidt aghion dewatripont and rey see also aghion harris howitt and vickers and and it is robust to a number of controls and model provides additional testable predictions on the relationship between competition and the composition of industries and more specifically between competition and the average degree of in the economy which are also by the rest of the paper is structured as follows section ii displays the empirical evidence on the existence of an between competition and innovation section iii argues that existing models of competition and innovation cannot account for the pattern we develop a theoretical rationale for this relationship derive some additional empirical predictions and validate them with data finally section the impact of competition on early empirical literature inspired by estimated linear relationships and typically found a negative relationship between competition and innovation confirming the theoretical prejudices of the era developed this research by allowing for additional nonlinearities and in a analysis of fortune firms discovered a significant shape with higher competition initially increasing then decreasing the rate of research since then has returned to estimating linear specifications for example nickell and blundell griffith and van reenen both find a positive linear effect of competition on innovation in this paper we allow for a nonmonotonic measuring is a large literature on measuring innovation intensity with the most commonly used measures being expenditure and patenting activity we use the average number of to deal with the possible endogeneity of competition we use u k data and exploit the major policy reforms undertaken over the s and s which dramatically changed the nature and extent of competition across industries and over time the radical policies of the thatcher administration the introduction of the european single market program smp and the reforms imposed by the monopolies and mergers commission together provide a number of policy changes that vary across time and industries and allow us to identify the causal impact of competition on journal of taken out by firms in an industry and to reflect the heterogeneous value of patents we weight each patent by the number of times it has been cited by another patent these data are generated by matching the nber patents database to accounting data on firms listed on the london stock exchange from our sample includes all firms with names beginning to plus all large firms after removing firms involved in large mergers or acquisitions and those with missing data we have an unbalanced panel of firms spanning seventeen sic codes over the period we also have information on citations to and from each patent which enables us to construct a count of patents we take the average value of patents of firms within each industry sic code in each year we do not observe a sufficient number of firms in all industries in all years so our resulting industry level panel is also unbalanced with observations some descriptive statistics are provided in appendix measuring main indicator of product market competition is the lerner index or price cost margin following nickell this measure has several advantages over indicators such as market share or the herfindahl concentration index these other measures rely more directly on precise definitions of geographic and product markets which is particularly difficult in our application as many u k firms operate in international markets so that market concentration measures based only on u k data may be extremely price cost margin we use is measured by operating profits net of depreciation provisions and an estimated financial cost of capital divided by profit financial see hall jaffe and trajtenberg the nber database contains the patents taken out in the u s patent office which is where innovations are effectively patented internationally dated by the time of the cost of capital is assumed to be for all firms and time periods and the capital stock is measured using the perpetual inventory method the shape is robust to excluding this financial cost from the lerner measure principally because it is relatively small and constant over and competition measure is the average of this across firms within the i indexes firms j indexes industry t indexes time and njt is the number of firms in industry j in year t a value of perfect competition price equals marginal cost while values below indicate some degree of market power in this index we use the entire sample of stock market listed firms in each industry not only those in the patenting a nonlinear use flexible nonlinear estimators to investigate the basic shape of the relationship between competition and n as the hazard rate and c as the measure of competition we start by defining the competition innovation relationship where is some unknown that the patent process has a poisson distribution with hazard rate then the expected number of patents satisfies models that study count data processes typically base their specification on the poisson model with a parametric linear form for g c but they relax the strong assumptions on higher moments we follow this approach in our empirical analysis basing our estimator on the first moment we adopt a flexible specification for g c because we are particularly interested in allowing the data to determine the shape of the relationship between innovation and product market is very likely that different industries will have observed levels of patenting activity that have no direct causal relationship with product market competition but reflect other institutional features of the industry consequently industry fixed effects are essential to remove any spurious correlation or of this type time effects are also included to remove common shocks conditional on industry and time effects see hausman hall and griliches for journal of plot of innovation on figure plots a measure of competition on the against patents on the each point represents an the scatter shows all data points that lie in between the tenth and ninetieth deciles in the patents distribution the exponential quadratic curve that is overlaid is reported in column of table patent behavior is related to industry competition according p cjt where x represents a complete set of time and industry dummy we use moment condition to define a moment estimator and approximate g c with a spline following ai and chen figure i we show the scatter of data points in between the tenth and ninetieth deciles of the patent distribution and overlay a fitted exponential quadratic curve the same exponential quadratic curve is plotted together with a spline approximation in figure ii it can be seen that the exponential quadratic specification provides a very reasonable approximation to the nonparametric spline and that they both show a clear shape the estimated coefficients for the exponential quadratic model are presented in table i the first column shows that both the linear and quadratic terms are individually and jointly significant in the second column we reestimate including industry effects which is our preferred specification competition and and competition exponential quadratic and the semiparametric specifications with year and industry figure plots a measure of competition on the against patents on the each point represents an the circles show the exponential quadratic curve that is reported in column of table i the triangles show a nonparametric which removes the bias that results from correlation between permanent levels of innovative activity and product market competition and again find a significant underlying distribution of the data is shown by the intensity of the points on the estimated curves these indicate that the peak of the inverted u lies near the median of the distribution the median is so that industries are well spread across the we can also see that a linear relationship would yield a positive slope confirming the results presented in nickell before moving to the results using the policy instruments we consider three robustness checks the first uses averages to estimate this relationship in view of the potential lags in the relationship between competition and innovation as shown in the third column of table i this also displays a clear shape the second robustness check not shown uses expenditure as an alternative innovation measure again we find an shape although due to a the data span a year period to therefore the first period was set at seven years with the remainder at five years journal of quadratic basic variable of competition of policy reduced of other reduced functions in of reduced jt is measured by lerner index in the all columns are estimated using an unbalanced panel of seventeen industries over the period to estimates are from a poisson regression numbers in brackets are standard errors the standard errors in column have not been corrected for the inclusion

specified in table ii imports over in the same tfp in the same output minus variable costs over output in the same and estimates of markups from regression martins et al interacted with time trend all for the united states and smaller sample the coefficients are not statistically significant finally we fit the relationship for each of the top four innovating industries in our sample and in each case there is part or all of an shape see the earlier working paper version of this paper aghion et al using policy major obstacle to empirical research in this area is that competition and innovation are mutually endogenous without addressing this any results we find are likely to be biased toward in the united kingdom was not a mandatory reporting item prior to so it is not available for the majority of firms prior to this date this is one of the reasons we use patents as our main innovation and but differential market action action and action a more negative relationship between competition and innovation if higher levels of innovation act for example to reduce competition we address this problem by using a set of policy instruments that provide exogenous variation in the degree of industrywide competition since we are including industry and time effects this approach identifies the competition effect through the differential timing of the introduction of policy changes across industries the three sets of policy instrument used are the thatcher era privatizations the eu single market programme and the monopoly and merger commission investigations that resulted in structural or behavioral remedies being imposed on the industry table ii lists the policy instruments that are used the industries that are affected and the in which the policy changes use these policy variables to instrument the changes in competition these policy changes were driven by a combination of political orthodoxy desires for european integration and responses to anticompetitive behavior with little obvious link to innovation performance we specify a model for the competition see for example the endogenous barrier to entry story in sutton see the earlier working paper version for full details of all the policy instruments aghion et al the single market program differentially increased trade liberalization across u k industries in all tariff and nontariff barriers were phased out with the increase in competition depending on the extent of tariff and nontariff barriers the european cechinni report ranked all sic industries into low medium and high impact and we use this ranking for our policy instrument journal of assumes that e v z x where z denote the policy the idea is then to use functions of the v in an extended version of the moment condition to strip out any element of is endogenous with the error control function assumption can be expressed as xjt that controlling for the conditional moment condition to retrieve the conditional moment fourth column in table i shows the estimates for our exponential quadratic specification that control for endogeneity using our set of instruments the coefficient estimates are similar to the second column in the bottom part of the table we present some diagnostic statistics they show that the instruments are significant in the reduced form that the policy instruments in particular are significant and that they have explanatory relationship between innovation and product market competition for the standard quadratic and also for the instrumented quadratic display a similar explaining the inverted main existing theories of competition and innovation in this subsection we briefly summarize what existing theories have to say about the relationship between competition and innovation or competition and productivity growth as it turns out none of them can account for the pattern in the previous leading io models of product differentiation and monopolistic competition namely salop and dixit and deliver the prediction that more intense product market competition reduces postentry rents and therefore reduces the equilibrium number of entrants thus these models can only account for the decreasing part of the curve increased to recover the parameters of interest we integrate over the empirical distribution of v and recover the structural see blundell and powell increased product market competition is modeled as a reduction in unit transport cost in salop or as an increase in the substitutability between differentiated products in dixit and stiglitz and market competition discourages innovation by reducing postentry rents this prediction is shared by most existing models of endogenous growth eg romer aghion and and grossman and helpman where an increase in product market competition or in the rate of imitation has a negative effect on productivity growth by reducing the monopoly rents that reward new all the papers firms are simply individuals instead hart considers the case of firms run by managers who do not value profits per se but yet draw private benefits from maintaining the firm afloat and thereby keeping their job then increased competition may induce otherwise reluctant managers to put more effort into reducing costs in order to avoid bankruptcy however this does not generate an relationship between competition and managerial incentives either most firms have managers who are a sufficiently residual claimant over the monetary revenue in which case we again obtain a negative correlation between competition and innovation or they are run by satisficing managers in which case competition is unambiguously good for a theoretical is a unit mass of identical consumers each supplying a unit of labor inelastically with a constant rate of intertemporal discount r and a logarithmic instantaneous utility function u y ln y the consumption good y is produced at each date t input services from a continuum of intermediate sectors according to the production y which each x is an aggregate of two intermediate goods by duopolists in sector j defined by the subutility function in these models the reason why competition policy is unambiguously detrimental to growth is the same as the reason why patent protection is unambiguously good for growth patent protection raises monopoly rents from innovation whereas increased product market competition destroys these this positive effect of competition disappears if managers value monetary payoffs sufficiently as shown by scharfstein and more recently by journal of logarithmic structure of implies that in equilibrium individuals spend the same amount on each basket x we this common amount to unity by using current expenditure as the numeraire for the prices each the representative household chooses each x and to the budget constraint p firm produces using labor as the only input according to a production function and takes the wage rate as given thus the unit costs of production c and c of the firms in an industry are independent of the quantities produced now let k denote the technology level of duopoly firm i in some industry j that is one unit of labor currently employed by firm i generates an output flow equal to a is a parameter that measures the size of a innovation equivalently it takes ki units of labor for firm i to produce one unit of output the state of an industry is then fully characterized by a pair of integers l m where l is the technology and m is the technology gap of the leader over the follower we define respectively to be the profit flow of a firm m steps ahead of respectively behind its expositional simplicity we assume that knowledge spillovers between leader and follower in any intermediate industry are such that the maximum sustainable gap is m that is if a firm already one step ahead innovates the lagging firm will automatically learn to copy the previous technology and thereby remain only one step behind thus at any point in time there will be two kinds of intermediate sectors in the economy i leveled or sectors where both firms are at technological par with one another so that m ii unleveled sectors where one firm the leader lies one step ahead of its competitor the laggard or follower in the same industry so that m the above logarithmic technology along with the cost structure c x x k implies that the profit in the industry depends only on the gap m between the two firms and not on absolute levels of aghion et al analyze the more general case where m is however unlike in this section that paper provides no solution for the equilibrium levels and the industry structure competition and spending the cost n n in units of labor a leader or frontier firm moves one technological step ahead with a poisson hazard rate of n we call n the of the firm we assume that a follower firm can move one step ahead with hazard rate h even if it spends nothing on by copying the technology thus n is the cost of a follower firm moving ahead with a hazard rate n let n denote the intensity of each firm in a industry and let denote the intensity of a follower in an unleveled industry if n denotes the intensity of leader in an unleveled industry note that n since our of automatic means that a leader cannot gain any further advantage by model the degree of product market competition inversely by the degree to which the two firms in a industry are able to collude they do not collude when the industry is unlevel thus the laggard in an unlevel industry makes zero profit while the leader makes a profit equal to the difference between its revenue which we have normalized to unity and its cost which is times its revenue given that its price is times its unit firm in a level industry earns a profit of if the firms are unable to collude since they are in bertrand competition with identical products and identical unit costs and if there is collusion more generally we assume we parameterize product market competition by that is one minus the fraction of a profits that the level firm can attain through collusion note that is also the incremental profit of an innovator in a industry normalized by the next analyze how the equilibrium research intensities n and consequently the aggregate innovation rate vary our measure of therefore cannot formally establish qualitative results such as the existence of an relationship between competition and innovation or characterize the relationship between competition and the distribution of technological journal of the schumpeterian and effects we assume that the equilibrium innovation rates n and n determined by the necessary conditions for a symmetric equilibrium in which each firm seeks to maximize expected discounted profits with a discount rate r in appendix we the equilibrium research intensity by each firm increases with higher product market competition whereas the equilibrium research intensity of a laggard firm decreases with higher product market competition latter effect on is the basic schumpeterian effect results from reducing the rents that can be captured by a follower who succeeds in catching up with its rival by former effect on n we refer to as an namely that more competition induces firms to innovate in order to escape competition since the incremental value of getting ahead is increased with higher pmc on average an increase in product market competition will thus have an ambiguous effect on growth it induces faster productivity growth in currently sectors and slower growth in currently unleveled sectors the overall effect on growth will thus depend on the fraction of leveled versus unleveled sectors but this fraction is itself endogenous since it depends upon equilibrium intensities in both types of sectors we proceed to show under which condition this overall effect is an inverted u and at the same time derive additional predictions for further empirical respectively denote the probability being an unleveled respectively any unit time interval the probability that a sector moves from being unleveled to leveled is n h we have established by numerical simulation that all of our results hold with r and probability that it moves in the opposite direction is n in state these two probabilities must be equal n together with the fact that implies that the flow of innovations n n n now analyze how this flow varies with product market competition and establish the possibility of an pattern since by proposition n is an increasing function of we use n as our proximate measure of product market which in turn will prove convenient when deriving our main predictions below note that n takes values on the h h h h with x to maximum collusion and x to maximum competition we have whenever the value h is to the interval the aggregate innovation rate n an pattern it increases with competition n for all n and decreases for all n if then the aggregate innovation rate increases with n for n so that the effect always if then it decreases with n for all n so that the schumpeterian effect always each of these cases arises for a nonempty subset of parameter see appendix shape can be explained as follows when there is not much product market competition there is hardly any incentive for firms to innovate and therefore the overall innovation rate will be highest when the sector is unleveled thus the industry will be quick to leave the unleveled state which it does as soon as the laggard innovates and slow to leave the leveled state which will not happen until one of the firms as a result the industry will spend most of the time in the leveled state where the effect dominates decreasing in in if the degree of competition is very low to begin with an journal of in competition should result in a faster average innovation the other hand when competition is initially very high there is relatively little incentive for the laggard in an unleveled state to innovate thus the industry will be relatively slow to leave the unleveled state meanwhile the large incremental profit gives firms in the leveled state a relatively large to innovate so that the industry will be relatively quick to leave the leveled state as a result the industry will spend most of the time in the unleveled state where the schumpeterian effect is at work on the laggard while the leader never other words if the degree of competition is very high to begin with an increase in competition should result in a slower average innovation that according to this model the empirical measure c of competition that we used in the previous section has an expected value is in accordance with equation above the industry average lerner index in an uneven industry is since the has a lerner of zero whereas the industry average lerner index in a leveled industry is the lerner index of each firm equal to its profits divided by its revenue show in appendix that in our the empirical measure c defined by is a increasing function of the theoretical measure in the other additional predictions on technological spread and addition to providing a rationale for the pattern uncovered in the previous section the model delivers two additional predictions which are summarized in the following two propositions and which we prove in appendix thus the reason why the effect dominates when competition is low whereas the schumpeterian effect on laggards dominates when competition is intense is the of competition on the distribution of technology gaps across and the expected technological gap in an industry increases with product market intuition is simple we know that the higher the degree of product market competition the higher the research intensity in sectors and the lower the research intensity in unleveled sectors this in turn implies that any sector will spend a higher fraction of its time being unleveled so that on average over time the technological gap between firms in that sector will be higher by the law of large numbers the same will be true for the economy as a whole at any point in next proposition is equally intuitive it states the existence of a positive interaction between the effect and the average distance of the industry to its frontier in the sense that in industries where firms are closer to their technological frontier over time the effect tends to be stronger that is the increasing part of the inverted u tends to be more precisely suppose that there are industries with large spillover parameter h and industries with small with large h will tend to be more on average over time now we can compare the magnitude of the effect across industries with different values of h and establish the peak of the inverted u is larger and occurs at a higher degree of competition in more industries more formally let be the incremental profit at which x h then both and are increasing see appendix testing the technological spread predictions to empirically assess the predictions on the technological spread and competition relationship we first need a measure of the size of the technology gap between firms within an capture this by the proportional distance a firm is from the technological frontier as measured by total factor formally we this is formally established in appendix in the remark following the proof of proposition journal of f denotes the frontier firm with the highest tfp and i denotes nonfrontier firms so at the firm level m and we use an industry level measure m that is the across firms in the industry a lower value of mjt indicates that firms in industry j are technologically closer to the frontier and therefore more like the firms in our theoretical section while a high value of m indicates a technological gap with the frontier so that firms in those industries are more like laggard firms in an unleveled first key prediction on the technological spread is that in equilibrium the average technology gap between leaders and followers should be an increasing function of the overall level of industrywide competition so that average should be a decreasing function of this is tested and confirmed in table iii which reports the results from regressing the industry average technology gap on the lerner index with a full set of year dummies first column and a full set of year and industry dummies second in both cases there is a significantly positive coefficient suggesting that industries with greater levels of competition have a higher average spread in technology within the industry and a lower degree of technology result is perhaps surprising because the static intuition is that higher competition should reduce the spread of increasing the exit rate of low tfp firms truncating the lower tail of the distribution but empirically we find this static effect of competition appears to be dominated by a more dynamic effect to increase the rate of innovation as firms innovate to try to escape competition they increase the spread of tfp within the industry dominating any potential selective exit second theoretical prediction is that the relationship between competition and growth should be steeper in more industries to assess this prediction we consider a subsample of our with below median technological are the more industries figure iii shows our baseline fitted exponential quadratic curve as well as an exponential quadratic curve fitted to the subsample of high and gap and exponential quadratic with squared squared gap jt is measured by lerner index in the technology gap jt is measured by the average distance to the tfp frontier firm across all firms in the so it is an inverse measure of all columns estimated using an unbalanced panel of yearly observations on seventeen industries over the period to significance tests show likelihood ratio and from the of joint significance numbers in brackets are standard errors the standard errors in columns and have not been corrected for the inclusion of the control features stand out clearly first more industries show a higher level of innovation activity for any level of product market competition second the curve is steeper for the more industries which accords well with our theoretical predictions these differences are statistically significant as shown in columns and of table ii which reports the quadratic coefficients for the whole sample and the high industry subsample including a full set of year dummies third column and a full set of year and industry dummies fourth the interaction terms are jointly significant in both journal of and competition the split the figure plots a measure of competition on the against patents on the each point represents an the circles show the exponential quadratic curve that is reported in column of table i the triangles show the exponential quadratic curve estimated only on industries that is reported in column of table paper investigates the relationship between product market competition pmc and innovation using a flexible nonlinear estimator we find evidence that the relationship takes the form of an shape with industries distributed across both the increasing and decreasing sections of the this is robust to a number of alternative specifications including identifying the causal impact of competition by exploiting a series of major policy reforms in the united understand what is driving this shape we extend the current theoretical literature on innovation to produce a model that delivers an prediction in this model competition may increase the incremental profit from innovating labeled the but competition may also reduce innovation incentives for laggards labeled the the balance between these two and changes between low and high levels of competition generating an relationship in addition this extension of the theory provides two new predictions first the equilibrium degree of technological among firms should decrease with pmc and second the higher the average degree of in an industry the steeper the between pmc and innovation we take these two additional predictions to the data and find them to be consistent with the data this dual empirical and theoretical approach provides useful results on the impact of competition and closeness in technology space on innovation and also a model to understand this and experiment with potential policy of proposition solve for the equilibrium research intensities n and n and laggard firms we use bellman precisely let denote the steady of being currently a leader respectively a follower in an industry with technology gap m and let r denote the rate of time discount we have the following bellman equations v v v words the annuity value rv of currently being a leader in an industry with gap m at date t equals the current profit flow minus the expected capital loss n v v from having the follower catch up by one step with leader the annuity value of currently being a laggard equal to the current profit flow plus the expected capital h v v from catching up with the leader the cost finally in the bellman equation a firm there is no help factor h because there is no leader and denotes the intensity by the other firm it follows by the same argument as used in aghion et al that the equilibrium real wage rate will equal unity given our choice to normalize expenditures equal to journal of the same sector in a symmetric nash equilibrium both intensities are equal that using the fact that each firm chooses its own to maximize its current value that is to maximize the side of the corresponding bellman equation we obtain the the between the bellman equations and conditions to yield the reduced form n r n r h n n system is recursive as the first equation solves for n and given n the second equation solves for for the where r we use the relationship to obtain h n immediately see that whereas with higher product market competition this establishes proposition of proposition n from equation this and equation n and to equation b x h h we can reexpress the aggregate innovation rate as x b x b b x x decreasing in x with a unique value which f x therefore x is with x as x therefore the pattern will obtain whenever the effect will dominate if and the schumpeterian effect will always dominate if let one can easily establish that the pattern will obtain whenever effect will strictly dominate over the whole interval whenever the schumpeterian effect will dominate over the whole interval journal of of the corresponding three regions is nonempty which establishes proposition of proposition equations and we b b is defined in the proof of proposition above from this and b n n b b n n b n b from this and proposition n b n b n we need only show n n clearly holds when so suppose that then we need only show n n follows from equations and n b n n h n h n n h and n n implies condition of proposition that the expected technological gap is given by n n can be reexpressed n b n latter expression is clearly increasing in n and therefore product market competition this establishes proposition the expected technological n decreasing in h this stems from the fact that n is decreasing h whereas h is increasing in h to see the former note from equation n the latter follows from this and equation n h n h n n journal of of proposition h h will affect and via its positive effect on b assume that is interior to the interval from the envelope theorem the marginal effect of b max just equal to the direct x b x b is unambiguously positive the marginal effect of h is e h which is therefore also positive therefore more industries those with larger h have a higher peak in the inverted u moreover the peak occurs at the value of such that x n or equivalently h h peak lies farther to the right on the line in more industries if dh where is implicitly defined by applying the implicit functions theorem to we get h h dh this establishes proposition summary iv presents the descriptive statistics on our unbalanced panel spanning industries from to and weighted gap sample is an unbalanced panel of yearly

process development training etc and that handoff can go wrong the team may not fully believe in the idea and if their heart is not it nor is their mind but more insidiously the commercialization may be too uncritical and launch the idea exactly as conceived this the biggest trap when we look at successful innovation yes product or service as launched is similar to the original idea but is not so design teams with this handoff in mind make sure that there is extended team of stakeholders who have responsibility for the innovation process and make sure there is at least one person from commercialization team who starts off in the ideation team they feel ownership of the idea and more importantly having been part the deliberation process in the conception phase will be comfortable

innovator innovation in corporate perspective on innovation the abraham lincoln a innovator main anxiety dream rugby team innovating takes teamwork properly selected using a facilitated systematic method will outperform ad hoc using divergent less structured methods such as brainstorming do you create the dream team for an innovation project there three key factors team roles diversity and a carefully selected team for innovation will have specific roles can make or break it not just during the innovation sessions afterward too the most essential role not surprising is leader the team captain is the one who gives momentum and to a team in terms of where it will innovate here is the catch team leader must be a full participant in the innovation the leader cannot be an occasional part time member who surfs in out while attending other business that shows a lack of the leader misses opportunities to reward team members and misses sense of team direction and excitement around new ideas the also plays an essential role of being the the group stopping ideas that he or she knows do not fit the vision of franchise or company this prevents teams from wasting time on ideas so they can channel their ideation in more productive another essential role is that of innovation these people have an immense passion for the business and know how work behind the scenes to get things done they are champions breakers operatives they subvert the formal organizational to get ideas approved and adopted they have a good eye for ideas excite and energize senior management while leaders are the subversives are the diversity is a driver of innovation the unique backgrounds individuals help teams be more productive and innovative helps people see more possibilities my observation is that it a different and stronger sense of group accountability groups cause people to bring their best thinking to behave and to maintain their status in the group in a positive light types of diversity are essential for dream teams functional and cultural functional diversity demands that the team have representation three parts of the business commercial marketing technical and operations these three perspectives the key questions will customers want it how do we make it how do we commercialize it having all three groups yields ideas and it creates an immediate sense of alignment about which are the gender diversity is essential element of dream teams the ideal is men and women process ideation differently and hold each other accountable in a different way without diversity teams produce a larger share of uninteresting unsupportable finally is cultural diversity the best teams have from different parts of the world they bring the nuances and about local market preferences and norms they broaden the perspective on how best to commercialize new inventions on a scale without this teams produce a larger share of parochial ideas that satisfy only one regional dream teams use a facilitated systematic innovation process members need to train and build muscle to stay in shape use a combination of ideation processes as well a group processes such as the debono six thinking the dream for major projects the preferred team size is to here is ideal pick for just about any innovation project with equal mix of and women from different geographies the first four are for the

http://elsa.berkeley.edu/users/gilbert/wp/competition_and_innovation.pdf chapter and j department of justice and the federal trade commission have frequently raised innovation concerns as reasons to challenge mergers this chapter surveys the economic theories of innovation incentives and considers how the theory may inform antitrust analysis for merger investigations and other conduct that involve can promote innovation by reducing the value of failing to invest in research and development however with intellectual property rights competition can reduce innovation incentives by lowering profits there is some empirical support for these economic theories the chapter concludes that economics can inform antitrust analysis for mergers and other conduct that could affect innovation although it is important that antitrust analysis carefully consider the key factors that drive innovation us antitrust enforcement has largely focused on arrangements that increase prices market structure and conduct also may affect the supply of new products and improvements to existing products with enormous consequences for economic welfare recently the effects of market structure on innovation have gained in importance as a consideration in antitrust policy and in the thinking of the antitrust agencies the change is particularly notable in merger policy the antitrust agencies now commonly challenge mergers in part due to a concern that the mergers will delay or prevent chapter reviews the economic literature relating incentives for innovation to market structure and conduct the emphasis in this chapter is on the relationship if any between competition in market and incentives to invest in research and development for products this chapter does not deal with competitive effects that may occur in markets for goods and services other than to professor of economics university of california at berkeley the author has benefited from various discussions and collaborations on this topic with jonathan baker joseph farrell michael katz and willard tom philip nelson and henry mcfarland provided helpful comments on an earlier draft this chapter is derived from gilbert it emphasizes the antitrust policy implications of the relationship between competition and innovation and complements other surveys such as kamien and schwartz scherer van cayseele nelson et al and katz and shelanski that arrangements affect the development of new products or processes nor does this chapter deal with other related topics such as joint ventures information spillovers network effects standards and compatibility competition and span many topics and this chapter intentionally limits the scope to make the task enforcements actions of the department of justice doj and the federal trade commission ftc reflect a belief that innovation benefits from more competitive market structures this chapter asks whether economic theory and evidence support this view section describes the changing role of innovation in merger policy section theoretical results linking market structure to innovation incentives and also briefly deals with the issue of diversity in paths section describes empirical studies that relate competition to investments and innovative outputs section the theoretical and empirical conclusions about the relationship between competition and innovation and offers some limited recommendations for competition innovation concerns in merger enforcement statistics illustrate the increased importance of innovation concerns in antitrust policy until the the doj and the ftc rarely mentioned innovation as a reason to challenge a merger as shown in table from until the doj and the ftc alleged adverse impacts on innovation in only about of all merger challenges from to the agencies cited adverse innovation effects in of merger challenges the concerns about innovation effects continued to increase in the first part of the new century from to the doj and innovation effects as a reason to challenge the merger in of merger challenges to mergers and annual reports to congress agency complaints and news shown are fiscal years which start on october challenges to banking mergers are the rapid ascent of innovation effects as a factor in merger challenges is even more dramatic than these numbers suggest in recent years the agencies have almost always cited innovation effects when challenging mergers in industries that involve significant investments in research and development for example the fifteen mergers in fy and filed complaints in district courts in nine of these mergers in six of these complaints the doj alleged that the merger if allowed to proceed would reduce innovation the three mergers in which the doj did not allege innovation effects were in waste hauling television programming and dairies the a total of mergers in fy and issued complaints in nine cases three of which alleged adverse effects on innovation the affected industries were process engineering simulation software high performance organic pigments and pharmaceuticals all industries with significant expenditures the mergers in which the ftc did not allege innovation effects were in food processing and retailing natural gas distribution clinical lab testing services and the marketing but not research development or manufacture of in the ratio of expenditures to net sales was in computer systems design and related services and in pharmaceuticals compared to for all industries source national science foundation table while the agencies raised innovation concerns in many mergers innovation was central to the antitrust enforcement decision in only a very few in the vast majority of these enforcement decisions the transactions raised conventional concerns about adverse price impacts and it is likely that the mergers would have been challenged without regard to innovation effects gilbert and tom nonetheless these enforcement statistics show a sharply increasing tendency to incorporate innovation concerns in merger challenges by the doj and ftc over a period of time that has spanned both democratic and republican the antitrust concerns for innovation effects are not limited to mergers innovation issues were prominent in the antitrust case charging microsoft with monopolizing the markets for personal computer operating systems and internet browsers the department of justice and states accused microsoft of engaging in practices that excluded competition and harmed claimed that its actions were consistent with vigorous competition that stimulated research and development of new internet browsing technologies after many years of legal the case concluded with a settlement that imposed modest restrictions on concerns with innovation effects however remain agencies have never proven to a court that a merger threatens innovation that may be because only a few merger cases have been fully litigated in the past fifteen years and those that were litigated did not highlight innovation as a reason to challenge the until only five mergers challenged by the doj and ftc were litigated to a final verdict of these five cases only two were in industries sungard data and the doj did not allege that the merger of sungard and comdisco would adversely affect innovation the an allegation of adverse effects on innovation in its complaint to block the merger of oracle and peoplesoft while oracle argued that the merger would promote the microsoft case did not achieve a consensus view of the effects of market power on innovation the department of justice argued that but for conduct which included tying of its internet explorer browser to its operating system continued competition on the merits between navigator and internet explorer would have resulted in greater innovation and the development of better products at lower prices complaint us us district court for the district of columbia civil action no the district court concluded that anticompetitive actions trammeled the competitive process through which the computer software industry generally stimulates innovation and conduces to the optimum benefit of conclusions of law us v microsoft court for the district of columbia civil action no tpj at the court of appeals found that applying a per se rule against tying of the browser and the operating stunt valuable us v microsoft us court of appeals for the district of columbia decided june and remanded the case to the district court for further review after which the parties the five cases are tenet healthcare heinz sungard data comdisco arch coal and another case settled after extensive neither side presented a detailed analysis of innovation effects at trial the district court was not persuaded by innovation efficiency defense but it did not block the merger because it held that the merger would not adversely affect price antitrust approach to innovation effects in mergers is based on the concept of innovation markets the agencies describe innovation markets in the antitrust guidelines for the licensing of intellectual property april whose publication preceded the sharp increase in the share of merger enforcement actions that involved innovation effects the ip guidelines note that an arrangement can affect price or output in three types of markets a market for existing goods and services a technology market consisting of intellectual property that is licensed and its close substitutes and an innovation market consisting of the research and development directed to particular new or improved goods or processes and the close substitutes for that research and number of criticisms have been leveled at the innovation market assert that an innovation market cannot be a valid element of an antitrust analysis because is not an accepted market under section of the clayton act except perhaps for performed under contract another criticism is that is only an input to the production of goods and services and antitrust analysis should focus on outputs the actual supply of future goods and and innovation markets are useful to the extent that they serve as analytical tools to predict changes in the price or output of goods and services for example suppose two firms each own a patent that describes a technology to broadcast high definition television signals they assign the patents to a single firm which sets the royalty and license terms for both patents antitrust enforcers may be concerned that the joint marketing will lead to higher prices and would analyze the combination in a technology market the concern is not specifically about higher royalties but rather on the price and delivery of high definition television signals to consumers it is convenient however to analyze effects in the upstream technology market just as it is convenient to analyze the effects of combinations on prices of intermediate goods when the ultimate concern is the price and supply of final goods and services to consumers similarly it can us et al v oracle corporation findings of fact conclusions of law and order thereon district court for the northern district of california no c this concept was earlier introduced by baxter he argued that mergers and joint ventures can affect competition in three dimensions the market for the goods and services presently being offered by the participants to the merger or joint venture the market for the goods and services that may be delivered if the merger or joint venture is successful and the process itself activity of research and development is also a market and it need not be or even resemble the market in which goods and services are being see eg hoerner and davis for a different view see dahdouh and mongoven convenient albeit controversial to analyze the effect of an arrangement on the supply of new goods and services by studying the impacts of the arrangement on have argued that a superior alternative to the innovation markets approach is to use the tools of potential competition theory eg hoerner potential competition theory recognizes two types of harms a merger can affect potential competition by eliminating a significant present competitive threat that constrains the behavior of the firms already in the market harm to potential or by eliminating a likely future competitor harm to potential resulting in a lost opportunity for improvement in market performance from the addition of a significant competitor the theory of harm to perceived potential competition follows the economic theory of limit pricing in which a firm or industry restrains its price to reduce the risk of future entry if a merger eliminates a firm with unique advantages from entering the market the firms in the market might be able to set a new and higher price after the merger eliminates the entry in the structure of an innovation market can sometimes be likened to changes in actual potential competition as the following example illustrates suppose that two firms x and y are engaged in research to develop a new drug to treat type and agree to merge their operations neither firm has a therapy to treat this disease each firm is a potential entrant into the market for drugs that treat type the merger eliminates one of these potential entrants and thus could result in higher prices or lower output of drugs to treat type diabetes the analysis would have to consider the likelihood that each firm would develop a successful drug if they did not merge and the competitive conditions in the market for type diabetes therapies with and without the entry of new drug from each of the firms the analysis would also have to consider possible efficiency advantages from the merger such as improvements to their programs from combining both of their a practical matter however it would not be easy to evaluate competitive effects in this hypothetical merger using potential competition theory analysis of actual potential competition typically supposes that one of the firms is already an established supplier of the relevant good and service here neither firm is established in the industry moreover for firms that are engaged in markets for the products they are developing may not presently exist as a further example suppose that firms x and developing new types of therapies based on stem cell technologies that have potential applications for the treatment of spinal cord injuries for which no therapies currently exist potential competition theory would not directly apply to a merger of x and y because there is no existing relevant antitrust market in which either firm is a potential competitor this does not mean it would be impossible to perform a potential competition analysis it would however require a probabilistic analysis in which in united states v chemical co us the supreme court accepted a theory of perceived potential competition although neither firm was a competitor in the relevant market but the court has not done the same for cases involving actual potential competition see dahdouh and mongoven which also discusses why potential competition theory is not a substitute for an analysis of innovation competition in many effects would be evaluated under different scenarios of successful drug development weighted by the probabilities that each scenario would some innovation effects cannot be captured using the tools of potential competition theory potential competition theory would not be directly applicable to evaluate the possibility that a merger of the two firms would delay the introduction of the new drug as opposed to changing the structure of the new market by eliminating one of the potential suppliers of the new therapy nor would potential competition theory have been useful in one of the first innovation market cases when the doj challenged the proposed acquisition of the truck transmission division of zf friedrichshafen by gm the merger would have lessened actual price competition between gm and europe where the two firms were the largest suppliers but not in the us because not a significant supplier in the us market the theory was that competition between gm and zf in europe propelled innovation by the two companies and this competition would be lost if the companies merged the merger threatened with the loss of better products that gm would develop as a consequence of innovation competition in europe and then sell in the united in some circumstances an innovation markets analysis can be a superior approach to analyze the effects of the merger on the performance of research and development an innovation markets analysis however does not eliminate all the difficulties raised by a potential competition analysis it is still necessary to show how the change in market structure due to the merger would adversely affect and the output of goods of difficulty with innovation markets analysis is that the sources of may be difficult to identify discoveries can come from unexpected places thus it may be impossible to identify or measure the significance of competitors in innovation force of this objection clearly depends on the industry in question for example it is unlikely that within a time frame of several years the discovery of a new gene therapy to treat macular degeneration would come from a firm that is not in some way already involved in research and development of pharmaceuticals or more fundamental problem of innovation market analysis is that economic theory does not describe an unambiguous link between the structure of and the supply of new goods and services in particular a decrease in the number of firms engaged in can accelerate the introduction of a new product and reduce its cost by making it easier for the successful firm to capture the results of the program a point made by joseph schumpeter and and by eliminating redundant united states v general motors civil action no ddc see gilbert and sunshine for a discussion of the enforcement issues in this the parties abandoned the innovations sometimes come from different industries see eg henderson baker notes that market leaders innovate in some industries while smaller competitors have been most innovative in other is an input to production not an output and more does not necessarily imply more goods and services this issue will be considered in the next two incentives for innovation under different market structures economic theory supports neither the view that market power generally threatens innovation by lowering the return to innovative efforts nor the schumpeterian view that concentrated markets generally promote innovation by providing a stable platform to fund and by making it easier for the firm to capture its benefits the incentive to innovate is the increase in profit that a firm can earn if it invests in this incentive can be decomposed into several economic forces that are present to a greater or lesser degree in different market environments the economic force underlying the schumpeterian view is the profit that can be earned from a new product or process which depends on the size of the innovation and the extent to which the innovation is protected from imitators a product market that is highly concentrated after innovation the market for using terminology can reward innovation if the factors that lead to high concentration also make it difficult for others to profit by imitating the invention a second economic force is the profit that is eliminated by an innovation if the profit that can be earned using a legacy technology is high as may be the case in highly concentrated product markets before innovation occurs the market in terminology then the incentive to innovate which is the increase in profit from the innovation can be third force is the reduction in competition that can occur when innovation allows a firm to differentiate its products or achieve significantly lower production et al call this the market structure and the incentives for are simultaneously determined as sutton demonstrates firms have incentives to invest in if market competition allows them to profit from their investments however the extent of post competition is itself determined by decisions that changes costs and qualities will change incentives for competition which in turn changes incentives for firms to maintain a dominant position or to leapfrog a strong a firm in an oligopoly may invest in not only to achieve lower production costs or produce better products but also to change the competitive dynamic in the industry lower production costs can cause the innovating firm to increase its output causing competitors to react and lower their outputs innovation in this situation see eg rapp carlton and gertner and katz and shelanski that combinations of firms may provide superior research and development robert pitofsky former chair of the us federal trade commission proposed a narrow defense for mergers that facilitate pitofsky see also boone bonanno and haworth examine the effects of competition on the direction of the firm both by lowering its costs and by increasing its equilibrium output the former is a direct effect while the latter is a strategic effect on competition in this case the strategic effect is an additional inducement to invest in a process fourth force is the incentive to preempt competition a firm with market power may be able to preserve its market power by innovating to deter the entry of rivals in some circumstances this preemption incentive can neutralize the disincentive for innovation that arises when an innovation eliminates profits earned with a legacy technology successful preemption however requires a number of conditions including a dominant firm that can internalize most of the benefits of an investment that deters in research and development competition in the process in terminology has effects on the amount and timing of that differ from competition in the product markets before and after innovation occurs if the outcome of is highly uncertain then increasing the number of firms engaged in a race to patent a new innovation generally reduces the expected arrival time of the the number of firms engaged in may have no effect on the timing of innovation if the output of is relatively predictable and if one firm is far ahead of its rivals in the race to invent fudenberg et al complexity of the relationship between innovation and market power or market structure stems from the large number of factors that may influence the incentives to innovate and their often opposing effects these factors depend on the nature of intellectual property protection characteristics of the invention the extent of competition before and after innovation and the dynamics of determining the overall incentive to innovate requires answering many questions including the following what property rights exist to protect the the invention protected by patent and if so is the patent easy or difficult to invent around are there other mechanisms to protect an innovator from is the nature of the it a process or a new product is it a minor advance or does it have the potential to disrupt the industry hierarchy does it complement a other products does it require fundamentally different capabilities to make or use than currently exist in the in other examples the strategic effect can go the other way the innovating firm may reduce its price to reflect its lower costs competitors may react to the lower price by reducing their prices which would lower the net benefit from the process innovation this strategic effect would reduce the incentive to invest in a process innovation see bester and petrakis see eg loury dasgupta and stiglitz b lee and wilde and gilbert and sunshine is the extent of competition and the innovator a participant in a highly competitive market or a firm that is largely protected from competition is price or product differentiation important in the industry are there significant barriers to does require specialized assets that are not widely available or is it something that almost anyone can do is the inventor also the innovator or does the inventor plan to license sell or assign the invention to a different are the dynamics of competition and the stochastic nature of is necessarily uncertain are the outcomes of programs reasonably predictable or a shot in the dark can firms observe and respond to activities can firms coordinate their activities to avoid redundant an inventor can retain and exploit exclusive rights to her invention affects how other factors such as firm size influence the incentives to innovate suppose the invention is a new process that lowers a variable cost of producing a good or service the value of the invention to a firm that adopts it is the increase in profit from using the new technology if the inventor cannot sell or license the new technology its value is the cost reduction for the output of goods or services affected by the new process if the firm is small perhaps because it is one of many firms in a competitive market its benefit from the new technology is correspondingly small on the other hand if the inventor can sell or license the new technology to others the total value that the inventor may collect is the sum of the cost reductions for all the potential adopters which for other adopters is independent of the own scale of the inventor can sell or license its new technology is usually though not necessarily determined by whether the invention is protected by an exclusive intellectual property right such as a patent a patent confers the right to exclude others from making using or selling the invention claimed by the patent for the term of the patent grant if the new technology is patented the inventor can license one or more firms to use the new technology in this way the patent allows the inventor to expand the universe of potential applications for the new technology and increase its protection does not guarantee that the inventor can prevent competition from others either legally by inventing around the new technology or illegally by infringing the patent several studies have shown that patents do not confer substantial protection in many industries see eg see levin et al cohen et al b and hall and ziedonis if patent protection is weak or the inventor may choose to keep the new technology a secret avoiding disclosure and thereby hoping to gain a lead before others can imitate her discovery in some cases a new discovery may require large complementary investments that raise barriers to entry for imitators and give the inventor at least some exclusivity licensing is not out of the question even if the invention does not have the protection of a patent sometimes the information required to employ a new is so specialized that it requires extensive teaching from the inventor or another experienced user that information can be shared with a license the risk of a license is that the licensee may choose to use the and renege on promised royalty payments after the licensee obtains the information required to use the new technology the licensor may be unable to recover damages if the licensee can use the to invent around the new technology or engage in misappropriation that is difficult for the licensor to detect or enforce however anton and yao show that even in the absence of patent or trade secret protection an inventor can discourage this type of misappropriation by threatening to license the to rival firms if the licensee reneges on the terms of the incentives with rights this section focuses on incentives for process innovations that are protected as trade secrets or with some other intellectual property right that does not prevent independent discovery of the new technology inventors often choose to protect process innovations as trade secrets because a patent discloses the invention and it is difficult to detect when someone infringes a process patent trade secret has more limited value for product innovations because the discovery is revealed when the product is sold the first to invent benefits only to the extent that keeping the invention a secret can provide a head start against rivals or if the inventor is so dominant in the industry that competition from rivals can be this case of intellectual property rights the presence of rival firms that can independently invent and adopt the new process technology reduces the value of discovery to each potential inventor with greater numbers of firms that compete in the supply of goods or services that benefit from a new technology it is likely though not necessary that each share of the total output using the new technology would fall and so would its corresponding benefit from invention a smaller share reduces the benefit from a process innovation because its value is proportional to the scale at which it is used thus with rights to a process technology and inventors competition can discourage investment in this result is consistent with the view expressed by joseph schumpeter that large firms and by extension concentrated industries have greater incentives to engage in because they are better able to capture its this risk could be avoided by requiring the licensee to pay for the in a requirement imposes a risk on the licensee however who has to pay for the new technology before knowing what it is see eg levin et al and cohen and klepper this is not a necessary result because competition lowers prices and increases total increase in total output can offset the reduction in the output of each firm see dasgupta and stiglitz a for a derivation of the effects under certain market expenditures can be redundant if an inventor cannot prevent another firm from independently investing to make the same discovery as would be the case with intellectual property rights competition in is economically inefficient if it merely duplicates an invention without introducing new features or enhancing the capabilities of firms to develop other new technologies it would be more efficient to have a single invention and encourage its use by others but incentives to invent would be small unless the inventor has a way to obtain compensation from others who use the intellectual property rights competition tends to reduce the incentive to invest in process because competition tends to limit the output of each firm holding other things such as the size of the market constant which in turn reduces the benefit from a new technology a complication is that the number of firms in a market equilibrium that will invest in is itself endogenous to the production technology and to the nature of competition in the industry suppose that the invention lowers a constant marginal production cost and that competition is so intense that only the firm with the lowest marginal cost survives in the suppose that if two or more firms make a process innovation then they have the same marginal cost and competition between them destroys any profit from the invention in this case if one firm has already developed the new technology no rational second firm would invest in a second inventor would earn no net revenue with the new technology and would suffer the costs of the first firm to invent therefore has effective exclusivity because no rational second firm would invest where competition is extremely intense the exclusivity assumption is not important because competition limits the number of firms that would engage in of course this argument presumes that firms invest rationally in and that they observe whether a firm has succeeded in before they incentives with exclusive some circumstances economic theory contradicts the schumpeterian argument that competition erodes incentives to invest in for a new process technology when the inventor has exclusive rights that guarantee perpetual protection from or not an inventor has exclusive rights to a new technology does not affect the incentives of a monopolist that is the only firm that can either invest in or use the new technology but exclusivity does affect incentives for competing the inventor gets exclusive rights to the invention arrow showed that a monopolist that is not exposed to actual or potential competition has less incentive to invest in than does a firm in a competitive industry exclusive intellectual property rights allow the inventor to capture the same benefits of the new technology whether it is a monopolist or one of many competing firms the inventor can choose to expand its production by using the new technology itself as a monopolist would or license others if the inventor and the monopolist have similar abilities to exploit the new technology they can earn similar benefits even if the inventor had technical capabilities it could extract value by licensing the new technology for use by others assuming that the inventor is not unduly constrained in the license fees that it may charge the potential benefit from the invention would be similar to the benefit that a monopolist could even if the competitive firm and the monopolist realize the same profits from an innovation the monopolist will realize a smaller net benefit a firm that has a monopoly position in a market has a flow of profit that it enjoys if no innovation takes place the monopolist can increase its profit by innovating however it loses or cannibalizes the profits from its old technology and benefits only by the increment to its profits tirole calls this the replacement effect a firm in a competitive industry by definition has no legacy flow of profits to cannibalize other than the normal return on investment for a competitive industry if the competitive firm can capture the same benefit from innovation as the monopolist its differential return is higher because it has no monopoly profits that are replaced by the innovation a stream of profits reduces its net payoff from innovation relative to a competitive arrow concludes that a monopolist has less incentive to invest in than a competitive results are instructive but are not sufficiently general to show that competition necessarily promotes for inventions that can be protected by noted above patents rarely provide an inventor with an exclusive ability to exploit her invention and other forms of intellectual property protection such as copyright and trade secret are typically weaker even with exclusive intellectual property rights theoretical results do not necessarily extend to product innovations which are significant both because they account for a large fraction of total expenditures and because new products spur economic growth and advance consumer welfare when firms compete by offering differentiated products even competitive firms can earn positive profits hence a competitive firm also can face a replacement effect that reduces its incentive to develop a new product although it is likely to be smaller than for a monopolist furthermore a new product changes the ability of a firm with a portfolio of products to discriminate among consumers and this can make innovation particularly attractive for a monopolist these factors imply that under some conditions a monopolist can benefit more from a product innovation than a license fees may be constrained because the licensor may be unable to perfectly monitor the output of the licensee or by antitrust laws that limit the types of contracts that the licensor can employ see gilbert and weinschel for a discussion of antitrust constraints on licensing the national science foundation estimated that in about percent of all industry directed to product innovations national science foundation the fraction varies for different technologies in a survey of information technology more than half of the respondents reported that new processes contributed most to their revenues national science foundation see eg greenstein and ramey describing a model of competition with vertical product differentiation for particular distributions of consumer preferences the ability to price discriminate using both products gives it a greater incentive to introduce the new investment incentives in monopoly and competitive markets are however similar for process and product innovations protected by exclusive and permanent rights when the innovations are innovations are drastic if existing products or processes do not constrain the price a drastic product innovation makes existing products obsolete with exclusive rights the payoff from a drastic innovation is the same for both monopoly and competitive firms but the replacement effect is lower for a competitive firm incumbent firms that are protected from product market and competition have lower incentives to invest in for new products or processes that are drastic innovations compared to firms in competitive markets this result helps to explain observation that dominant firms tend to introduce incremental improvements while drastic discoveries tend to come from new competitors or fringe investment in result that with exclusive intellectual property rights competition leads to more research and development than monopoly will not hold in all cases even for process innovations for example a monopolist that is already entrenched in a market may have incentives to invest in to preempt competitors analysis assumed that a monopolist faced no competition in either the product market or in research and development a firm may have an entrenched position in an existing product market resulting from for example large sunk assets strong brand recognition or large complementary investments that give rise to network economies but even an entrenched monopolist faces the risk that a new discovery will be introduced that will compete with its established product or a new process will confer a cost advantage on a competitor a monopolist has incentives to invent new products or processes itself thereby preempting potential rivals gilbert and newbery show this incentive to preempt may be stronger than replacement effect thus a monopolist can have a greater incentive to invent than a competitive firm provided that the monopolist can forestall competition by innovating the incentive to make the next discovery is the profit that it would lose if a competitor successfully enters the industry a incentive to invent is the profit it would earn if it successfully enters under some conditions the incentive to preserve its profit can exceed the profit incentive and the monopolist may invest heavily to preempt entry by being the first to patent a new implications of preemptive investment for consumer welfare are practice will extend the life of a monopoly but not indefinitely society is likely to benefit from faster introduction of new products in some cases a monopolist may take a sleeping patent that is it may patent a product but not introduce it to the market that product than a new competitor who sells only the new product similar results can be obtained with a model in which firms supply products that are horizontally differentiated meaning that consumers differ in their preferences for products sold at the same price see eg gilbert however is likely to be rare both because the inventor would forego the benefits of the new technology and because other innovators are likely to invent around the patent a firm may also engage in preemptive in a race to develop a new product the incentives for such preemption stem from the dynamics of innovation competition in a race to be the first to gain exclusive rights to a new product a firm that has a head start in the competition may be able to maintain its lead over rivals if any rival attempts to close the technology gap the leader may engage in preemptive to maintain its position knowing that their efforts will be futile rival firms that lag in the competition may drop out of the race entirely preemption can occur if the dynamics of competition provide a technological leader with an unassailable position in a race to patent a new technology in some circumstances a small lead in the innovation race can be enough to render competition ineffective and adding more competitors to the race may have little or no effect on the pace of innovation by the firm that occupies the technological results typically rest on several strong assumptions a firm can preempt competitors by investing in only if it can obtain rights to an invention that effectively foreclose alternative entry paths for competitors in most markets firms can take many paths to develop new technological alternatives and closing one path eg by winning a patent is not likely to erect an insurmountable obstacle to new competition a preemption strategy may not be profitable if the incumbent firm is not a monopolist vickers competition reduces the payoff to a preemption strategy because the benefits from preventing competition are shared with others for an effective preemption strategy a firm must be confident that it will win the competition if it invests more than its rivals or if it achieves a head start in an race as reinganum has shown uncertainty in the link between rival investments and their can undermine preemption incentives an incumbent firm has no incentive to preempt its rivals if there is a large enough probability that its efforts will fail furthermore the preemption result assumes that an entrant that wins a patent cannot bargain with the incumbent for exclusive rights to the new technology salant allows an innovator to obtain a share of the monopoly increases a expected profit from innovation and makes it more expensive for the incumbent to preempt entry these conditions that are necessary for successful preemption are restrictive and the preemption incentive is unlikely to dominate the replacement effect for most may spur innovation not only by leading to more but also by leading to more diverse parallel paths can contribute value to the extent that the paths are not redundant anecdotal evidence suggests that organizational factors limit the extent to which a firm can diversify its innovation efforts andrew grove the former ceo of intel described how he wanted to keep his options open by pursuing active see eg fudenberg et al and harris and vickers for microprocessors that utilized both risc reduced instruction set computing and cisc complex instruction set computing technology in the end intel abandoned risc in favor of cisc because it was too difficult to pursue both options simultaneously grove preservation of alternative paths was an important factor in the decision to challenge the proposed merger of lockheed and northrop lockheed and northrop compete to develop manufacture and sell a range of electronics systems and military aircraft to the us military although many of the markets in which lockheed and northrop compete are highly concentrated and have high barriers to entry according to rubinfeld and hoven the cornerstone of the challenge to the merger was concern that the acquisition would substantially lessen innovation in various products and services for defense focusing on the market for aircraft rubinfeld and hoven note that issue was not whether a consolidation from three aircraft manufacturers to two would reduce the intensity of innovative published literature does not yield a clear conclusion on that especially since a large share of spending is funded by the dod rather the issue was that the number of independent innovators would be reduced by one the doj director of operations and merger enforcement echoed the importance of innovation in the decision to challenge the merger and emphasized the need to maintain diversity in the core capabilities to develop and produce advanced military little is known about the effects of competition on innovation diversity it is not obvious that reducing the number of firms in an industry reduces the number of independent paths that follows if each firm takes a single path but some firms successfully pursue several research paths for example pharmaceutical research companies test hundreds and thousands of molecular combinations in search of new medicines some theoretical work suggests that competition can result in too much innovation diversity as firms attempt to differentiate their research activities in order to minimize us department of justice v lockheed martin and northrop grumman complaint court for the district of columbia march available at httpaddr daniel l rubinfeld and john hoven and antitrust january working paper rubinfeld was chief economist and hoven was staff economist at the the investigation of the proposed constance k robinson and other forms of innovation protecting the future for and emerging industries through merger speech before the american bar association chicago illinois june at httpaddr see eg henderson and cockburn larger pharmaceutical companies realize economies of scope by sustaining diverse portfolios of research projects that capture internal and external knowledge see eg dasgupta and maskin and farrell et al incentives for feature that is absent from the standard economic analysis is that people perform and people have whims and preferences that are often in conflict with the goal of sir john hicks observed that monopolies are slow to innovate when he said that best of all monopoly profits is a quiet hicks perhaps competition promotes not because innovation is more profitable in competitive markets but rather because competition disciplines firm managers in ways that promote innovative theoretical papers show that even with intellectual property rights competition can stimulate by forcing managers to innovate in order to reduce the risk of bankruptcy see eg schmidt and aghion et al if the risk of bankruptcy is low in monopolistic markets the need to innovate is also low and managers of monopoly firms can enjoy the quiet life however even these models do not provide a robust conclusion that competition promotes innovation managers could have a fascination with new technologies and invest too much in in this case the risk of bankruptcy which is greater in competitive markets would encourage managers to be more efficient by being less innovative the general result is that competition reduces the margin that managers enjoy to pursue their own objectives and this can move them in the direction of more or less the effects of competition on managerial performance also depend on whether firms are active in credit markets managers may have to act efficiently to avoid bankruptcy if their firms are saddled with debt because a high debt load even for a firm with market power squeezes the margin available to managers to pursue objectives that are inconsistent with empirical theory leaves significant gaps in our understanding of the effects of market structure on innovation and hence it is all the more important to turn to empirical although many studies test the hypothesis that market structure influences research and development most have serious deficiencies that greatly undermine their value early studies often failed to account for industry differences in technological opportunities and in the ability of firms to capture the value of their many studies examine the effects of market structure on spending but spending is an input to the innovation process not an output of innovation some studies attempt to measure the output of innovation by counting patents but patents are only weakly related to actual innovation performance this section offers a brief review of the vast empirical literature relating expenditures and innovation to market characteristics such as concentration competition and firm structure and federal trade commission line of business data for firms scott found no significant relationship between market structure and after controlling for effects that were specific to firms and their industries also using ftc line of business data levin et al show a statistically significant relationship between industry concentration and both intensity and the rate of introductions of innovations that peaked when the combined market share of the largest four firms in the industry was about fifty percent to sixty percent the authors then included variables to measure technological opportunity and appropriability for each firm these included for example the effectiveness of appropriation mechanisms such as secrecy lead time and ease of imitation inclusion of these variables dramatically lowered the significance of the concentration variables in the regression at the same time technological opportunity and appropriability were significant with the expected signs these econometric studies suggest that whatever relationship exists at a general level between industry structure and masked by differences across industries in technological opportunities demand and the appropriability of inventions all of which are important to the process of baldwin and scott note most common feature of the few and innovation analyses that have sought to control for the underlying technological environment is a dramatic reduction in the observed impact of the schumpeterian size and market power statistical studies do not allow a strong test of the relationship if any between competition and because it is extremely difficult to hold other factors constant that influence innovative activity an ideal test of the effect of competition on innovation would be a in which external and unforeseen events cause a discrete change in competition with no other consequence for other determinants of innovation such as technological opportunity or appropriability unfortunately there are no examples in the economics literature of a true natural experiment to study the effect of competition on innovation still some studies have gotten useful results by focusing on market events that are close to the appropriate in import policies which cause relatively rapid changes in market structure without changing technological opportunities are plausible albeit highly imperfect approximations of natural experiments significant increases in competition resulting from changes in import penetration or other industry shocks have triggered the major restructuring of some industries to achieve lower manufacturing costs and to develop new and more competitive products macdonald confirmed these observations by analyzing the determinants of the rate of growth of labor productivity output per hour of labor in industries during the period through he porter observes that competitive markets have more innovation but his conclusions are based on international comparisons that do not control for other possibly confounding see eg dertouzos describing the experience of xerox domestic steel and chemical producers and commercial airline manufacturers to increased that increases in import penetration had large positive impacts on labor productivity in highly concentrated industries using labor productivity as an imperfect indicator of technical change these results suggest that a sudden increase in competition had significant benefits for technical progress in markets that had been highly study by bresnahan reported on the consequences of an ftc consent decree that opened a market to new competition in the federal trade commission reached a consent decree with the xerox corporation that required xerox to offer licenses at prescribed royalties for all of its patents relating to plain paper copiers the ftc order generated a discrete change in the structure of the plain paper copier industry there was a sudden entry of new competitors who previously were foreclosed from competing in this industry because they did not have access to the xerox patent portfolio share of all plain paper copiers in use fell from percent in the early s to about percent by the mid s there was a great deal of innovative activity over this time period by both xerox and new entrants into the plain paper copier industry changes in technological opportunities in the decree time period such as the invention of the microprocessor make it difficult to draw a confident conclusion that the surge in innovation was a direct result of the increase in competition brought about by the consent decree instead bresnahan focused on the direction of innovation in the decree period bresnahan found that most firms entered market niches that were not close substitutes for their existing product example producers of coated paper copiers such as scm ab dick and royal moved into plain paper copiers even though they possessed marketing and distribution expertise that would have been particularly useful in the copier segment many of the new entrants into the copier segment were firms that had no prior experience in the copying industry such as savin and xerox continued to offer products for all market segments bresnahan concluded that had a choice chose to enter product segments where higher rates of inventive activity would destroy rents not their this behavior is consistent with innovation incentives that follow from the arrow replacement evidence concerning is little empirical evidence that established firms invest heavily in to preempt competitors even in the pharmaceutical industry where patents provide strong protection from imitation the patenting of a new drug need not prevent other firms from developing and patenting other drugs that have similar therapeutic effects cockburn and henderson lerner studied personal disk drives an industry characterized by a sequence of transforming found that the firms that were the market leaders in a particular generation of disk drive technology often failed to maintain their lead in the next generation dominant firms in this industry were not able to preempt future competition blundell et al find evidence that dominant firms tend to innovate more which is consistent with preemption but they also conclude that overall market concentration depresses innovation czarnitzki and kraft find empirical evidence for the proposition that dominant firms are more likely than smaller firms in an industry to acquire exclusive licenses for new technologies this is consistent with the preemption theory but it applies to a bidding market in which the prerequisites of the theory are likely to be evidence concerning firm size and intensity given differences in market sizes the relationship between market structure and firm size is far from perfect and firm size can have implications for investment that are distinct from market structure effects kamien and schwartz in their review of the early empirical literature concluded that activity measured by either input or output intensity appears to increase with firm size up to a point and then level off or a constant intensity implies that increases proportionally with firm size baldwin and scott summarizing many studies conclude that preponderance of evidence indicates that economies of scale in industrial of both the firm and the research establishment are in most cases exhausted well below the largest firm and research establishment size examined the studies that have found a pervasive positive relationship between size and intensity are those drawing on samples including companies of widely ranging sizes and with little or no control for industry effects the schumpeterian hypothesis relating innovation to firm size appears to hold up if interpreted as a threshold one but does not imply that giant corporations are essential for vigorous in most theory suggests that the effects of firm size and competition on innovation should differ for process and product innovations process innovations are more difficult to protect from imitation even if they are patented because infringement often cannot be detected for this reason intellectual property protection for process innovations has more of the characteristic of a intellectual property empirical studies of market structure and failed to distinguish product and process innovations which is a serious few empirical studies that have separately tracked research and development for new products and processes have identified effects that agree with the theoretical prediction that the return to investment in process increases with the scale of output that employs the process for example link and lunn found that returns to process increased with market concentration for process innovations while link and lunn looked at concentration because they did not control for firm size they may have found a firm size effect all else equal higher market concentration suggests greater recent studies find additional and sharper support for the theory cohen and klepper a find that business unit size explains most of the variance in process expenditures and that sales at the firm level have virtually no additional explanatory power this result is consistent with the theoretical argument that the value of a process innovation that is not licensed or sold to others should be proportional to the output of the activity to which it is applied this output is related to the size of the business unit in which the process is used not necessarily to the total size of the and klepper also find that the relationship between expenditure and business unit size is weaker in industries that experience high growth or where licensing of innovations is common these factors allow even a small firm to benefit from either by licensing the innovation to others or by applying the innovation to higher future output cohen and klepper b test the relationship between firm size and the propensity of firms to patent product and process innovations following scherer they assume that a patent covers a process innovation if it is employed in the same industry in which it originates the argument being that innovations that are kept are likely to relate to productive efficiency rather than to new products for sales to find that the fraction of patents that are classified as process innovations tends to increase with the size of the firm this is also consistent with the theory as larger operations allow a firm to benefit more from a process of empirical empirical observations have important implications for the schumpeterian hypothesis that large firms and market power promote schumpeter argued that a monopolist can more fully exploit economies of scale in and monopoly profits can cushion the uncertain payoff of furthermore most firms finance with internally generated funds so monopoly profits can translate into more dollars to spend on firms are likely to know more than investors about prospects investors would be reluctant to invest in risky projects if they believe that firms will use internally generated funds for projects that have high expected payoffs and will turn to the capital market only for projects that have low expected or unusually risky raises the possibility that monopoly is beneficial for simply because monopoly profits lower the cost of raising funds for however the finding that process proportional to business unit size but not firm size contradicts the argument that monopoly promotes innovation by providing a more stable platform to engage in is important to recognize that these empirical results relate to spending and not to the output of innovation the results suggest that at least for process innovations expenditures increase in proportion to firm size above some threshold level this implies that all else equal a merger would not increase the total level of spending in an industry however such a merger could increase the output of innovation and reduce the extent of redundant effort with intellectual property rights the investment in by each firm in a fragmented industry may be quite small corresponding to its relatively small output and the level of cost reduction for each firm achieved by that investment also would be small by increasing a output a merger could generate greater incentives for investment in process and a greater cost reduction for the industry thus these empirical results suggest that at least for some types of process innovations industry consolidation could benefit the output of innovation and be a partial efficiency defense to mergers that may otherwise raise concluding chapter surveys economic theory and empirical studies on the relation between horizontal market structure and incentives to invest in process and product incentive to invest in increases with the monopoly profits that a firm can protect by innovating and decreases with the profits that a firm can earn if it does not innovate innovation incentives differ for inventions that are protected by exclusive and intellectual property rights as property rights imply greater competition and lower profits from showed that for process innovations that reduce marginal production costs innovation incentives are lower for a monopoly that is protected from both product and competition than for a competitive firm provided that the innovator maintains exclusive and permanent rights to the innovation this result does not necessarily extend to product innovations a monopolist that is protected from both product and competition could have a greater incentive than a competitive firm to invest in product innovation relative investment incentives in monopoly and competitive markets are however similar for process and product innovations protected by exclusive and permanent rights when the innovations are drastic in the sense that they make existing products or processes for competition in can reverse theoretical result that given permanent and exclusive intellectual property rights incumbents who are protected from product market competition have lower incentives than competitive firms to introduce process innovations under some conditions a firm that is a dominant supplier of an existing product has an incentive to preempt rivals by investing more in than the rivals would gain from the innovation furthermore a firm that has a large head start in could have an incentive to maintain its lead over rivals and that incentive could be sufficient to deter innovation it is difficult to make general conclusions about incentives in different market structures the analysis does permit some broad characterizations and lessons for antitrust policy for intensive industries economic theory supports the proposition that competition is more likely to provide greater incentives for product and process innovations if the following conditions apply these conditions apply for investment in with and without exclusive rights to inventions although there is a stronger presumption that competition promotes investment in if the inventor gains exclusive in the old product is the extent that competition in the old product is intense this lowers the profit for a competitor that would be replaced by the new technology and increases its incentive to innovation is a major the new product is such a major improvement relative to existing products that it would make the existing product obsolete the lower replacement effect would give it a larger incentive to invest in for the new product even without exclusive intellectual property protection a competitor would have an incentive to invest in for a major improvement provided that it has a head start or some other protection from rapid innovation does not increase the ability of the monopolist to price discriminate among new product can be particularly valuable for a monopolist if it enables the firm to price discriminate among consumers by offering both its old and new such price discrimination is not likely the replacement effect suggests that a competitor would have a greater incentive to invest in a competitor and a monopolist would not have different abilities to price discriminate if the new product is a major improvement relative to the existing product and is protected by exclusive and effectively permanent intellectual property conditions make preemption preemption incentive requires strong conditions and is unlikely to be significant if the incumbent firm faces product market competition or if there are alternative paths that the incumbent firm cannot foreclose by patenting a new technology moreover a head start in is unlikely to preempt rivals if discovery is uncertain or if discovery does not foreclose alternative evidence for preemptive investment by dominant firms is empirical evidence on the relationship of competition and innovation is mixed several careful studies suggest that competition promotes innovation if inventors gain exclusive rights to their inventions a number of studies that focus on product innovations show that and competition are positively related the relationship between competition and process innovations is different because intellectual property protection is weaker for process innovations compared to product innovations most inventors choose trade secret rather than patents to protect process innovations because a patent would disclose the invention and infringement is difficult to detect and punish if a process innovation is not licensed it would apply to output the firm itself produces hence the larger the output the greater the incentives for investment in can reduce incentives for process innovation by reducing firm evidence suggests that investment in for process innovations is proportional to business unit size a result that is consistent with the have interpreted the result that investment in is proportional to business unit size to imply that mergers or other consolidations of business activity would have no significant effect on the total amount of industry holding the level of industry output constant will be the same with one large firm as with many small ones this conclusion ignores the crucial distinction between expenditure and the of innovation if the output of process innovation is proportional to the level of investment there would be larger cost reductions if one firm performs all the applies the resulting process improvements to the entire industry output thus the theory and the empirical evidence suggest a plausible efficiencies defense for mergers in industries where process innovation is particularly important of course a merger or industry consolidation could increase market power and result in higher prices and lower output possibly offsetting any positive efficiency consequences from greater incentives to invest in large body of economic theory and empirical studies on the relationship between competition and innovation fails to provide general support for the schumpeterian hypothesis that monopoly promotes either investment in or the output of innovation the theoretical and empirical evidence also does not support a strong conclusion that competition is uniformly a stimulus to innovation while specific industry characteristics and technological opportunities determine the equilibrium relationship between market structure and innovation there are conditions that warrant a presumption that competition promotes innovation under these conditions the theory and empirical evidence support the antitrust enforcement efforts to promote innovation by challenging mergers that would harm product market there are also circumstances for which it reasonable to assume that competition does not affect or possibly reduces innovation incentives while harm to innovation can be an additional reason to challenge mergers under some circumstances

http://www.innovationmanagement.se/2012/04/12/10-tips-for-successful-innovation-teams/ management innovation management tips successful innovation teams comments feed open access tipping how the groupthink tendencies can affect iframe search for about contact get im management creating value with innovation cases im channel the hard tips for successful innovation innovation projects are said to fail of the time why is this of the answer lies in the special innovation teams who are with finding breakthrough growth in large corporations setting teams up for success is vital yet corporations often fail when this this article provides a collection of ten tips that serve as talent management roadmap for growth companies in search teams that published april by carl fudge roca in after interviewing a series of successful growth leaders and management gurus we found that successful innovation teams by selecting a diverse group who are analytical and creative in measures and have networks that are as broad and as deep as their sets they function best within a structured environment that specialized working practices such as safe space and performance goals finally the best teams are fully committed invested in their success mimicking the intense focus displayed imagine that been asked to lead a new innovation team at company your task is to build a team that can come up with a business idea and take it all the way from to launch got a serious challenge on your hands though finding new growth beyond the core will be tough in a company that been making the same products for decades and has a notoriously averse culture on the plus side been given a budget and freedom to assemble your own dream team to help you on your mission the other hand you have a lot of time and your president is breathing down your neck looking for results where do start by building a bigger box rather than trying to think outside the first step in building the innovation team is selecting the people the best way to start is by understanding the actual work team will do and then optimizing the personnel around these activities commonly included in the work of an innovation team is creative phase to generate new business ideas an analytical phase understand their business potential and a development phase to the most promising ideas and then test them in the market with activities in mind assembling a group of people only capable thinking outside the box clearly be sufficient for success the generation of the idea is only one part of the process we that a better staffing goal is to bring together a team that has biggest box assembling a group of people only capable of thinking the box clearly be sufficient for success as the of the idea is only one part of the the box represents the sum of the experiences skills networks and academic knowledge that the team possesses the more diverse the backgrounds of the team are the bigger the they will have to draw from professor jeanne liedtka from university of darden school was among the first to make important distinction between these two concepts in her book catalyst and it applies as well to the innovation team as it does the growth leader which was her a big box is helpful for many reasons especially because it the likelihood of forming new cognitive connections between all of team members commonly known as the moments that spur great ideas and identify undiscovered possibilities a team with a larger will also be more capable of addressing the various challenges questions that come up along the course of a journey from generation to while we believe that selecting people capable of generating thinking is a given we are surprised at how often companies err on side of caution in this respect bringing in a group of veterans deep experience of the core business can prevent them from seeing possibilities while we advocate stocking the team full creatives who are wired to generate a bucket of crazy ideas be implemented it is unlikely that your team will come up anything too breakthrough without sufficient diversity and a big select your team for who they know as well as what they the old adage of not what you know but who you know is true innovation teams every innovation team needs members who with one glance at their rolodexes or iphones can answers and call in favors fast as management guru jon explains in an innovation team there is no way to divorce individual innovator from his network access to a strong provides insight into a broader range of knowledge but it provides support an innovation team that take advantage of networks will be less while innovation teams usually network fairly instinctively we that the quality of professional networks should be an selection criteria when staffing decisions are made in fact tools have allowed mapping networks to become a much easier task figure and it is a wise investment of time to investigate underrated aspect of teams before personnel selections are made importance of a strong network was highlighted recently during consulting project at a large consumer goods company when spread that the team needed to supply detailed internal rate of projections for an upcoming meeting with top executives team panicked not only was there little time left before the but they felt that they yet have the facts to put together a granular analysis on the other hand disappointing a senior group executives could be fatal for their luckily a member of the innovation team had a strong relationship the vp of finance for the division before the meeting he reached out to the vp and aligned on the level of analysis needed generating enthusiasm for the work thanks to the strong network particularly his relationship with the vp finance the new business concept gained vital from executive team they were granted more resources to continue the concept a big win for the figure click to pick one leader and provide him or her the autonomy they need to because so much has been written about the concept of leadership we instead chose to focus on how to set up the given for success in their role our research taught us several principles leadership that are unique to innovation first having just one appointed leader on the team is optimum some innovation teams have experimented with leadership duos or they have rarely succeeded one entrepreneur tim ogilvie who was of a leadership team at a software startup remarked innovation team that has more than one leader set up success he reasoned that the key downsides are and lower morale equal voting rights creates over decisions and grumpy partners a solo leader is free to own vision and make final decisions which helps him keep the moving along fast a vital trait in this kind of work for the of the innovation team continuing to press forward even with information is better than stalling progress while waiting for data interestingly we found that while having one appointed leader vital multiple members of the team can and should be able to step and take on leadership roles at times when they hold the expertise at that time katzenbach reports that a team who is able execute this practice has reached the status of a real team highest level of functionality by a group of the second major principle of team leadership is that the successful leaders are granted total autonomy over team selection are free to recruit the people they feel are needed on the hopefully with the assistance of a seasoned hr professional and make substitutions when changes are necessary being able to fire a team member is an important aspect of team success as teams need stay nimble and flexible with personnel who can respond to the of the project at any given build a team that can both identify gaps in the market and markets in we all know that a good business idea usually fills a gap in the the idea addresses some sort of unmet need for which there is other solution currently available that is an important start but enough to be considered true innovation innovation happens there is not only a good idea but also real customers willing to for it that is to say there is also a market in the surprisingly innovation teams often neglect to bring in the required to ensure both of these two things being able to assess the size of a market is often the part innovation teams find easier most large corporations and consulting firms have plenty of analytical whizzkids capable performing heavy lifting in excel and sizing the likely opportunities attainable for a new business concept often they estimations of financial performance sometimes referred as a reverse income statement that can either fuel further or be used as rationale for deprioritization while there is no of the value that financial analysts bring this unfortunately ensure that the idea is good to start with impossible to staff team full of analysts and expect them to come up with anything to generate creative ideas and identify gaps in the market nothing replace the original insights gleaned through a team member trained ethnography an role is to observe consumer and generate insights around their unmet needs needs that lead to ripe innovation having an ethnographer on the innovation team ensures that innovate in a ethnographers spend time observing and interviewing consumers as go about their daily activities looking for pain points understanding their motivations having an ethnographer on innovation team ensures that companies innovate in a vacuum consumers and their needs become a constant grounding force behind direction of the on a recent innovation project with a large financial services ethnographers noticed simultaneous yet conflicting unmet needs banks and their consumers while consumers desired more contact with banking tellers banks sought to reduce costs by down branches spotting this unmet need eventually led to the of a virtual teller system delivered via atms equipped with and video screens connected to outsourced tellers in remote this innovative idea was a for banks and their consumers the concept has been launched in the find team members who tell great in our experience the ability to communicate the new business idea almost as important as the quality of the idea itself whether you presenting to your boss your colleagues or to a panel of capitalists it is absolutely vital that they come away with a understanding of the value proposition and a enthusiasm to make it successful a good storyteller can help make a storytellers can describe problems and their solutions in a way captivates attention and encourages action they can help collaborate better and gain more support from others in organization in addition it is cognitively simpler and emotionally compelling for audiences to hear a versus sitting through a dull presentation of industry analysis financial projections stories can be told verbally but they often more impact if combined with visual methods such as cartoons and movies modern platforms such as facebook pinterest have all emerged as story telling vehicles highlight the potency of combining verbal and visual at entertainment and devices business unit the organization has spearheaded the use of visual methods and stories present new consumer experiences it has proven to be effective as a tool to communicate with the engineers who responsible for creating the technology that makes the new experiences a reality they see one of our presentations and they jazzed not only are they more enthusiastic they also make mistakes allowing us to innovate faster said one microsoft understand the difference between good and bad while we strongly believe that a diverse innovation team will the best results there is no doubt that bringing together such a variety of people who have different roles thinking preferences perspectives will lead to some interpersonal friction differences can lead to discomfort and even conflict so attention to the working processes is a vital responsibility the the inevitability of such conflict was aptly described by liedtka who summarized that the value of the team and its lives in the diversity of their perspectives but we also know accomplishing things in the face of very diverse perspectives difficult to in fact not only is some conflict inevitable but perhaps it is desirable katzenbach said people think you put teams because they are compatible well you sure want that on innovation team you certainly want team members to learn to together but you want compatibility because you want their to challenge each getting people who think very differently to work together ensures that the diversity can be harnessed instead of threatening take down the entire team group process skills understanding work gets done in a group can help and the team must sophisticated procedures rules group dynamics and interaction in order to do cheryl perkins former chief innovation officer at described the difference between good and bad conflict good or constructive conflict means maximizing debate and problem that relates to the work itself one form of constructive conflict when group members challenge each assumptions and hypotheses the hope of arriving at a better answer it is important to however that constructive conflict can be over done challenging another person is unlikely to lead to innovation in it can even be a source of bad conflict interpersonal conflict disagreements about the content of the work leak over into interpersonal realm bad conflict should be nipped in the bud constructive conflict should be supplement the innovation core team with an external sometimes no matter how great the innovation team it can help to in an outsider in our work had great success bringing external experts from outside our organization to function a knowledge resource that can inspire an organiazation to consider and audacious srategies in some cases teams lacking a spark consider hiring a wild card member who in the words of will come up with eight crazy ideas and two really good ones interpersonal idiosyncrasies that they might bring are more mitigated by their potential to come up with a gamechanging idea insight we like to refer to this role as that of the irritant is not to say that they must in fact be an irritating person that their personality and experiences are in such contrast to that the rest of the group that their mere presence can act as a boost at a recent ideation session with a large cpg company a senior of the organization showed up to play the role of the unlike the rest of his colleagues who came in standard business dress he wore a bright bow tie and jeans he spent much of the bouncing ideas of other colleagues while also reacting to and on the ideas of the group while his comments were imaginative relevant they were far from succinct and he seem bounded by agenda at the end of the session however the room was buzzing with handful of insights that this man had contributed to the group ability to think expansively his long history working with studying corporateinnovations and his confidence to think out while stumbling into the next great thought allowed him to significant remember to set goals and measure some innovation teams neglect to set goals at the start of a because the range of possible outcomes from the project are so that they find it impossible to know what to shoot for on the hand they want to aim too high as they want to fail but the same time they want to constrain themselves to considering incremental opportunities even though it might seem to a difficult exercise teams that have the discipline to set upfront are likely making a painting an image of the future that the whole team buys feeds the hunger for success while also mitigating starting off by establishing a vision of what the team is hoping achieve is the first step dr kobus neethling president of the african creativity foundation notes that painting an image of future that the whole team buys into feeds the hunger success while also mitigating conflict when team members confident they are all striving for the same goal conflict is lessened because the only things they can disagree will be how to achieve those the high performing teams tend to revisit their goals periodically a way of reinforcing amongst themselves their commitment to the according to katzenbach the metrics that work the best are ones the team has themselves as teams are more likely to committed and accountable to goals that they have set for while some teams might set themselves lofty goals such as find of new revenues we believe that focusing on business outcomes early in the process is a mistake we agree with recommendation in the catalyst that getting an answer to a might be a better goal to set innovation requires a number of experiments aimed at figuring out which new idea will work and getting an yes this will work or no this will one measure of success disconfirming data is not to considered a failure because cutting bait on bad ideas before you money and time are vital for long term success of any that aims to think like a startup after spending time with successful entrepreneurs we were struck the stories they told about the high levels of motivation and they displayed at their peak this level of commitment and is hard to mimic in a large corporation where members of teams often work under less pressure in fact often surprised to see members of corporate innovation teams going their work in a business as usual manner in stark contrast to approach of startup entrepreneurs whose passion often drives them work long hours and make other personal sacrifices for the good of business much of the innovation taking place in world happening because of entrepreneurs and if big corporations are going keep up mindsets and behaviors among innovation teams will need attempting to spur entrepreneurial motivation within a might be possible by adjusting the compensation and rewards to more risk and more potential for financial rewards if this is feasible perhaps team members could at least sign an contract pledging their commitment to the ensure team members have both feet regardless of the potential monetary or other rewards there is doubt that for any innovation team to be successful team members be fully committed and not one foot in one foot out when looking this aspect of motivation it is helpful to put on the hat of a capitalist to understand what characteristics are most important them when they evaluate an innovation according to carter griffin from technology vc firm updata successful innovators have a unique mindset the mentality is one they have to put their entire being behind this initiative as ones who try to hedge fail the ones who pour their soul into typically make one recipient of venture funding from updata partners was a marketing company called icontact the ceo of the company ryan started the company while a student at the university of north at chapel hill after a short while his young tech company growing and performing smartly soon ryan was faced with a decision continue at unc and finish his degree or leave to focus his startup for him it was a just like his role

defense congress has authorized darpa to cash prizes to further mission to sponsor research that bridges the gap between discoveries and military use darpa has technologies needed to the first fully autonomous ground vehicles capable of completing substantial course within a limited time the third event darpa urban challenge which took place on november and broadcast via webcast further advanced vehicle requirements include autonomous operation in a mock urban history and grand grand urban related see external press history and see also history of driverless fully autonomous vehicles have been an international pursuit for years from endeavors in japan starting in germany dickmanns and vamp italy the argo project the european eureka prometheus project the united states of america other

the course required more elevation gain and some very sharp daggett ridge were required near the beginning of the route course had far fewer curves and generally wider roads than the a vehicle that was developed for the darpa urban the natural rivalry between the teams from stanford carnegie mellon sebastian thrun head of the stanford team previously a faculty member at carnegie mellon and colleague of whittaker head of the cmu team was played out during the mechanical problems plagued before it was passed by gray entry was a miracle in itself as the team from the of new orleans was

vehicles the robots operated in isolation and only other vehicles on the course when attempting to pass the challenge required designers to build vehicles able to obey all laws while they detect and avoid other robots on the course this is particular challenge for vehicle software as vehicles must intelligent decisions in real time based on the actions of vehicles other than previous autonomous vehicle efforts that on structured situations such as highway driving with interaction between the vehicles this competition operated in a cluttered urban environment and required the cars to sophisticated interactions with each other such as precedence at a way stop urban challenge teams employed a variety of different software hardware combinations for interpreting sensor data planning

http://www.cockeyed.com/inside/million/million.html million how much is inside a million dollars it is a round number that gets thrown around all the time in commercials annual reports and blackmail notes but hardly knows what that kind of money really looks like would it all fit in paper bag a backpack a shipping the first step in showing how much is inside was withdraw one dollars from my bank account i quickly realized that the nigerians had not yet deposited my payoff so i had to settle for a one hundred dollars came in a tidy packet with a cute blue paper if you ever meet someone with a bunch of these paper bands in glove compartment please show them my the largest us bill in circulation is the dollar bill and it takes of those to make one million ten thousand bills that is the smallest size you can get a dollars in the first step in simulating a million dollars is to take a close at genuine money all bills from the us federal reserve are the size so i carefully measured and weighed my bankroll this serve as a guide for my massive counterfeit intent on getting bills of paper i visited office circus bought six sheet reams of real bills are wide tall and one of them is exactly one centimeter each sheet of paper when cut would yield four next i visited copies where they have industrial machine i asked them to cut the of paper into they asked about my and when they found out about my counterfeiting plans they reminded that i would not be able to pay for the cutting service with disappointed but understanding i paid with a fake i came away from with paper bills in a cardboard i made a hundred paper piles on couch each centimeter represented after separating the paper i designed and printed paper bands for my counterfeit cash the bank teller had told me hundreds are wrapped with purple bands she asked me about intentions and when she found out about my counterfeiting plans reminded me that i would not be able to deposit fake soon my pile of fake bills were done and wrapped hundred packets of a hundred the pile filled cubic inches x x and was about size of a television it weighed almost pounds immediately i began living the life of a there was champagne cigars caviar cocaine rio tivo ritz limousines ink cartridges lobster yacht races gold cards diamond watches diamond pendants diamond tennis bracelets diamonds pyramid schemes chewing tobacco helicopters penthouse suites real estate gated communities gilded art auctions marble statues bribes baccarat intrigue lasers fashion shows awards shows broadway oh wait there any chewing tobacco ok maybe just a but it was damn fine chewing my reign of magnificence was cut short by a phone call some tibetan rebels had taken mark hostage and demanding a million dollars ransom they warned me not to call the luckily i had charged all my recent purchases on black american express card and could use the pile of fake cash to ransom i just had to warn them not to call the us stacy was the first to point out how cumbersome all that money was carry i needed some kind of case to carry it in it all in my neon green a beach fanny i assumed i would need to buy a chic looking but they were pretty pricey i considered asking the kidnappers leave a small deposit for the case but i want to deal with steve suggested a gallon paint this is perfect keep it in the back of your truck he i liked this idea but kidnap negotiations can a certain level of confidence i needed to find some good luggage would fit all this brooke and i made our way to arden fair mall in sacramento stores are always devoid of customers so i figured i would get immediately sure enough they had a nice bag that could about million in i want to look like a doctor so i kept searching i wanted briefcase but a regular briefcase can only hold about at luggage in downtown plaza we the silvery cases i had been imagining debbie and donald the salespeople were happy to assist one the zero halliburton premiere silver case all the moneyexactly one million dollars debbie donald brooke i took turns lugging it around the being burdened with a million dollars in cash is a nice sensation was pretty heavy illustrating the need for sturdy briefcase returning home we were pleased to have an answering machine from mark he had been safely located in xixabangma after his buddhist before blowing the money on supplies for the welcome home party took one more measurement the stack of bills was inches one the party was great but it ended up being the fake money had been refused at almost every liquor store

once a year by the royal swedish academy of sciences it one of the five nobel prizes established by the will of nobel in and awarded since the others are the prize in chemistry nobel prize in literature nobel prize and nobel prize in physiology or medicine the first prize in physics was awarded to wilhelm conrad a in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by discovery of the remarkable rays or this award administered by the nobel foundation and widely regarded as most prestigious award that a scientist can receive in physics is presented in stockholm at an annual ceremony on december anniversary of nomination and award see external alfred nobel requested in his last will and testament that money be used to create a series of prizes for those who confer greatest benefit on mankind in physics chemistry physiology or medicine and literature nobel wrote several wills during his lifetime the last was written little over a year before he died and signed at the club in paris on november nobel of his total assets million swedish kronor million in to establish and endow the five nobel due to the level of skepticism surrounding the will it was not april that it was approved by the storting the the executors of his will were sohlman and rudolf lilljequist who formed the nobel foundation to care of fortune and organise the the members of the norwegian nobel committee who were to award peace prize were appointed shortly after the will was approved organisations followed the karolinska institutet june the swedish academy on june and the royal swedish academy sciences on june the nobel foundation then an agreement on guidelines for how the nobel prize should be in the nobel newly created statutes were by king oscar ii according to will the royal swedish academy of sciences were to award the prize nomination and main article list of nobel laureates in a maximum of three nobel laureates and two different works may selected for the nobel prize in physics compared with other nobel prizes the nomination and selection process for the in physics is long and rigorous this is a key reason it has grown importance over the years to become the most important prize three nobel laureates in physics front row from left albert michelson albert einstein and robert a the nobel laureates are selected by the nobel committee physics a nobel committee that consists of five members elected the royal swedish academy of sciences in the first stage thousand people are asked to nominate candidates these names scrutinized and discussed by experts until the choice is forms are sent to about three thousand individuals to invite them submit nominations the names of the nominees are never announced and neither are they told that they have been considered the prize nomination records are sealed for fifty years in some nominees do become known it is also common for publicists to such a claim founded or the nominations are screened by committee and a list is produced approximately two hundred preliminary candidates this list forwarded to selected experts in the field they narrow it down approximately fifteen names the committee submits a report recommendations to the appropriate while posthumous nominations are not permitted awards can be made the individual died in the months between the decision of the committee typically in october and the ceremony in december prior posthumous awards were permitted if the recipient had died being the rules for the nobel prize in physics require that the of achievements being recognized has been tested by time in it means that the lag between the discovery and the award is on the order of years and can be much longer for example half the nobel prize in physics was awarded to chandrasekhar for his work on stellar structure and evolution that done during the s as a downside of this approach not scientists live long enough for their work to be recognized important scientific discoveries are never considered for a prize the discoverers may have died by the time the impact of their work a physics nobel prize laureate earns a gold medal a diploma bearing citation

wish is not to the world but to change the world oh all laughter cool i mean technology business do change the world not always in a good way they do what about art could art change the i started when i was years old and at that time i was thinking about changing the world i was doing graffiti writing my name everywhere using the city as a canvas was going in the tunnels of paris on the rooftops with my each trip was an excursion was an adventure it was leaving our mark on society to say i was here on the top of so when i found a cheap camera on the subway i documenting those adventures with my friends and gave them back photocopies really small photos just that size at years old i started pasting them and i did my expo de rue which means sidewalk gallery and i framed with color so you would not confuse it with advertising mean the the best gallery i could imagine i would have to make a book and then present it to a gallery and let decide if my work was nice enough to show it to people i control it directly with the public in the so paris i would change depending on the i would go the title of the exhibition on i was quite proud of that one because i just and i was just up there on the top of the then when the photo left the frame was still november the streets are burning a large wave riots had broken into the first projects of paris was glued to the tv watching disturbing frightening taken from the edge of the neighborhood i mean these without control throwing molotov cocktails attacking cops and the firemen looting everything they could in the these were criminals crooks dangerous pursuing their and then i saw it could it be possible my photo on wall revealed by a burning car a pasting done a earlier an illegal one still there i mean these the faces of my friends i know those guys all of them not angels but not monsters either so it was of weird to see those images and those eyes stare back at through a so i went back there with a mm lens it was the one i had at that time but with that lens you have to be close as inches from the person so you can do it only their trust so i took four portraits of people from le they were making scary faces to play the caricature themselves and then i pasted huge posters everywhere in bourgeois area of paris with the name age even building of these guys a year later the exhibition displayed in front of the city hall of paris and we go from images been stolen and distorted by the media now proudly taking over his own image where i the power of paper and glue so could art change the a year later i was listening to all the noise about middle east conflict i mean at that time trust me were only referring to the israeli and palestinian conflict with my friend marco we decided to go there and see who the real palestinians and who are the real israelis are they different when we got there we just went in the started talking with people everywhere and we realized things were a bit different from the rhetoric we heard in media so we decided to take portraits of palestinians israelis doing the same jobs lawyer asked them to make a face as a sign of commitment not smile that really tell about who you are and what feel they all accepted to be pasted next to the i decided to paste in eight israeli and palestinian and on both sides of the wall we launched the illegal art exhibition ever we called the project face the experts said no way the people will not the army will shoot you and hamas will kidnap you we okay try and push as far as we can i love the way people will ask me how big will my photo be it will as big as your house when we did the wall we did palestinian side so we arrived with just our ladders and realized that they were not high enough and so palestinians say calm down no wait going to find you a so he went to the church of nativity and brought back an ladder that was so old that it could have seen jesus being laughter we did face face with only six friends ladders two brushes a rented car a camera and square feet of paper we had all sorts of help from all of okay for example palestine in ramallah now pasting portraits so both portraits in streets in a crowded market people come around us and asking what are you doing here oh actually an art project and we are placing an israeli and a doing the same job and those ones are actually two and then there was always a silence you mean an israeli face doing a face right here well yeah part of the project and i would always leave moment and we would ask them so can you tell me who who and most of them we even pasted on israeli military towers and happened when you paste an image just paper and people can tear it tag on it or even pee on it some a bit high for that i agree but the people in the they are the curator the rain and the wind will take off anyway they are not meant to stay but exactly years after the photos most of them are still there face face demonstrated that what we thought impossible was possible and you know what even easy we push the we just showed that they were further than anyone in the middle east i experienced my work in places many museums so this direction in the street were kind interesting so i decided to go further in this direction go in places where there were zero museums when you go in developing societies women are the pillars of their but the men are still the ones holding the streets so were inspired to create a project where men will pay tribute women by posting their photos i called that project are heroes when i listened to all the stories everywhere went on the continents i always understand complicated circumstances of their conflict i just sometimes there was no words no sentence just tears just took their pictures and pasted women are heroes took me around the world most of the i went to i decided to go there because heard about through the media so for example in june i watching tv in paris and then i heard about this terrible that happened in rio de janeiro the first favela of named providencia three kids that was three students were detained by the army because they were not their papers and the army took them and instead of them to the police station they brought them to an enemy where they get chopped into pieces i was shocked brazil was shocked i heard it was one of the most favelas because the largest drug cartel controls it so decided to go when i arrived i mean i have any contact with ngo there was none in place no tourist agent no ngos no eyewitnesses so we just walked around and we a woman and i showed her my book and she said you what hungry for culture we need culture out so i went out and i started with the kids i just took a photos of the kids and the next day i came with the posters we pasted them the day after i came back and they were scratched but okay i wanted them to feel that art belongs to then the next day i held a meeting on the main square some women came they were all linked to the three kids that killed there was the mother the grandmother the best friend they all wanted to shout the story after that everyone in the favela gave me the green light i took photos and we started the project the drug lords were kind worried about us filming in the place so i told them know what not interested in filming the violence and weapons you see that enough in the media what i want show is the incredible life and actually been seeing around me the last few days so a really symbolic because the first one we did that you see from city and where the three kids got arrested the grandmother of one of them and on that where the traffickers always stand and a of exchange of fire everyone there understood the and then we pasted everywhere the whole what was interesting is that the media get in mean you should see that they would have to film us from really long distance by helicopter and then have a really lens and we would see ourselves on tv pasting and would put a number please call this number if you know going on in providencia we just did a project and then so the media know so how can we know about project so they had to go and find the women and get explanation from them so you create a bridge between the and the anonymous we kept traveling we went to africa sudan sierra liberia kenya in places like monrovia come straight to you i mean they want to know what up they kept asking me what is the purpose of your are you an ngo are you the media art just doing some people question why is it in black and white you have color in france laughter or they tell you these people all dead some who understood the project explain it to others and to a man who did not understand i someone say you know been here for a few trying to understand discussing with your fellows that time you thought about what going to tomorrow this is art i think that motivates them to come into the projects and it becomes more it becomes a desire a need an armor this bridge in monrovia an soldier helped pasting a portrait of a woman that might have been raped the war women are always the first ones targeted this is kibera kenya one of the largest slums of you might have seen images about the that happened there in this time we covered the of the houses but we use paper because paper prevent the rain from leaking inside the house vinyl then art becomes useful so the people kept it you what i love is for example when you see the biggest eye there are so many houses inside and i went there a months ago photos are still there and it was missing a of the eye so i asked the people what happened oh guy just moved laughter when the roofs were covered woman said as a joke now god can see me when you look kibera now they look okay india before i start that just so you know time we go to a place we have a tourist agent so we set like commandos a group of friends who arrive and we try to paste on the walls but there are places you just paste on a wall in india it was just impossible paste i heard culturally and because of the law they just arrest us at the first pasting so we decided to paste white on the walls so imagine white guys pasting papers so people would come to us and ask us hey what you up to oh you know just doing art art course they were confused but you know how india has a lot dust in the streets and the more dust you would have up in the air on the white paper you can almost see there is this sticky part like when you reverse a sticker the more dust you have the more it will reveal the photo so could just walk in the street during the next days and the would get revealed by themselves applause thank so we get caught this each project a film from women are music okay for each project we do a and most of what you see a trailer from women heroes its images photography taken one after other and the photo kept traveling even without laughter applause hopefully see the and understand the scope of the project and what people felt when they saw those photos because a big of it layers behind each photo behind each image is women are heroes created a new dynamic in each of communities and the women kept that dynamic after we for example we did books not for sale that all community would get but to get it they would have to get signed by one of the women we did that in most of the we go back regularly and so in providencia for example the favela we have a controlled center running there kibera each year we cover more roofs because of course when left the people who were just at the edge of the project hey what about my roof so we decided to come the year and keep doing the a really important point for me is that i use any or corporate sponsors so i have no responsibility to but myself and the subjects applause and that is me one of the more important things in the work i today as important as the result is the way you do and that has always been a certain part of the work interesting is that fine line that i have with images advertising we just did some pasting in los angeles another project in the last weeks and i was even invited to the moca museum but yesterday the city called them and look going to have to tear it down because this be taken for advertising and because of the law it has be taken down but tell me advertising for the people i photograph were proud to participate in project and to have their photo in the community but asked me for a promise basically they asked me please make story travel with you so i did paris in each place we built exhibitions with a story and the traveled you understand the full scope of the london new york and today they are with you long all right recently i started a public art project where use my artwork anymore i use man ray helen giacomelli other artwork it matter if your photo or not the importance is what you do the images the statement it makes where pasted so example i pasted the photo of the minaret in switzerland few weeks after they voted the law forbidding minarets in the applause this image of three men wearing gas masks taken in chernobyl originally and i pasted it in southern where the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the in some ways art can change the world art is not to change the world to change practical things but change perceptions art can change the way we see the art can create an analogy actually the fact that art change things makes it a neutral place for exchanges discussions and then enables you to change the world when do my work i have two kinds of reactions people say why you go in iraq or afghanistan they would be useful or how can we help i presume that you belong the second category and good because for project going to ask you to take the photos and so now my wish is mock drum roll laughter wish for you to stand up for what you care about participating in a global art project and together turn world inside out and this starts right now yes everyone the room everyone watching i wanted that wish actually start now so a subject passionate about a who you want to tell their story or even your own photos tell me what you stand for take the photos the upload it give you all the details and you back your poster join by groups and reveal things to world the full data is on the website insideoutprojectnet that is launching what we see changes who we are when we act the whole thing is much more than the sum of the parts so hope that together create something that the world remember and this starts right now and depends on thank thank you can share this video by copying

over pulitzer ap wins pulitzer prize for series on new york city spying on subscribe today to the click here for your free days the christian science weekly digital no pulitzer prize winner was announced on monday for either fiction editorial writing despite a jury naming three finalists in we are always sorry when people are disappointed says gissler administrator of the pulitzer prizes i always like to that giving an award is like sprinkling fairy dust on the quiz how well do you know the pulitzer prize for fiction the lack of a prizewinner in fiction a popular category has gotten lot of attention but mr gissler says it is not a statement fiction in general just a statement about the the three finalists in a category are selected by a jury which sends the works to the person pulitzer prize board the meets over two days to choose the winners as was the case this if a work fails to get the majority of the vote no award given not all board members can vote the number of voting varies but is about this year the fiction jury read books before on the finalists the finalists were train dreams a novella by johnson swamplandia by karen russell and the pale king david foster wallace which was published there is speculation that the books were choices than years the pale king was unfinished when mr wallace died and his pieced together much of the book from his manuscripts after his some parts are clearly finished but as a whole it feel finished says sam maclaughlin a bookseller at mcnally jackson in new york city but one or two of the set pieces are some of best writing i have read all still says mr maclaughlin a prize would have been a worthwhile understandable gesture towards david foster mr train dreams was made into a collection after appeared in the paris review and swamplandia while a novel lacked some of the epic sweep that has characterized winners the last award went to jennifer egan for a visit from the this year there were multiple factors for not awarding a says gissler who declined to discuss the reasons in still many were disappointed that a winner was not selected from we nominated three novels we believe to be more than david foster the pale king karen swamplandia denis train dreams that the board declined to award prize to any of these superb novels is inexplicable jury maureen corrigan a book critic for fresh air georgetown university critic in residence told the english department the lack of a winner who receives is not as rare as sounds an award has not been given times across all categories the year fiction has not been chosen times since when the began prior to this year the editorial writing category had produced a winner nine times most recently in editorial is the most common news category not to receive an last year for the first time in the history of the pulitzer prizes award was given in the breaking news category in there was award for drama and in no award was given for feature the pulitzer prize for fiction typically helps book sales which especially valuable to the struggling book maybe this will lead to a sale boost for all three but i doubt maclaughlin book sales driving

http://askmagazine.nasa.gov/pdf/pdf30/NASA_APPEL_ASK_30i_x_teams.pdf ask magazine for deborah ancona and henrik more and more companies in hypercompetitive business environment success depends on the ability to innovate and put innovations to productive and profitable use for those for government agencies nonprofits school systems and other organizations facing their own innovation question is how do you actually create an infrastructure of do you establish the conditions that produce breakthrough just once but again and magazine of research ours and show that the real action takes industry juggernaut had fallen off track the former cell place at the team level this realization is not new the hard phone industry trailblazer was lagging behind more nimble part is to put in place teams that emerge as reliable engines of scandinavian companies like ericsson and nokia and even innovation how do you actually do it we offer one eminently korean players like samsung and lg the problem was that practical answer many of its historically successful peers motorola had grown into a giant and had become as yankee group analyst especially in large complex organizations the most jackson put it stodgy midwestern important the critical work of generating company that was meanwhile the competition had new products and done in teams that will not become exponentially smarter and more aggressive change anytime looked most of our thinking about what makes a team came the razr team razr was a team on a focused on internal dynamics for instance on how team it would develop a cooler and sleeker phone than anything the members interact how they structure their work how they world had seen cool and sleek was nothing new but this team resolve their to produce a phone that would surpass anything some of the most provocative research on team performance had come before a veritable of a phone adding to the indicates clearly that a team can work well the technical challenge the team faced a competitive climate in and still not deliver results in other words in the real world which a multitude of teams often as and internet all the challenge of bucking industry trends was matched is an and what makes it special what the team was up against at motorola itself as other teams numerous research studies comparing high and had discovered razr found that the great ideas vision sales teams product development teams and and engineering brilliance was not enough somehow the team consulting teams in the computer software pharmaceutical had to find a way to get the resources it needed to push through and financial services us to develop the a big unorthodox and expensive project in a large orthodox model of organization the answer the team engaged combines and integrates high levels of external three core external activities scouting ambassadorship and activity with extreme execution inside the team hence the name task most teams engage in some degree of external activity an external activity takes the form of scouting view such activity as central to their mission their new ideas opportunities and resources this might and their modus operandi is a top priority conducting a survey hiring a consultant interviewing customers from the day the team comes together like other project team spending a day the competition or just having members members of an are selected because they have coffee with an old college professor the razr team faced real the necessary content expertise process skills personality and technical challenges a complex design required complicated motivation to work together the but they are also technological footwork team members started by looking at chosen for their ties to other individuals and groups that can help what other teams had done before them they looked not only the team achieve its goals whether inside or outside the company at what had worked and what had not worked but also at what external behaviors are illustrated by the razr team had been discarded the team solved a number of technological at motorola by the late nineties motorola the communications challenges like mounting a camera on a tiny phone ask to make success team members for their networks as well as skil s and compatibility with external outreach a mind set and modus day end result the razr design became the tools such as checklists to help teams focus in the world with its killer margins the product was credited external activities as well as the internal turning around motorola at a crucial time unrelated to the razr project prevented the company milestones and deliverables to keep teams diffusing practices into its exploration exploitation and blend high levels of external activity with with top management to get their commitment inside they follow guidelines for work as a partner to help establish a context to the collaborative culture a transparent x teams and open information necessary to make full use of outside ideas and resources and they keep the work moving external and internal activities go a keypad that was etched directly onto the phone by concurrently with changing emphases through a series of repackaging existing technologies sometimes flexible phases that shift with the work requirements an other teams furthermore scouting the market initially explores the environment to figure out what convinced them that simple functionality and cool design very customers want what the competition is doing what top different from the smartphones of many competitors was a management will support and where resources can be that was waiting to be going outside from the very beginning the team critical external activity is ambassadorship meeting the critical importance of an external focus and innovation with management to gain support sponsorship and protection begins by bringing new eyes to a problem for example when from potential internal opponents to acquire funding and an ideo design team was redesigning an emergency room they other resources and to keep the work tightly connected put a camera on a head for ten hours after watching to the strategic imperatives the razr team engaged ten hours of ceiling they realized that their design would need in ambassadorial activity by finding a match between its to expand to the idea and top desire to shift on the results of its initial exploration and image they also worked with top management to somewhat greater emphasis on internal activities the team then air for the team and its program so it could moves quickly to prototype test and modify an innovative bureaucratic procedures eliminate political interference and new product or service that will exploit the most promising move quickly through product for example when a team at microsoft working externally involves task coordination to create new software for the internet generation they tested engaging with other individuals and groups inside and outside multiple prototypes with potential customers and redesigned the company to get feedback identify critical resources and multiple times based on their feedback they worked quickly convince or cajole others to help get the task done razr had to to get other parts of microsoft to help them in the in task coordination finding a home in the system of finally the team shifts operating mode again this time to manufacturing and marketing set up for very different kinds export the innovation to the larger organization for of phones was not an easy feat nevertheless by working with implementation the same microsoft team spent a great deal of other teams figuring out the interdependencies and making time getting others at microsoft messenger excited about their some compromises while refusing others razr pulled it magazine critical external activity is with management to gain support protection from potential internal acquire funding and other resources and to keep the tightly connected to the strategic an moves through these cycles of activity its factor is ensuring that team efforts are celebrated and that all the members move across the core operational and hard work is put to good tiers changing roles as needed the team also periodically in how to build teams that lead innovate adds and subtracts members as new linkage expertise and succeed harvard business school press we detail is needed this exchangeable with such how have driven innovation at companies as diverse activities as scouting ambassadorship and task as microsoft bp merrill lynch vale

defiance ohio on commentary by actress julianne commentary by director jane still httpaddr based on the true story of evelyn ryan the prize winner of ohio is one of those overlooked gems that deserves a long life on splendidly adapted by jane anderson from the by terry ryan one of daughters the film operates on endearing levels as a revealing study of the plight the eisenhower era an inspiring tale of tenacity and survival formidable odds and a charming family drama that tempers nostalgia with the emotional toll of harsh reality as always moore brings subtle perfection to her role as evelyn the mother of ten who compensates for the failings of alcoholic husband woody harrelson by becoming the most contester in the country entering poems and slogans in corporate sponsored contests throughout the and early winning everything from palm trees and sports cars and cash she holds the financially desperate together with happy smiles and a defiance of her volatile temper directing her first feature after a respected in television anderson employs some delightful visual effects to up the period kitsch in some cases allowing moore as narrator actor to appear with herself in the same scene but she compromises the emotional core of the drama which yields unexpectedly powerful payoff when surviving members of the ryan family appear as themselves in the touching final like evelyn this a winner out of out of write a customer most helpful customer of people found the following review out of stars one of julianne best performances by b add me to the list of fans who think the wonderful julianne deserved an oscar nod for this film this is a fairly adaptation of terry memoir both my wife and i have read enjoyed the book ms moore portrays evelyn ryan a strong intelligent housewife of the and mother of ten who uses writing talents to win contests literally keeping her family and the wolf from the door as presented in the book her timing winning prizes of cash cars and appliances was uncannily timely harrelson does a fine job too portraying her alcoholic and husband kelly laura dern appears also in a small role as contesting friend dortha and the supporting cast of kids are too especially the young actress who portrays daughter tuff grew to be the author of the i have only minor quibbles with film first i found the effect of ms moore talking the audience with her own character in the same scene a little i would have thought having tuff as the narrator would have been better though conventional choice and as expected some are taken with the book for instance in the scene where kelly ends with a bowl of jello mold all over him i believe it was accidental the book while in the film quite intentional while one understand rage her character would have never wasted that way otherwise though the film does a good job in depicting plight in those days from financial her husband being sole signer of the house they purchased with her cash prize domestic abuse the attitude that she just had to put up with abusive alcoholic husband even the implication by a priest that was her ms moore as usual is luminous in the role and the whole film above the level of an average drama than some occasional profanity from mr ryan a comment was this review helpful to of people found the following review out of stars an overlooked gem march by tara i loved this movie which get near enough mention on the best lists it is a delightful mixture of sweetness and harsh and does a wonderful job of showing the and at its best at its worst evelyn the mother despite the limitations imposed her society and her religion fights back valiantly using all talent and brains she has been gifted with both to win contests and mother her family the movie uses a number of little gimmicks could be overly cute but because it hesitate to the pain either the movie vividly portrays the plight of the beset by alcoholism when it was a shameful secret that of rarely ended up being a secret but instead of crying or using resulting anger to poison her family or passively allowing destructive forces of addiction to work its will evelyn what she can to save her family both emotionally and julianne moore does a splendid job of portraying a woman who could be pollyanna but instead shows greater strength than if she tossed drunken bum out and went outside the home to work bravo to her and the real evelyn ryan and to those who appreciate this great comment was this review helpful to of people found the following review out of stars julianne moore is a must see in prize february by jan if i ruled the world this list of oscar nominations for picture of would include the prize winner of defiance ohio winner is based on terry tuff memoir prize winner of defiance ohio how my mother raised kids on words or less an haunted house movie in which monsters are bankers milkmen priests and policemen while is a tenacious catholic this could have been grim stuff but filmmaker jane anderson who emmy and wga awards in for the positively true adventures of alleged texas mom and received emmy wga dga nominations in for normal takes her lead from tuff triumphant tone as her own as evelyn ryan julianne gives a performance of incredible depth and nuance smiling on outside screaming on the inside woody harrelson also succeeds giving husband kelly ryan a soul making it clear that kelly is as much a victim of societal expectations as evelyn i frankly know why this film do better at box office i predict it will be very popular when it hits the dvd shelves on th it will of course be categorized as a chick flick and men will therefore be loath to see it a shame because ryan was as uniquely american as truman capote edward r morrow her other male contemporaries and even though she herself in girdles and dowdy dresses the heroic dimensions of a well lived are clear for all to comment was this review helpful to see all customer write a customer most recent

henry dunant the of the international committee of the the nobel physics prize shortlist cited wilhelm discovery of and philipp work cathode rays the academy of sciences selected for prize in the last decades of the th many chemists had made significant contributions thus with chemistry prize the academy was chiefly faced with merely the order in which these scientists should be awarded prize the academy received nominations eleven of for jacobus hoff hoff was awarded the for his contributions in the swedish academy chose the poet sully prudhomme for the nobel prize in literature a group including swedish artists and literary critics protested against this decision expected leo tolstoy to win some including feldman have criticised this prize because they consider prudhomme mediocre poet explanation is that most of the members preferred victorian literature and thus selected victorian poet the first physiology or medicine prize to the german physiologist and microbiologist emil von during the s von behring developed an antitoxin to diphtheria which until then was causing thousands of deaths world war in and adolf third reich forbade laureates from germany richard kuhn adolf friedrich butenandt and gerhard domagk from accepting prizes each man was later able to receive the diploma medal even though sweden was officially neutral during war ii the prizes were awarded irregularly in the peace was not awarded no prize was awarded in any category from to the occupation of norway by germany in the subsequent all prizes were awarded except those for literature during the occupation of norway three members of the norwegian committee fled into exile the remaining members escaped from the nazis when the nobel foundation stated that the building in oslo was swedish

having developed and dynamic models for the analysis of processes although not a nobel prize it intimately identified with the other awards the laureates announced with the nobel prize recipients and the prize in sciences is presented at the swedish nobel prize ceremony the board of the nobel foundation decided after this addition it would allow no further new award the award process is similar for all of the nobel prizes the difference is in who can make nominations for each of announcement nobelprize chemistry submit play the announcement of the laureates in nobel prize in chemistry gunnar permanent secretary of the royal swedish academy announcement nobelprize literature submit play nobel prize in literature announcement by peter englund swedish english and nomination forms are sent by the nobel committee to about individuals usually in september the year before the prizes awarded these individuals are often academics working in a area for the peace prize inquiries are sent to governments of international courts professors and rectors former prize laureates and current or former members of the norwegian committee the deadline for the return of the nomination forms is january of the year of the award the committee nominates about potential laureates from these forms additional names the nominees are not publicly named are they told that they are being considered for the prize nomination records for a prize are sealed for years from awarding of the the nobel committee then prepares a report reflecting the advice experts in the relevant fields this along with the list preliminary candidates is submitted to the institutions the institutions meet to choose the laureate laureates in each field by a majority vote their decision cannot be appealed is announced immediately after the a maximum of three laureates and two different works may be per award except for the peace prize which can be awarded institutions the awards can only be given to individuals the peace prize is not awarded the money is split among the prizes this has happened times so posthumous although posthumous nominations are not permitted individuals who in the months between their nomination and the decision of the committee were originally eligible to receive the prize this occurred twice the literature prize awarded to erik karlfeldt and the peace prize awarded to un general dag since laureates must be alive at the time of the october announcement there has been laureate william vickrey who in died after the prize economics was announced but before it could presented on october the laureates for nobel prize in physiology or medicine were announced however committee was not aware that one of the laureates ralph steinman had died three days earlier the committee was debating prize since the rule is that the prize is not posthumously the committee later decided that as the to award steinman the prize was made in good faith it would recognition time will provides for prizes to be awarded in recognition discoveries made during the preceding early on the usually recognised recent discoveries however some of early discoveries were later discredited for example fibiger was awarded the prize for physiology or medicine his purported discovery of a parasite that caused cancer avoid this embarrassment the awards increasingly recognised discoveries that had withstood the test time according to ralf former chairman of the nobel prize committee for physiology medicine the criterion previous is interpreted by nobel assembly as the year when the full impact of the discovery become a room with pictures on the walls in the middle of the room is a wooden table with chairs around the committee room of the norwegian nobel the interval between the award and the accomplishment it varies from discipline to discipline the literature prize is awarded to recognise a cumulative lifetime body of work rather than single achievement the peace prize can also awarded for a lifetime body of work for example laureate ahtisaari was awarded for his work to resolve conflicts however they can also be awarded specific recent events for instance kofi annan awarded the peace prize just four years after becoming of the united nations yasser arafat yitzhak rabin and shimon peres the award about a year after they successfully concluded oslo although will stated that prizes should be awarded contributions made during the preceding year awards for chemistry and medicine are typically awarded once the achievement been widely accepted sometimes this takes decades for subrahmanyan chandrasekhar shared the physics prize for s work on stellar structure and evolution all scientists live long enough for their work to be recognised discoveries can never be considered for a prize if their impact realised after the discoverers have award two men standing on a stage the man to the left is clapping hands and looking towards the other man the second man is

normally a of why they received the prize none of the nobel peace prize has ever had a citation on their award the laureates are given a sum of money when they receive their in the form of a document confirming the amount awarded amount of prize money depends upon how much money the nobel can award each year the purse has increased since the s when prize money was sek c million sek eur in the monetary award was million million in june it lowered to million sek if there are two laureates in particular category the award grant is divided equally between recipients if there are three the awarding committee has the of dividing the grant equally or awarding to one and to each of the it is not uncommon for recipients to donate prize money to scientific cultural or humanitarian controversies and main article nobel prize controversial among other criticisms the nobel committees have been accused having a political agenda and of omitting more deserving they have also been accused of eurocentrism especially for literature when it was announced that henry kissinger was to be awarded peace prize two of the norwegian nobel committee members resigned peace among the most criticised nobel peace prizes was the one awarded henry kissinger and declined the prize this led to two norwegian committee members resigning kissinger and were awarded the for negotiating a ceasefire between north vietnam and the states in january however when the award was announced sides were still engaging in hostilities many critics of the opinion that kissinger was not a but the responsible for widening the yasser arafat shimon peres and yitzhak rabin the peace prize in for their efforts in making peace israel and palestine however many issues as the plight of palestinian refugees had not been addressed on negotiations and no final status agreement reached immediately after the award was announced one the five norwegian nobel committee members denounced arafat as terrorist and resigned additional misgivings about were widely expressed in various another controversial peace prize was that awarded to barack in nominations had closed only eleven days obama took office as president but the actual evaluation occurred the next eight months obama himself stated that he did feel deserving of the award or worthy of company it would place him in past peace prize were divided some saying that obama deserved the award and saying he had not yet earned it award along with the peace prizes for jimmy carter and al gore also accusations of a literature the award of the literature prize to elfriede jelinek drew protest from a member of the swedish academy knut ahnlund resigned alleging that the selection of jelinek had irreparable damage to all progressive forces it has also confused general view of literature as an art he alleged that were a mass of text shovelled together without structure the literature prize herta also generated criticism according to washington post many us literary critics and professors had previously heard of her this made many feel that the were too science in the portuguese neurologist egas moniz the physiology or medicine prize for his development of prefrontal leucotomy the previous year dr walter had developed a version of the procedure which was faster easier to carry out due in part to the publicity surrounding original procedure procedure was prescribed without consideration or regard for modern medical ethics endorsed such influential publications as the new england journal medicine leucotomy or lobotomy became so popular that about lobotomies were performed in the united states in the three immediately following receipt of overlooked the norwegian nobel committee declined to award a prize in year of death on the grounds that there was no living james joyce one of the controversial omissions of the literature the norwegian nobel committee confirmed that mahatma gandhi nominated for the peace prize in and a few days before was assassinated in january later members of norwegian nobel committee expressed regret that he was not given prize geir lundestad secretary of norwegian committee in said the greatest omission in our year is undoubtedly that mahatma gandhi never received the nobel prize gandhi could do without the nobel peace prize whether committee can do without gandhi is the in the year of death the nobel committee declined to award prize on the grounds that there was no suitable living candidate year later when the dalai lama was the peace prize in the chairman of the committee said that was in part a tribute to the memory of mahatma other high profile individuals with widely recognised contributions peace have been missed out foreign policy lists roosevelt havel ken sari and corazon aquino as people who never won the prize but the literature prize also has controversial omissions adam has suggested that many notable writers have missed out on the for political or reasons the heavy focus on and swedish authors has been a subject criticism the eurocentric nature of the was acknowledged by peter englund the permanent secretary the swedish academy as a problem with the award and was attributed the tendency for the academy to relate more to authors notable writers that have been overlooked for literature prize include leo tolstoy anton zola jorge luis borges marcel proust pound james joyce august strindberg simon john updike arthur miller chinua achebe and the strict rule against awarding a prize to more than three people also controversial when a prize is awarded to recognize achievement by a team of more than three collaborators one or will miss out for example in the prize was awarded koichi tanaka and john fenn for the development of spectrometry in protein chemistry an award that did not the achievements of franz hillenkamp and michael karas of institute for physical and theoretical chemistry at the of frankfurt similarly the prohibition posthumous awards fails to recognise achievements by an individual collaborator who dies before the prize is awarded in francis crick james d watson and maurice wilkins awarded the physiology or medicine prize for discovering the of dna rosalind franklin a key contributor in discovery died of ovarian cancer four years lise meitner a physicist who nuclear fission with otto hahn and his assistant fritz strassmann was also the to whom due to having to flee germany the nazis came to power her role in the research was not understood until years later when the team was awarded the enrico

the nobel prizes physics should be given to the person who shall have made the important or within the field of nobel did not emphasise discoveries but they have historically held in higher respect by the nobel prize committee than of the physics prizes have been given to discoveries compared only to inventions christoph bartneck and matthias rauterberg papers published in nature and technoetic

overlooked gems that deserves a long life on splendidly adapted by jane anderson from the by terry ryan one of daughters the film operates on endearing levels as a revealing study of the plight the eisenhower era an inspiring tale of tenacity and survival formidable odds and a charming family drama that tempers nostalgia with the emotional toll of harsh reality as always moore brings subtle perfection to her role as evelyn the mother of ten who compensates for the failings of alcoholic husband woody harrelson by becoming the most contester in the country entering poems and slogans in corporate sponsored contests throughout the and early winning everything from palm trees and sports cars and cash she holds the financially desperate together with happy smiles and a defiance of her volatile temper directing her first feature after a respected in television anderson employs some delightful visual effects to up the period kitsch in some cases allowing moore as narrator actor to appear with herself in the same scene but she compromises the emotional core of the drama which yields unexpectedly powerful payoff when surviving members of the ryan family appear as themselves in the touching final like evelyn this a winner out of out of write a customer most helpful customer of people found the following review out of stars one of julianne best performances by b add me to the list of fans who think the wonderful julianne deserved an oscar nod for this film this is a fairly adaptation of terry memoir both my wife and i have read enjoyed the book ms moore portrays evelyn ryan a strong intelligent housewife of the and mother of ten who uses writing talents to win contests literally keeping her family and the wolf from the door as presented in the book her timing winning prizes of cash cars and appliances was uncannily timely harrelson does a fine job too portraying her alcoholic and husband kelly laura dern appears also in a small role as contesting friend dortha and the supporting cast of kids are too especially the young actress who portrays daughter tuff grew to be the author of the i have only minor quibbles with film first i found the effect of ms moore talking the audience with her own character in the same scene a little i would have thought having tuff as the narrator would have been better though conventional choice and as expected some are taken with the book for instance in the scene where kelly ends with a bowl of jello mold all over him i believe it was accidental the book while in the film quite intentional while one understand rage her character would have never wasted that way otherwise though the film does a good job in depicting plight in those days from financial her husband being sole signer of the house they purchased with her cash prize domestic abuse the attitude that she just had to put up with abusive alcoholic husband even the implication by a priest that was her ms moore as usual is luminous in the role and the whole film above the level of an average drama than some occasional profanity from mr ryan a comment was this review helpful to of people found the following review out of stars an overlooked gem march by tara i loved this movie which get near enough mention on the best lists it is a delightful mixture of sweetness and harsh and does a wonderful job of showing the and at its best at its worst evelyn the mother despite the limitations imposed her society and her religion fights back valiantly using all talent and brains she has been gifted with both to win contests and mother her family the movie uses a number of little gimmicks could be overly cute but because it hesitate to the pain either the movie vividly portrays the plight of the beset by alcoholism when it was a shameful secret that of rarely ended up being a secret but instead of crying or using resulting anger to poison her family or passively allowing destructive forces of addiction to work its will evelyn what she can to save her family both emotionally and julianne moore does a splendid job of portraying a woman who could be pollyanna but instead shows greater strength than if she tossed drunken bum out and went outside the home to work bravo to her and the real evelyn ryan and to those who appreciate this great comment was this review helpful to of people found the following review out of stars julianne moore is a must see in prize february by jan if i ruled the world this list of oscar nominations for picture of would include the prize winner of defiance ohio winner is based on terry tuff memoir prize winner of defiance ohio how my mother raised kids on words or less an haunted house movie in which monsters are bankers milkmen priests and policemen while is a tenacious catholic this could have been grim stuff but filmmaker jane anderson who emmy and wga awards in for the positively true adventures of alleged texas mom and received emmy wga dga nominations in for normal takes her lead from tuff triumphant tone as her own as evelyn ryan julianne gives a performance of incredible depth and nuance smiling on outside screaming on the inside woody harrelson also succeeds giving husband kelly ryan a soul making it clear that kelly is as much a victim of societal expectations as evelyn i frankly know why this film do better at box office i predict it will be very popular when it hits the dvd shelves on th it will of course be categorized as a chick flick and men will therefore be loath to see it a shame because ryan was as uniquely american as truman capote edward r morrow her other male contemporaries and even though she herself in girdles and dowdy dresses the heroic dimensions of a well lived are clear for all to comment was this review helpful to see all customer write

http://askmagazine.nasa.gov/pdf/pdf30/NASA_APPEL_ASK_30i_x_teams.pdf ask magazine for deborah ancona and henrik more and more companies in hypercompetitive business environment success depends on the ability to innovate and put innovations to productive and profitable use for those for government agencies nonprofits school systems and other organizations facing their own innovation question is how do you actually create an infrastructure of do you establish the conditions that produce breakthrough just once but again and magazine of research ours and show that the real action takes industry juggernaut had fallen off track the former cell place at the team level this realization is not new the hard phone industry trailblazer was lagging behind more nimble part is to put in place teams that emerge as reliable engines of scandinavian companies like ericsson and nokia and even innovation how do you actually do it we offer one eminently korean players like samsung and lg the problem was that practical answer many of its historically successful peers motorola had grown into a giant and had become as yankee group analyst especially in large complex organizations the most jackson put it stodgy midwestern important the critical work of generating company that was meanwhile the competition had new products and done in teams that will not become exponentially smarter and more aggressive change anytime looked most of our thinking about what makes a team came the razr team razr was a team on a focused on internal dynamics for instance on how team it would develop a cooler and sleeker phone than anything the members interact how they structure their work how they world had seen cool and sleek was nothing new but this team resolve their to produce a phone that would surpass anything some of the most provocative research on team performance had come before a veritable of a phone adding to the indicates clearly that a team can work well the technical challenge the team faced a competitive climate in and still not deliver results in other words in the real world which a multitude of teams often as and internet all the challenge of bucking industry trends was matched is an and what makes it special what the team was up against at motorola itself as other teams numerous research studies comparing high and had discovered razr found that the great ideas vision sales teams product development teams and and engineering brilliance was not enough somehow the team consulting teams in the computer software pharmaceutical had to find a way to get the resources it needed to push through and financial services us to develop the a big unorthodox and expensive project in a large orthodox model of organization the answer the team engaged combines and integrates high levels of external three core external activities scouting ambassadorship and activity with extreme execution inside the team hence the name task most teams engage in some degree of external activity an external activity takes the form of scouting view such activity as central to their mission their new ideas opportunities and resources this might and their modus operandi is a top priority conducting a survey hiring a consultant interviewing customers from the day the team comes together like other project team spending a day the competition or just having members members of an are selected because they have coffee with an old college professor the razr team faced real the necessary content expertise process skills personality and technical challenges a complex design required complicated motivation to work together the but they are also technological footwork team members started by looking at chosen for their ties to other individuals and groups that can help what other teams had done before them they looked not only the team achieve its goals whether inside or outside the company at what had worked and what had not worked but also at what external behaviors are illustrated by the razr team had been discarded the team solved a number of technological at motorola by the late nineties motorola the communications challenges like mounting a camera on a tiny phone ask to make success team members for their networks as well as skil s and compatibility with external outreach a mind set and modus day end result the razr design became the tools such as checklists to help teams focus in the world with its killer margins the product was credited external activities as well as the internal turning around motorola at a crucial time unrelated to the razr project prevented the company milestones and deliverables to keep teams diffusing practices into its exploration exploitation and blend high levels of external activity with with top management to get their commitment inside they follow guidelines for work as a partner to help establish a context to the collaborative culture a transparent x teams and open information necessary to make full use of outside ideas and resources and they keep the work moving external and internal activities go a keypad that was etched directly onto the phone by concurrently with changing emphases through a series of repackaging existing technologies sometimes flexible phases that shift with the work requirements an other teams furthermore scouting the market initially explores the environment to figure out what convinced them that simple functionality and cool design very customers want what the competition is doing what top different from the smartphones of many competitors was a management will support and where resources can be that was waiting to be going outside from the very beginning the team critical external activity is ambassadorship meeting the critical importance of an external focus and innovation with management to gain support sponsorship and protection begins by bringing new eyes to a problem for example when from potential internal opponents to acquire funding and an ideo design team was redesigning an emergency room they other resources and to keep the work tightly connected put a camera on a head for ten hours after watching to the strategic imperatives the razr team engaged ten hours of ceiling they realized that their design would need in ambassadorial activity by finding a match between its to expand to the idea and top desire to shift on the results of its initial exploration and image they also worked with top management to somewhat greater emphasis on internal activities the team then air for the team and its program so it could moves quickly to prototype test and modify an innovative bureaucratic procedures eliminate political interference and new product or service that will exploit the most promising move quickly through product for example when a team at microsoft working externally involves task coordination to create new software for the internet generation they tested engaging with other individuals and groups inside and outside multiple prototypes with potential customers and redesigned the company to get feedback identify critical resources and multiple times based on their feedback they worked quickly convince or cajole others to help get the task done razr had to to get other parts of microsoft to help them in the in task coordination finding a home in the system of finally the team shifts operating mode again this time to manufacturing and marketing set up for very different kinds export the innovation to the larger organization for of phones was not an easy feat nevertheless by working with implementation the same microsoft team spent a great deal of other teams figuring out the interdependencies and making time getting others at microsoft messenger excited about their some compromises while refusing others razr pulled it magazine critical external activity is with management to gain support protection from potential internal acquire funding and other resources and to keep the tightly connected to the strategic an moves through these cycles of activity its factor is ensuring that team efforts are celebrated and that all the members move across the core operational and hard
