http://www.arimaa.com/arimaa/challenge/2012 the arimaa humans win screening period mar to mar challenge match apr to apr human tarou asou jean daligault eric momsen with omar syed as computer screening challenge the challenge the first person company or organization develops a program which can defeat the top human arimaa players an official arimaa challenge match before the year will win arimaa challenge prize the prize is currently usd official challenge match will be between the current best and three selected human challenge details the arimaa challenge match will consist of games using the time control each of the players will play a three game series against the program program must demonstrate that it can win at least two of the games against each of the human players to win the challenge program can select which color to play in the first game and remaining games will be played with alternating color all games played according to the arimaa match rules the games will played over the internet in the arimaa gameroom and will be by the public while they are in progress the best program will running on the same computer system as that used in the championship games it will be run under the control of the coordinator with guidance from the match director the director send a representative to be present with the human player during games the director may also use a webcam to monitor the player during the games a representative from the best program also be present with the human player the human player may use aid such as a physical game board or a computer program so pieces can be moved to assist in planning a move no aid may be which suggests a move or provides any information about the aside from the position score defined in the arimaa match rules human player must be isolated from discussions of the game while game is in session between games the human players may study past games the best program may not be manually altered during between the challenge games also it cannot be manually between the computer championship games and the start of challenge match if requested the program can be allowed to run between the games so that it can study the past games and itself as long as this is an automated challenge schedule no more than one game will be played per day any one player the three players will alternate so that one has not played two or more games than another the program team notify the tournament director what color they wish to play in first game before start of the match the selected players must submit their schedule to the tournament director before the start the match the exact schedule specifying the dates times and player for each game will be determined and posted shortly the match hardware and os the hardware and os that will be used in arimaa challenge will be the same as that used in the championship the hardware will typically be a standard purpose computer that can be purchased within usd the os for the arimaa challenge will be a version of the linux selection of the best program the two programs which finished and second in the world computer championship will in a preliminary for the right to play in the arimaa match the two programs will be made available online for humans play against for a duration of at least two weeks and not more four weeks this is referred to as the screening period any player that wants to play against the programs must play programs equally in terms of number of times and color a player must not play more than two times against either program no more than one time with the same color thus if a human plays program a as gold the player must then play program b gold the program which has a better record after the period will go on to play in the challenge match in case of a the program which won the computer championship will go on to in the challenge match the games will be played using time the human players that will be playing in the challenge match not play against the programs during this time also developers the two programs may not play the programs during this time match director may disqualify the games of any player if it that a game was intentionally lost in order to distort selection of the human players omar and aamir syed will three human players that will play in the challenge match the best program the players will be chosen from among the rated arimaa players a first and second backup player will also chosen so that if any of the main players is not able to play any the games the backup players can substitute the name of the players and backup players will be submitted to the match before the start of the computer championship the names of players will be announced publicly after the computer tournament is intent of the challenge the main intent of the arimaa challenge to promote research in ai which can help to advance the field potentially have applications in other areas some areas of ai would be involved depending on the approach taken include recognition machine learning neural networks algorithms and expert systems it is hoped that in the processes achieving the arimaa challenge some new techniques are developed one or more of these areas that can also be applied to problems the arimaa challenge is designed to be met if progress is made in software and not from the advances in which are almost guaranteed as such the challenge will define hardware and os to be used and participants need only to develop advancing the state of the art as mentioned above the intent of arimaa challenge is to help advance research in areas of ai it is recommended that the participants especially those programs in the computer tournament submit articles to the technical journal describing their research and results if program wins the arimaa challenge it must be described in a submitted to the icga technical journal after winning the in order to receive any technical problems technical failures on httpaddr challenge match games will be remediated as once a player has started the next game of the series results of previous games in the series be no matter what issue is if it is determined during a game that either bot or human has suffered a disadvantage the game will be immediately made unrated and resumed from the point at which the first occurred the game must be halted regardless of whether disadvantaged player is winning or if it is determined after a game is over but before the next of the series that either bot or human player suffered a disadvantage the game result will be invalidated game will be made unrated and the game will be replayed from point at which the disadvantage first occurred the game must replayed whether the disadvantaged player won or disadvantages that warrant a game being halted include but are not limited extraneous processes running on the the game server failing to receive a move sent by a bot human either bot or human player not receiving a move sent by game a bot being restarted by the tournament a bot being misconfigured by the tournament the tournament director decides whether technical failures not this list warrant halting replaying when restarting games from a specific position the coordinator will attempt to restore the clock state reserve and game time as closely as possible to the state at the time issue the match coordinator will carry out the match in compliance the stated rules and does not make any decisions that will the course of the match in special situations the coordinator will follow the decision of the match the role of the match director will be to oversee that the challenge match is being conducted according to the stated and to serve as the arbitrator in case of disputes should

ghz p with gb ram gb free remark you can download the zipped version enwik here please find more details including constraints relaxations at httpaddr this compression contest is motivated by the fact that being to compress well is closely related to acting intelligently reducing the slippery concept of intelligence to hard file numbers in order to compress data one has to find regularities them which is intrinsically difficult many researchers live analyzing data and finding compact so compressors beating current dumb compressors need to be since the prize to stimulate developing universally

in the answers to the faq the paq compressors are hard to there are lots of language pieces in the including the decompressor size encourages why do you use the mb enwik and not gb or all why are you limiting validation to less than hours systems with less than gb the total prize is not exactly is mb byte or why do you require windows or linux how can i produce or smaller is artificial general

httpaddr httpaddr farzad mostashari md scm serves as national coordinator for information technology within the office of the national for health information documentation of the typical ophthalmology examination in an health record ehr continues to be challenging this creates to full acceptance and use of ehrs within the medical ophthalmologists frequently perform studies ancillary measurement and imaging devices outputs from these include graphical displays of measurement data eg visual testing numerical data eg autorefraction biometry and data eg retinal photography optical coherence however these data and images are often stored on the devices in proprietary databases and file formats and therefore limited connectivity with ehr systems and picture archiving and communication systems there are digital imaging and communication in medicine standards for all ophthalmology devices but adoption rate continues to be relatively and many existing legacy devices do not comply with these standards a result there are often problems with redundant entry of and clinical data into devices data transfer from devices to ehrs pacs without proprietary interfaces workflow challenges difficulty connecting systems from different these same challenges occur in a plurality of other medical that employ testing and measurement given this there is every expectation that the success of this challenge will immediately translatable to practices that use imaging and devices such as otorhinolaryngology ear nose and throat physical medicine and rehabilitation and cardiology among strong performance in the breadth of input devices and the neutrality judging criteria will facilitate this challenge is a multidisciplinary call to innovators and developers to create an application that improves among ophthalmic imaging devices measurement devices ehrs the application will achieve the convert output from legacy ophthalmic imaging and devices from proprietary formats to standard eg using freeware dicom archive data from multiple imaging and measurement display images and data for clinicians and permit functionalities such as optimizing viewing parameters brightness contrast color zoom integrate with existing ehrs eg single where applicable leverage and extend nwhin standards and including but not limited to transport direct web content transitions of care and the onc review panel will make selections based upon the breadth of input devices and the solution will accept output from a wide range of devices and input formats and convert to standard dicom eg using freeware usability and interface for image the solution will have an interface for clinicians a range of experience and comfort level with the solution will provide the ability to view and ophthalmic

challenge eligibility for a prize award contingent upon fulfilling all requirements set forth challenge submission the challenge submission period begins on july at eastern daylight time edt and ends on october at eastern standard time how to enter and submission submission there are two basic steps for create an interesting data visualization piece and summary select a topic that addresses the goal areas of safety economic development and create an interesting data product that demonstrates support to decision makers for topic the data visualization product should clearly display insight in support of a given policy or investment topic relevant data and build your data visualization develop a of your data visualization product that explains your topic data visualization improves understanding of your topic and conclusions the data visualization helps make the summary not exceed submit your entry register and log on httpaddr to submit your an entry into the challenge consists of your data visualization and accompanying summary to the us dot together the all entry materials must be in english all information must be provided for your entry to be submissions may be updated by the submitter until the submission period submission using data sets including those provided by the us dot create a visualization product that addresses critical transportation policy investment questions related to transportation safety or improving safety throughout the transportation network is the goal of the department of transportation safety measures include of deaths and many factors may influence these rates for in people were killed on our roadways at a of fatalities per million vehicle miles traveled in the number of people killed fell to at a rate of per million vehicle miles traveled in there are theories to explain the source of the improvement including effects of the economic downturn manufacturers creating vehicles success of safety campaigns such as those against driving and distracted driving higher rates of seatbelt use engineering improvements to roads and a sample visualization topic could be to examine through visualization the impacts of one or more of the above sources improving the safety measure of rates of fatalities per vehicle miles traveled between and the data visualization topic could also focus on local issues example drawing from local data sources how have improvements on intersection corridor or bus route helped to improve safety if improvements have yet to be made can the safety incident data presented in a way that points to what countermeasures can be taken improve possible data the national highway traffic safety fatality analysis reporting system fars httpaddr us census database httpaddr state and local department of transportation data talk to local other data sources as you see reduction in reduction in economic the competition for transportation development dollars is fierce is important for decision makers to know that their decisions will lead to positive outcomes for desired targets be safety security or economic the impact of transportation delays on economic growth has been documented in april a new rule went into effect aimed at the practice of airlines holding passengers on the tarmac for periods while awaiting gates or runways since that rule went effect the number of incidents of excessive tarmac time has a possible side effect of the rule has been an increase in cancellations resulting in individuals potentially being an investment example of possible unintended consequences of is the case where a new runway added at a runway airport may anticipated to add percent to the overall airport capacity but to added operational complexity a lower level of capacity is there is a broad range of aviation data available for application data visualization in addition to the above examples sample could explore the relationship between airline performance airport capacity utilization across the country this can examine by time of day what is the relationship between individual flight delays passenger delay due to late arrivals and missed what is the effect of weather and the seasons on airline examine the impact of changes to airline capacity air fares prices theuseconomy and the overall financial performance the airline industry over the possible data the bureau of transportation airline httpaddr faa data the us bureau of economic economics account httpaddr other data sources as you see submission challenge submissions will be scored in each of four criteria listed creativity and aesthetics of data like artwork data visualization products should be designed to the attention of the reader through creative use of visuals and animations if how original and attractive is data visualization success in translating multiple data sets into relevant at the core of data visualization is its potential to multiple large datasets to deliver relevant and actionable to the reader in a visually compelling way how well does the visualization product accomplish relevance to the goal areas of better understanding policy investment problems related to transportation safety or does the submission contribute to a potential policy investment issue in transportation safety or economic demonstrated value in assisting decision does the information presented in the data visualization product summary shed new light on a transportation issue that otherwise not have been the data visualization product submissions will judged by a panel of bts stakeholders selected by the us dot at its discretion the panel will judge the entire submission visualization product and summary text on the judging identified above in order to select the awardees judges have the to withdraw without

prize on september this forum now pages grand grand prize awarded to team pragmatic from netflix registered posts prize awarded to team pragmatic it is our great honor to announce the grand prize winner of netflix prize contest as team pragmatic chaos for verified submission on july at utc achieving winning rmse of on the test subset this represents a improvement over score on the test subset at the start the contest we congratulate the team of bob bell martin michael jahrer yehuda koren martin piotte andreas and volinsky for their superb work advancing and integrating significant techniques to achieve this the prize was awarded in a ceremony in new york city on september we will post a video on this forum of the presentation the delivered about their prize algorithm in accord with the rules winning team has prepared a system description consisting of papers which we both make public team pragmatic chaos edged out team the ensemble with winning submission coming just minutes before the conclusion of nearly contest historically the leaderboard only reported team scores on the quiz subset the prize is based on test subset score now that the contest is closed will be updating the leaderboard to report team scores on both the and quiz to everyone who participated in the netflix prize made this truly remarkable contest and brought great innovation to field we applaud you for your contributions and we hope the journey the netflix prize contest is now we will soon be launching a new contest netflix prize stay for more the winning papers submitted to the judges can be found these papers build on and require familiarity with work published the progress y koren the bellkor solution to the netflix grand a m jahrer r bell the bigchaos solution to netflix grand prize m piotte m chabbert the pragmatic theory solution to netflix grand prize registered posts grand prize awarded to team pragmatic congrats to everyone does anyone have any video of the award here are links that popped up immediately for me today i hope see other coverage also and many thanks to netflix for continuing acc to these articles the new contest will focus on a shorter period over in yr and work with the users with sparse attempting to improve rating estimation based on demographic data as location gender movies rented etcetera and its still prize cant really ask for

this data set and used it in their solution had unfair advantage over those who know the difference winning an losing could have been just that given the photo that we it is unfortunate that the fairness of such a major competition compromised by something that registered posts grand prize awarded to team pragmatic for those interested in some additional numbers including the rmse a blend of bpc and the ensemble we posted them on our httpaddr the blend quoted there is not the theoretical best value which require drilling down to the constituent prediction sets that make the two final

httpaddr the netflix prize was brilliant google and microsoft should the httpaddr as to the quote that this contest proves that most fail by sorry i dont have his name handy maybe just throwaway comment but i must respectfully strongly every aspect of the competition arguably contributed to the and collaboration in particular collaboration demonstrably had effect of pushing the bar ever the contest can be seen as an evolution in collaboration the results were mainly by individuals think simon funk the team began to coalesce and combine and in the end entire teams and recombined anyone who thinks collaboration was not at the heart of this competition is just very mistaken id say publishing results is also a method of collaboration among teams and we see collaboration by netflix to participate with conferences the key words for this is symbiosis and feedback the feedback loops the better the scoreboard is a feedback publishing results is a feedback loop the online forum is a loop the two conferences are feedback loops teams combining is feedback loop media coverage is yet another feedback loop collaboration is tightly coupled with all what is true is that most contestants fail to win first place that was known prior to the competition its an intrinsic property all competitions in general not of the netflix prize in also winning st place is of course not the only good reason i will take an analogy from biology that some might laugh or cringe but which i would argue is highly meaningful and analogous there only one egg and millions of sperm only a single sperm fertilizes egg and its superiority over the nd best sperm is surely so close nothing as to be therefore a contest among humans is similar to the fertilization of egg a mechanism that has been tested and reused by evolution uncountable species over maybe hundreds of millions of and of course the internet is a massive naturally for this to play last edited by vzn registered posts grand prize

occasionally just in case something turned up on the i knew about the extra data and tried my best to incorporate it several different but it never lowered the rmse of any of methods noticeably nor did it improve blended results in some it actually made things worse eventually i stopped using the data altogether perhaps this denotes a lack of cleverness on my but heard similar reports from other

team did not use it at registered posts grand prize awarded to team pragmatic regarding the data much ado about given the negligible size of that data and its quality no ratings there was no much hope that it we the winning team did not use it at i have to contradict my teammate although it change conclusion the data contains ratings with values which represent less than of the training data additional data contains no date which is very inconvenient when with the more accurate time dependant pragmatictheory experimented with this extra data and one set in grand prize solution makes use of it our observation that addition of the extra data did not make a measurable to the model nor did it contribute to the got registered posts grand prize awarded to team pragmatic anybody knows if the second contest is being already registered posts grand prize awarded to team pragmatic based on the prompt i got recently at netflix to accept the terms service i think they are still trying to

hope that it hi first congratulations on your win this is a great regardless of whether you won by minutes or a full percentage everyone will agree that your team and have put the quality effort in this competition and it is poetic justice that guys came out on there is absolutely no blame or diminished value for your teams of the kdd data the blame lies squarely on netflix who undoubtedly made a naive mistake in an otherwise highly as you can see from the web page it would have taken than a basis point of performance to give them the additional win according to the digit rounding rule i have no idea if they used the kdd labeled points or not nor if that would have made difference or not but any way you look at it netflix made sophomoric mistake by allowing the kdd data to be used informing all the contestants about it via last edited by statistician registered posts grand prize awarded to team pragmatic netflix wasted the million dollars i have been a member for years and i have always been happy with recommendations until today based on my star rating of mean machine an english remake of the longest yard starring vinnie jones and jason netflix recommended dead man seriously dead man walking i could do a better job of with a epic from registered posts grand prize awarded to team pragmatic i think even if you think this movie like you definetly it like you so rent it watch it and then you will love it for sure because not everything is work i recommend httpaddr from registered posts grand prize awarded to team pragmatic statistician writes i have no idea if they the ensemble have the kdd labeled points or i was a member of the ensemble and had not heard of the kdd till i read this thread on it is highly unlikely that of our members took advantage of statistician writes everyone will agree that your team bellkor and have put the most quality effort in this i agree that bellkor etc maintained the highest level of quality the entire course of the competition but what about the quality of effort in the last month or so during our existence the quality of that effort was amazing we were reducing rmse so quickly that our quiz rmse would have been than our hours after the close of the if we had been allowed to submit in the end we were beaten the rule but this was a winner all competition and we all knew the rules so i add congratulations to

time vehicles that are judged to be unsafe will not be allowed compete in the event of any conflict the decision will i indemnification and teams will be required to sign an application form prior to along with the application form there will be a waivers claims that will need to be signed by each individual who will participating at the additionally the sponsoring institution will also be to

officials will try to adhere to the official competition details rules and format as much as however it reserves the right to change or modify the where deemed necessary for preserving fairness of the modifications if any will be announced prior to the competition early as ii autonomous challenge all teams must pass qualification to participate in this ii a fully autonomous unmanned ground robotic vehicle must around an outdoor obstacle course under a prescribed time maintain a minimum of speed of one mph and a maximum speed limit of mph remaining the lane negotiating flags and avoiding obstacles on the judges will rank the entries that complete the course based on adjusted time taken in the event that a vehicle does not finish course the judges will rank the entry based on longest distance traveled adjusted time and distance are the net scores by judges after taking penalties incurred from obstacle collisions boundary crossings into ii vehicle vehicles must be unmanned and autonomous they must compete based their ability to perceive the course environment and avoid vehicles cannot be remotely controlled by a human operator competition all computational power sensing and control must be carried on board the vehicle there will be no base allowed for position accuracy allowed teams are encouraged to map course and use that information to improve their performance on ii obstacle the course will be laid out on grass over an area of approximately meters long by meters wide and be feet in length distance is identified so teams can set their maximum speed to the course pending no prior violations resulting in run track width will vary from ten to twenty feet wide with a radius not less than five the course outer boundaries will be designated by continuous or white lane markers lines approximately three inches wide painted the ground track width will be approximately ten feet wide with turning radius not less than five feet alternating dashes will be feet long with feet separation a speed will be required of one mph and will be a requirement qualification and verified in each run of the autonomous challenge the vehicle is not average one mph for the first feet from starting line the vehicle run will be ended the vehicle will need to average over one mph to complete the course within the minute time competitors should expect natural or artificial inclines with not to exceed and randomly placed obstacles along the course course will become more difficult to navigate autonomously as progresses obstacles on the course will consist of various white orange brown green black etc of construction drums are used on roadways and highways natural obstacles such as trees shrubs and manmade obstacles such as light posts or street signs also appear on the course the placement of the obstacles may randomized from left right and center placements prior to every there will be a minimum of six feet clearance minimum passage between the line and the obstacles ie if the obstacle is in middle of the course then on either side of the obstacle will be feet of driving space or if the obstacle is closer to one side of lane then the other side of the obstacle must have at least six feet driving space for the vehicles also on the course there will complex barrel arrangements with switchbacks and center islands will be adjusted for location between runs direction of the course will not change between alternating red right flags and green left flags will be placed the later part of the course flags will have a minimum passage between them of six feet ie if the flag is near the edge of course then between the flag and the line will be six feet of space flags are not obstacles and vehicles can touch flags increase speed and optimized route vehicles are not allowed to go flags the objective is for the vehicle to stay to the right of the flags and to the left of the green flags flags can be staggered the vehicle could be driving through a set of practice autonomous flag configurations autonomous challenge will contain eight global positioning system waypoints one in each corner four total and one at each opening four at the intersection openings vehicles will to use the waypoints to get from point a to point b in the course figure above the two pair of navigation waypoints the team use to go point to point either to or to the open between the navigation waypoints will contain a mix of obstacles must be avoided while staying the teams will have to choose how they want to run the course there be two paths that are the same distance in length and teams can choose always to run the same path or run any combination the two paths examples of the paths would be start and go from or start and go from point teams do not have cross through the actual points they are there to assist and use the team seem ii competition the competition will take place in the event of light rain drizzle but not in heavy rain or each qualified team will have the up to two runs time in each of three will assign a designated starting order will setup in that order failure to be will you at the end of the order for the run and may forfeit you second run in a heat based on heat time no team participant is allowed on the course before the first run and only one team member is allowed on the course a run this shall in no case be the faculty at the designated time the competing team will be asked prepare their vehicle for an attempt teams start in order they arrive in the starting area unless they give way another the starting official will call teams to the starting line starting direction is final the starting official alter the order to enhance the competition flow of entries slower vehicles may be grouped together to allow the running of vehicles on the course a team will have one minute in the starting point to prep vehicle for the judge to start the the judge will start the vehicle by a one touch motion hitting the enter key of a keyboard a left mouse click the up flipping a toggle switch an attempt will be declared valid when a designated judge gives start signal at the designated competing time an attempt continue until one of the following the vehicle finishes the the vehicle was by a the team the five minutes have passed after the vehicle run has the vehicle has not started after one minute after moving to start line or at the teams will ready the vehicle for start and advice the igvc judge push one button to start the vehicle the vehicle must be ready a judges start command in one an official will carry the time for each heat will be strictly tactile sensors will not be each vehicle will be given minutes per attempt to complete course if the vehicle has not completed the course in the time period it will ended by a choice with no assigned for that each vehicle must navigate the course by remaining inside the boundaries and navigating around course obstacles for the traffic violations the appropriate ticket will be issued and from the overall distance or time score refer to section ii violation ii practice all teams that have qualified will be given six each token represent one opportunity to use the autonomous practice course the course will be open daily for use from the time team qualifies till the start of the third heat of the challenge the course will be run like the autonomous challenge the same rules and similar obstacles one token allows a maximum six minutes one minute at the start point and five minutes for run on the autonomous challenge practice course in that time must position your vehicle at the start prep the vehicle for the to start and can continue to run as long as you do not break any the rules of the autonomous challenge if so your run and time will be ended all teams will still have unlimited access to regular practice ii traffic violation traffic ticket end of time to leave the careless choice choice blocking loss of wrong side of run over too slow did not go traffic must maintain mph there will be a speed at foot mark of the course will result in end of run with leave the all portions of the vehicle cross boundary the overall distance will be measured from the line to the furthest point where the final part of the crossed the boundary outside crash the overall distance will be measured from the starting to the collision point with the careless driving crossing the boundary while at least some part the vehicle remains in student student is used if the team feels there may be damaged caused to their vehicle or they know that is stuck and want to end their judge the overall distance will be measured from starting line to the front of the vehicle or where remaining part of vehicle if stopped crossed boundary outside obstacle displacement defined as displacing permanently obstacle from its original position an with no permanent displacement is not considered blocking traffic vehicles stopping on course for over one will be stopped and loss of payload if the payload falls of the vehicle the run be wrong side of flag vehicles must remain on the left side of flags and the right side of green run over flag vehicles drive over the top of a red or green will results in end of too slow if the vehicle does not maintain mph minimum limit throughout the course there will be a large penalty asset the ii how competition will be a team of judges and officials will determine compliance with designated competition judges will determine the official distances and ticket deductions of each entry at the end of competition those vehicles crossing the finish line will be on the time taken to complete the course minus any deductions ticket values will be assessed in seconds one foot one second if the vehicle completes the course within the minute run the team with the adjusted shortest time will be declared in the event that no vehicle completes the course the score be based on the distance traveled by the vehicle minus the deductions the team with the adjusted longest distance will declared the for standard award money consideration entry must sufficient degree of autonomous mobility by passing the barrel the money barrel location is determined by the during the course layout if a tie is between entries the award money will be split between ii grounds for judges will disqualify any vehicle which appears to be a hazard or violate the safety requirements during the intentional interference with another vehicle data link will result in disqualification of the damaging the course or deliberate movement of the obstacles running over the obstacles may result in actions designed to damage or destroy an vehicle are in the spirit of the competition and will result disqualification of the offending iii design all teams must participate in the design iii although the ability of the vehicles to negotiate competition courses is the ultimate measure of product quality officials are also interested in the design strategy and process engineering teams follow to produce their vehicles design judging be by a panel of expert judges and will be conducted separate from without regard to vehicle performance on the test course judging be based on a written report an oral presentation and examination the design innovation is a primary objective of this competition will be given special attention by the judges innovation is to be a technology hardware or software that has not ever been by this or any other vehicle in this competition the innovation to be documented as an innovation clearly in the written report emphasized in the oral iii written the report should not exceed pages graphic material and all appendices but not including the title reports will lose points in scoring for each page over spacing must be at least with at least a point font each vehicle must have a distinct and complete report its own a report cannot cover more than one are required to submit four hard copies of the report and an copy in pdf format on a cd failure to submit either of these result in disqualification all reports both for new vehicles and earlier vehicles with design changes must include a statement by the faculty advisor certifying that the design and engineering the vehicle original or changes by the current student team has significant and equivalent to what might be awarded credit in a design course the certification should also include a description of the areas in which changes have been made to a from a previous year everything must be mailed so as to arrive by addressed bernard curie warren mi written reports arriving after that date will lose points scoring for each business day late electronic copies arriving that date will lose points in scoring for each business day teams are encouraged to submit reports even several weeks early avoid the last minute rush of preparing vehicles for the and there will be no penalty for last minute changes in the from the design reported the electronic copy of the report will posted on the web site in pdf format after the of the the paper should present the conceptual design of the vehicle its components especially important to highlight are any innovative aspects of the design and the intelligence aspects of vehicle also included must be descriptions design planning electrical signal plan for path software both solid dashed plan for control system integration high speed design of the lane following and obstacle systems must be specifically described along with how the uses mapping techniques to perceive and navigate through environment describe how the system uses gps for waypoint and components acquired must be identified but their components need not be described in detail the steps followed the design process should be described along with any use design how considerations of reliability and durability were addressed in the design process be specifically described as well as problems encountered in design process and how they were overcome the analysis leading to predicted performance of the vehicle should be ramp climbing reaction battery distance at which obstacles are how the vehicle deals with complex obstacles switchbacks and center islands dead ends traps and accuracy of arrival at navigation comparison of these predictions with actual trial data although cost itself is not a factor in judging these are research vehicles the report should include a cost estimate counting student labor for the final product if it were to duplicated a breakdown of the cost by component is the team organization and the names of all members of the team with academic department and class should be included along an estimate of the total number of vehicles that have been entered in igvc in earlier years and not had significant changes in design are ineligible in either design or performance events vehicles that have been significantly in design hardware or software from an earlier year eligible but will require a completely new design report pages less treating both the old and new features thus describing complete vehicle as if it were all judges will score the written reports as maximum conduct of the design process and team including software completeness of the quality of documentation english grammar and effective innovation represented in the design as described del description of mapping description of electronic description of software description of systems descriptions to include lane following obstacle avoidance and waypoint navigation gps or efficient use of power and attention given to safety reliability and iii oral the technical talk should relate the highlights of the report described above and include any updates of the design since written report audio or video tape presentations of the text are allowed but graphic aids may be presented by video slide computer projection overhead transparencies or easel charts presentation must be made by one or more student members of the team the judges and other interested members of the audience and should not more than minutes a penalty of points will be assessed each minute or fraction thereof over minutes after presentation judges only may ask questions for up to minutes audience should be considered as a senior management group of knowledgeable engineers upon whom the project is dependent for and the team is dependent for their employment scoring will be judges will score the oral presentations as maximum clear and understandable explanation of logical organization of effective use of graphic demonstrated simulation of vehicle control in performance response to effective use of graphic aids includes not blocking the view the screen by the presenter and simple enough graphics that are enough to read block diagrams rather than detailed circuit articulation refers to the clarity and loudness of speaking to questions means short answers that address only the salesmanship refers to the enthusiasm and pride exhibited why vehicle is the participants are responsible for providing their own visual aids related equipment the vehicle itself may be projector will be made available projectors also be supplied by the during the oral presentation the following question period and examination of the vehicle team members sitting the audience participate by assisting the oral presenters but at no time is faculty advisor to participate in this part of the design iii examination of the the vehicle must be present and will be examined by the preferably immediately after the oral presentation or at convenient time the time during the competition software is included in this judging judging will be as judges will score the vehicle examinations as maximum packaging neatness efficient use of degree of original content in the vehicle as opposed to style overall iii final the number of points awarded by the individual judges will averaged for each of the judging areas above and these results be offered to each participating team for their edification the of the average scores over all areas max will be used determine the when two teams of judges are used due to a large number entries each judging team will determine the top three winners their group and the resulting six contestants will participate in runoff of oral presentations and vehicle examinations judged by judges to determine an overall design winner the six teams will judged in random for the finals competition three criteria from the written judging will be added to the normal oral presentation scoring above for preliminary judging thus the finals oral scoring will have maximum points as judges will score the final presentations as maximum clear explanation of description of mapping description of electronic description of software description of system logical organization of the effective use of graphic demonstrated simulation of vehicle response to the vehicle examination scoring will be the same as in the judging as shown iv navigation all teams must pass qualification to participate in this iv navigation is a practice that is thousands of years old it used on land by hikers and soldiers on the sea by sailors and in air by pilots procedures have continuously improved to moss on trees to dead reckoning to observation to use of the gps the challenge in this event is for vehicle to autonomously travel from a starting point to a number target destinations waypoints or landmarks and return to home given only the coordinates of the targets in latitude and iv it is expected that most contestants will use differential but gps is allowed as well as dead reckoning compasses gyros and wheel odometers vision systems sonar laser rangefinders may be used for obstacle detection there are number of handheld gps systems that connect to laptop available on the market for under garmin magellan are some earthmate even has one for macintosh these may be convenient to integrate in vehicle control programs differential gps units are available from hemisphere gps thales magellan garmin novatel and starlink and possibly differential correction signals are available in the southeast area from the us coast guard waas or any of the suppliers of corrections are also allowed the use of a base to supplement the on board gps unit is not iv gps the map in the figure below shows a typical course for the challenge this is a practice map for use by teams during of their vehicle coordinates for the actual navigation waypoints and the origin will be given to the contestants on june in degrees latitude and longitude but no xy coordinates will provided there will be three meter square finish boxes for each heat outside the main course in which teams will set up vehicles before their the competition course will be run on grass and will be by meters roughly acre and the total travel distance the course will be on the order of meters depending on the chosen for the vehicles the exact waypoint locations will be marked the grass for use by the judges but there will be no standup to indicate those positions construction barrels barricades and certain other obstacles will be located on the course in positions that they must be circumvented to reach the waypoints may be randomly moved between the course will be divided into two areas by a fence with a two wide opening located somewhere along it no coordinates are the opening will be randomly relocated along the fence at the start each run waypoints south of the fence the valley will have meter diameter circles or squares around them visible only to judges and waypoints north of the fence the mesa will have two circles around no team participant is allowed on the course before the first run and only one team member is allowed on the course during run this shall in no case be the faculty practice navigation iv practice all teams will have access to the practice course the navigation challenge practice course will have obstacles to the ones on the navigation challenge there will be minimum of three practice waypoints on the course for teams to their system iv run procedure and there will be three heats during the day with start and stop times same as those in the autonomous challenge it is intended that team will be allowed up to two runs in each heat there will be starting boxes so each team that manages three runs will start each of the boxes during the course of three heats in order teams should choose any free starting that they have not been in before until they have started in three after three runs they will begin the cycle of boxes again trial with the best performance will be used for scoring times will be within each heat except teams up for their first trial will have priority over those wanting second trial it is unlikely that there will be time in the day all registered teams to get six vehicles will park in the starting box selected and have up to minutes or until the course is clear for final adjustments starting vehicles may seek the waypoints in any order and vehicle actually reaching the most waypoints counting also boxes in the allotted six minute run time will be winner the vehicle must finish in the same box in which it if two or more vehicles reach the same number of waypoints the doing so in the least time will be declared the leader if two or vehicles reach the same number of waypoints while stopped by rule they will be declared tied and will share any if a vehicle any part fails to come within two meters of target in the southern area of the course or one meter in the area it will not be judged to have reached that target in order qualify for standard award money a vehicle must reach at least waypoints not counting the iv run all runs will be terminated by an by the students or judges signaled by a whistle or bell when the vehicle arrives back at the original point enters any box any time after first if any part of the vehicle leaves the perimeter of the field than at a if the vehicle strikes any if six minutes have elapsed since the start of the run in six minutes is miles per in all cases the call will be v jaus participation in the jaus challenge is v technical each entry will interface with the cop providing information specified below the general approach to the jaus interface will be respond to a periodic status and position requests from the cop requires the support of the jaus transport specification the jaus core service set the jaus transport supports several communication protocols the competition will use the ethernet based judp the core services required for the include the discovery access control and management services jaus mobility service set as or defines messaging to be used for position communications and waypoint v common operating the cop will provide a high level view of the systems in operation successfully implement the jaus protocol as described above software is a simple validation reporting and recording tool for judges to use while verifying student implementations of the standard it provides a graphical display of the operational area relative coordinates primitive graphics are loaded in the display the cop to add perspective each reported status is displayed on cop user interface and recorded for future reference for and systems reporting positional data a d map on the cop display annotated with the updated position as well as track marks showing previous position of the system for the current v communications the teams will implement a wireless or hardwired rj data link the interface can be implemented at any point in student system including the control station or the internet protocol ip address to be used will be provided at competition for planning purposes this address will be in the of to the cop will have and capabilities where the ip address of the will be all teams will be provided an ip address to used during the competition the last octet of the ip address significant as it will also be used as the subsystem identifier in jaus id the port number for all jaus traffic shall be v jaus specific the jaus id mentioned above is a critical piece of data used by a node to route messages to the correct process or attached device indicated above each team will be provided an ip address in which last octet will be used in their respective jaus id a jaus id of three elements a subsystem id a node id and a component id subsystem id uniquely identifies a major element that is an system an unmanned system controller or some other entity on a with unmanned systems a node id is unique within a subsystem identifies a processing element on which jaus components can be a component id is unique within a node represents an to from which jaus messages are sent and received the last octet of assigned ip address will be used as the jaus subsystem id for the team assigned the ip address of the jaus id of the component might be where node and component are both assigned the ids of this is shown in ip and jaus id assignment figure below the node id and component are discussed further in the jaus service definition language standard the cop software will programmed with the assumption that all services required by specific competition are implemented on a single ip and jaus id in summary each team will be assigned an ip address by the judges last octet of that ip address will be the subsystem the cop will be a subsystem as will each entry in competition the cop will have a jaus id of and an ip address the port number shall be v competition task messages passed between the cop and the team entries will include as described in the task descriptions below the cop will initiate requests subsequent to the discovery process described as task system management component is required of all teams this will implement several of the messages defined by the service defined in the this service inherits the control events and transport services also defined by the document the implementation of the access control interfaces will necessary to meet the jaus challenge requirements however no from the events service will be exercised the sequence diagram discovery and system management figure shows the required for discovery including the access control setup and system protocol this interaction is required for every the judges will evaluate each ability to meet interoperability challenge for the tasks described below in with the scoring judges will score the task as maximum transport capabilities system velocity state position and orientation waypoint v transport for any two elements in the system to communicate meaningful data must first be a handshake to ensure both sides use the same and are willing participants in the interaction for the sake simplicity the entry shall initiate the discovery protocol the cop and the ip address and jaus id of the cop shall fixed the ip address and jaus id of the cop are defined cop ip address cop jaus id the discovery process in discovery and system management figure occur at the application layer the student jaus element send a request for identification to the cop once every seconds cop will respond with the appropriate informative message and identification in return from the jaus interface after identification report from the cop the team entry will stop the request this transaction will serve as the basic discovery the two the cop software will be programmed with the assumption that services required by the specific competition are provided at single jaus id furthermore as per the specification entry shall receive judp traffic at the same ip address and number that initiated the discovery

vary between students what does it for one problem to be similar to another it might depend on the knowledge required for one problem is the same as the required for another but is it possible to infer the requirements of problems directly from student performance without human analysis of the this challenge asks you to predict student performance mathematical problems from logs of student interaction with tutoring systems this task presents interesting technical has practical importance and is scientifically kdd cup task at the start of the competition we will provide data sets development data sets and challenge data sets each of the data will be divided into a training portion and a test portion specified on the data page student performance labels will withheld for the test portion of each data set the competition will be to develop a learning model based on the challenge development data sets use this algorithm to learn from the portion of the challenge data sets and then accurately predict performance in the test sections at the end of the competition actual winner will be determined based on their performance an unseen portion of the challenge test sets we will only each last submission of the challenge you will be allowed to train on the training portion of each data and will then be evaluated on your performance at providing first attempt values for the test portion we will provide feedback formatting errors in prediction files but we will not reveal on test data until the end of the competition note that for each file you submit an unidentified portion will be used to validate data and provide scores for the leaderboard while the portion will be used for determining the winner of the for a valid submission the evaluation program will compare predictions you provided against the undisclosed true values and the difference as root mean squared error if a data set file missing from a submission the evaluation program will report the as for that file the total score for a submission will then be average of the rmse values all data sets will receive equal weight the final average independent of their at the end of the competition the winner will be the team with lowest total technical in terms of technical challenges we mention just a the data matrix is sparse not all students are given problem and some problems have only or students who each item so the contestants need to exploit relationships problems to bring to bear enough data to hope to there is a strong temporal dimension to the data students over the course of the school year students must master skills before moving on to others and incorrect responses to items lead to incorrect assumptions in other items so must pay attention to temporal relationships as well as relationships among which problems a given student sees is determined in part student choices or past success history eg students only remedial problems if they are having trouble with the problems so contestants need to pay attention to relationships in order to avoid selection scientific and practical from a practical perspective improved models could be saving of hours of time and effort in learning algebra models should both increase achievement levels and reduce time focusing on just the latter for the million students that about hours per year with cognitive tutors for say these optimizations can reduce time to mastery by at one experiment showed the time reduction was about cen et hours per student or million student hours year saved and this million is less than of all students in the us if we include all algebra students x and grades for which there are carnegie learning assistment applications x that brings our rough estimate to million student hours per year saved in that time students can moving on in math and science or doing other things they from a scientific viewpoint the ability to achieve low error on unseen data is evidence that the learner has discovered the underlying factors which make items easier or harder students knowing these factors is essential for the design curricula and lesson plans both for human instructors for automated tutoring so you the contestants have potential to influence lesson design improving retention student engagement reducing wasted time and increasing transfer future currently k education is extremely focused on assessment the child left behind act has put incredible pressure on schools to to the test meaning that a significant amount of time is preparing and taking standardized tests much of the time drilling for and taking these tests is wasted from the point of view deep learning retention transfer and desire for learning so any advances which allow us to reduce the role standardized tests hold the promise of increasing deep to this end a model which accurately predicts performance as a byproduct of tutoring could augment replace some of the current standardized tests this idea is assistment from the goal of assessing performance simultaneously assisting learning previous work has suggested assistment is indeed possible eg an appropriate analysis tutoring logs can predict standardized performance as well as standardized test results can standardized test performance feng heffernan but it is far from clear what the best prediction methods so the algorithms may provide insights that important improvements in fundamental if a student is correct at one problem eg starting with a if i multiply it by and then add i get number at one time how likely are they to be correct at problem eg solve for x at a later these questions are of both scientific interest and importance scientifically relevant deep questions include what is nature of human knowledge representations and how generally do transfer their learning from one situation to another human do not always represent and solve mathematical tasks as we expect you might be surprised if you thought that a student working the second problem above the equation is likely to correct given that he was correct on the first problem the problem it turns out that most students are able to solve simple problems like this one more successfully than the matched koedinger nathan koedinger alibali nathan other words there are interesting surprises to be found in performance cognitive tutors for mathematics are now in use in more than schools across the us for some students per year while systems have been quite successful surprises like the one suggest that the models behind these systems can be much improved generally a number of studies have demonstrated how detailed task analysis can result in dramatically better instruction feldon van merrienboer yates early lee such analysis is painstaking and requires a high level of expertise we believe it possible that machine learning on large sets can reap many of the benefits of cognitive task analysis without the great effort and

appear in leaderboard instead of the real name participant emails will appear anywhere on the website and will be used only by the to communicate with the participants to be eligible for prizes participants will have to publicly reveal their identity and the box make my profile teams to register a team only register the team leader and choose nickname for your team let you know later how to disclose members of your team we limit each team to one final entry as individual you cannot enter under multiple names this would considered cheating and would disqualify you nor can you under multiple teams multiple teams from the same however are allowed so long as each team leader is a different and the teams do not intersect during the development period team must have a different registered team leader to be ranked in challenge and qualify for prizes each registered individual or team leader will have to disclose the names of team members before the final results of the challenge get hence at the end of the challenge you will have to choose to team you want to belong only one before the results are released if a person participates in multiple teams those teams be disqualified after the results are released no change in composition will be allowed before the end of the challenge the leaders will have to declare the composition of their team this have to correspond to the list of in the proceedings they decide to publish their results hence a professor cannot name on all students papers but can be thanked a team can be either a student team eligible for or not a student team eligible for travel in a student a professor should be cited appropriately but in the spirit of competition student teams should consist primarily of student work will ask

records of interactions students and systems the students problems in the tutor and each interaction between the student computer is logged as a transaction four key terms form the blocks of our data these are problem step knowledge component opportunity to more concretely define these terms use following using a computer tutor for geometry a student completes a where she is asked to find the area of a piece of scrap metal left after removing a circular area the end of a can from a metal figure the student enters everything in the worksheet except the row labels and the column and labels for the first figure a problem from carnegie cognitive tutor a problem is a task for a student to perform that typically multiple steps in the example above the problem asks the student find the area of a piece of scrap metal left over after removing circular area the end of a can from a metal square figure row labeled in the worksheet corresponds to a in language domains such tasks are more often called activities exercises rather than problems a language activity for example involve finding and correcting all of the grammatical errors in a step is an observable part of the solution to a problem steps are observable they are partly determined by the user available to the student for solving the problem it is necessarily the case that the interface completely determines steps for example the student might be expected to create new rows columns of a table before filling in their in the example problem above the steps for the first question find the radius of the end of the can a find the length of the square find the area of the end of the find the area of the square find the area of the this whole collection of steps comprises the solution the last can be considered the answer and the others are students might not and often do not complete a problem by only the correct steps the student might request a hint from tutor or enter an incorrect value we refer to the actions of student that is working towards performing a step correctly transactions a transaction is an interaction between the student the tutoring system each hint request incorrect attempt or attempt is a transaction and each recorded transaction is referred as an attempt for a in table transactions have been consolidated and displayed student and step producing a step record table this is

information that can be used accomplish tasks perhaps along with other knowledge knowledge component is a generalization of everyday terms like principle fact or skill and cognitive science terms like production rule misconception or each step in a problem requires the student to know something relevant concept or skill to perform that step correctly in data sets each step can be labeled with one or more knowledge components needed see the last column of table example kc labels in line of table the researcher hypothesized that the student needs to know to pogarea in line the knowledge component hypothesized to be needed to answer every knowledge component is associated with one or more steps one more knowledge components can be associated with a step association is typically originally defined by the problem author researchers can provide alternative knowledge components associations with steps together these are known as a component an opportunity is a chance for a student to demonstrate whether he she has learned a given knowledge component a count for a given knowledge component increases by each time student encounters a step that requires this knowledge component the opportunity count column of table for an opportunity is both a test of whether a student knows a component and a chance for the student to learn it while students make multiple attempts at a step or request hints from a tutor are transactions the whole set of attempts are considered a opportunity as a student works through steps in problems have multiple opportunities to apply or learn a knowledge for all competition data sets each record will be a step that the following row the row number update for challenge data the row number in each file train test and submission is

correct first the competition will use data sets development data sets and challenge data sets from different tutoring systems these data come from multiple schools over multiple school years the include the the carnegie learning algebra system deployed and and the bridge to algebra system deployed the development data sets have previously been used in research and available through the pittsburgh science of learning center as well as this the challenge data sets will come from same tutoring systems for subsequent school years the challenge sets have not been made available to researchers prior to the kdd each data set will be broken into two files a training file and a file a third file a submission file will be provided for results the submission file will contain a subset of the columns the test each data set will be split as in the diagram above each horizontal line represents a record of a student working on a step the data set is broken down student unit a classification of a portion of the math hierarchy eg linear inequality graphing section a portion the curriculum that falls within a unit eg section of test rows are determined by a program that randomly selects one for each student within a unit and places all rows that student and problem in the test file based on time all rows for the unit will be placed in a training file all following rows for that unit will be discarded goal at testing time will be to predict whether the student got step right on the first attempt for each step in that problem prediction will take the form of a value between and for the correct first for each test file you submit an unidentified portion will be used validate your data and provide scores for the leaderboard while remaining portion will be used for determining the winner of how to format and ship to submit your results you must return the results in a separate file for each data set using the same filename as the submission file these text files must be grouped into one archive can upload either results for the development data sets or challenge data sets but not both at the same time you may results on a subset of data sets to get online each submission file will contain two row the row number as carried over from the original data file update for challenge data sets the row in each file train test and submission is no longer taken the original data set file instead rows are renumbered each file so instead of n rows for the training file rows for the file it is now n for training file and n for the correct first attempt your prediction value a decimal between and that indicates the probability of a correct attempt for this the upload page will reject submissions that are missing test provide test rows out of order contain duplicate test rows or row values that are not in the original test file it will also submissions that provide values in the correct first attempt that are not a decimal between and predictions must be for all rows if errors are detected in the file the upload page provide feedback as to where in the the errors to read about the evaluation process see the tasks go kdd cup winners

ecnusei go kdd cup what do the and mean on the leaderboard for development this is a bug that was an effect of adding cup scoring leaderboard you can ignore the cup scoring for data sets leaderboard scoring is the only meaningful score development data sets and a score based on the entire will you be making the challenge test set labels available now that contest has we have just the submissions and leaderboard to allow to continue working on their algorithms sometime later we hope release the full master data sets but have no definite plans at why are there now two alternate views of the during the kdd cup workshop some participants suggested that we the way the leaderboard works so that we display the same type scores that were used to determine the competition winners validating most of the predictions instead of a small that during the competition the evaluation process that powered leaderboard only looked at a small portion of participant files a much larger portion was used to determine the winners thought this suggestion was a great idea but we want to the leaderboard and individual submission pages in such a way that no longer reflected the scores and ranking given to participants at end of the competition as a solution added a toggle to leaderboard and individual submission pages allowing you to view the cup scoring where a majority of the prediction file is used score the entry or leaderboard scoring where a small portion of prediction file is used to score the entry we calculate both so can toggle between them cup scoring is more accurate but scoring is what was used during the competition to power registration and general the leaderboard just went blank and it says there are no is it safe to yes it is still safe to submit and the leaderboard has not been there is a bug in our system that is causing the leaderboard to empty under high load the submission and the leaderboard data still stored i get a verification email what should i contact us and tell us that you registered but received no email verify your account please do not create a new where can i find more info about the professors at wpi want to help undergrads compete professors heffernan ryan baker joe beck and carolina ruiz of polytechnic institute will be giving online webinar lectures at wpi posting them online for undergrads across the country they will suggestions on how to do well on the kdd cup this year going to give away some tools see their website for more httpaddr when can i register and download you can register april at pm edt and download data as soon can team members come from different team members can definitely come from different organizations the restriction on teams is that any person can only participate in single team see the rules for more information the difference between a student team and a a team can be either a student team eligible for or not a student team eligible for travel in a student a professor should be cited appropriately but in the spirit of competition student teams should consist primarily of student work will ask for participants to state whether they are a student prior to the end of the competition our sponsors have provided prizes for student does this mean there be any monetary prizes for participants other than travel rather than splitting the prizes among student and we decided that we will only award monetary prizes to students year since the cash prize would make the biggest difference for this way we can offer more consistent cash prizes while still a sizable travel award for all top placed participants for an participant we figure that being a top performer in the kdd cup worth way more in pr than the cash prize anyway plus our has been that in some cases providing cash prizes to participants creates more problems on their side than worth hope the lack of prizes for industry keep you from in the kdd cup this data what are the differences between development and challenge data development data sets are provided for familiarizing yourself with format and developing your learning model using them is optional your predictions on these data sets will not count toward the winner of the competition development data sets differ challenge sets in that the actual student performance values for prediction column correct first attempt are provided for all see the file ending in challenge data sets will be made available on april at pm predictions on these data sets will count toward determining the of the competition in each of these two data sets be asked provide predictions in the column correct first attempt for a of the steps for more information on which steps these will be the bottom of our data what are the different files in each data set zip file i this file contains all training rows for the data set but test rows use this file to train your learning this file contains only test rows for the data set you make predictions for all of these rows in the column first attempt but submit only the columns row and correct attempt see the submission file format a submission file composed of only columns row and first attempt this shows the format of a valid submission in which provide prediction values probabilities in second column note that only test rows are included training rows for development sets this file is only included for development data sets this file shows all the actual student performance values for test rows in prediction column correct first attempt it also values for the various time columns columns which are empty in the file these are documented on the data page up to how like to use the development data sets and the actual student performance your description of the data format states that there should be test problem composed of multiple step rows per student and unit i see more than one problem per in a development data i also see only a single test row per not the rows you describe this are some errors in the development data sets we might update development data sets to fix this issue but we will make sure happen in the challenge data sets expect only one problem in any challenge data set composed of one or more rows the purpose of releasing development data sets was to find issues in the data and to allow participants to familiarize with the data the file appears to end on a partial that has only fields and no line this is a bug in that development data set we plan to update development data set april update an updated version of the algebra data set with fixed final row is available on the data april do the steps for a given problem have to be completed in a no for a given problem the order of the steps completed could across students or it could be the same the set of steps could also vary or be the some problems some steps optional also note that for some steps the correct answer the enters could vary across students eg the tutor might have and or something more i see that there are some problems which have different number of when attempted by different students for example in unit problem eg has been attempted by multiple students but each the number of steps differs does the number of steps in a instantiation of a problem depend on the performance of the student the earlier steps of the same problem or even previously problems or is it by the tutor program for a instantiation and a student has to just attempt the steps sent by the number of steps you see for a problem could vary across based on performance within a problem eg the tutor might extra steps based on errors made or just based on the approach student took eg the student might skip optional i know of an example where performance on a prior problem affects number of steps in a later problem in the sense that the tutor control access to steps when looking at solver or grapher data unit referenced is an equation solver unit the number of steps always varies because these are somewhat exploratory environments steps steps that closer to the solution allowed so with respect to steps some tutored problems are than one of the fields is corrects which is described as total attempts by the student for the step only increases if the step encountered more than why would the same step come up than once in a this can happen in a few cases one case is where the tutoring allows the student to enter something and receive feedback but not lock the widget upon receiving the correct response an example a problem that includes an interactive graph where the student can the scale of the graph they can set the scale of the graph as times as like so long as they provide valid numbers each attempt is a correct one another case is in equation problems in these problems the student could transform the any number of times the step is represented as the current so if a transformation leads to an equation seen already number of corrects would increase by other cases probably exist the is each step uniquely identified by problem hierarchy problem and step name or is just problem name and step name a step row is uniquely identified by this student problem hierarchy problem name problem view update a bug in the data prevents this from always being the case may how should i interpret these long knowledge components i often see eliminate nested clt nested mult mult expr const expr division division both mult both mult both divide both divide the skill here is eliminate the items listed in the braces clt nested clt nested parens distribute mult right etc is just a static list of every operation that could trigger this skill the order of things is not at all meaningful is no hierarchical or sequential structure here it is simply how was listed by the tutor developer in fact any element in this may not be relevant to the particular problem the student was on this is simply a list of all possible operations that possibly be involved in triggering the skill in this case there are lot of operations which could trigger the eliminate parens can you tell me more about the kc models in the challenge data the extra columns mean that for the challenge data sets there additional kc models a kc model is a list of mappings between step and one or more knowledge components it is also known as transfer model or a skill model each kc model is represented by columns kc and within a model there can be multiple associated with a step when there are they are separated by corresponding opportunity numbers are also separated by and given in the same order so each kc has an opportunity count for a simple answer about these individual models is that rules is a categorization of similar steps and ktracedskills is more categorization rules corresponds with production rules in the tutor which get grouped that correspond with the ktracedskills believe there is a strict mapping between each of ktracedskills and instances of the rules but there may the ktracedskills level is used by the tutor to future problems and is presumed to be the level at which students learning and transferring their knowledge from one task step to another related one that presumption is not always born by the data and the rules kc model may provide clues to better clustering of steps to predict transfer of to summarize in a slightly different ktracedskills these are the skills that are the ones that appear on the subskills these are the skills identified by the system whether not they are being rules these are the actual rule names used to determine skills distinction between these and subskills is that this kc model include the actual model rules not the while subskills would be based on what does it mean for the current end time to be later than start time of the following in general steps can be interleaved a student can start working one step complete another step and return to the first step in and of this explanation great fit because row had no incorrect attempts meaning somehow the student started the finalanswer step and then seconds later completed it but perhaps finalanswer is representing class of final answers since there are corrects for that that would mean that a step called finalanswer was available for student to solve correctly times which they did without also our faq entry where we mention equation solving can you give us some suggestions about how to understand some names eg xr and is row column and indicates where this student appeared within the table that students are working within sure about xr but it may be better inferred from the other step in the same is there any manual of the tutor system it will be very helpful for to understand the system and data sets as we have never used tutoring system to learn more about the tutor see some of the papers about the tutor and some about relevant units in the bridge to algebra these include the ritter steven haverty lisa koedinger kenneth hadley corbett albert integrating intelligent software tutors the math classroom g blume and k heid eds research on and the teaching and learning of mathematics vol cases perspectives charlotte nc iap koedinger k r aleven v exploring the assistance in experiments with cognitive tutors educational psychology review you can use forward and backward pointers to and from the references these papers to find other potentially relevant papers so can at related web sites like learnlaborg httpaddr how can i verify the integrity of the files you can use the unix program and the following sha to verify the challenge another way to verify the files is to count the number of lines in training and test files add them together and compare this to number of steps reported on the downloads page you can use a command like wc l filename to count the number of lines in file note that the number of steps we report does not include header rows so your number is likely to be greater by one row in each why did you change the row numbering scheme for the challenge this change was intentional our primary concern was that the in the development sets left gaps between the such it was possible to infer how many more steps the student took to the unit by looking at the first row number of the next this numbering scheme eliminates that more specifically it is the gap between the test set of and the training set for that is the an example is shown old numbering gap between and is the student unit student unit student unit student unit student unit new numbering student unit student unit student unit student unit student unit derivable temporal with no gap student unit student unit student unit student unit student unit known noise in the in algebra i the knowledge components of some steps are they no this is incorrect in addition there are other kc names that cut off in similar ways we will fix this but since this issue is present in the development sets it is not a in algebra i some kcs have substring action after done expr subtract in expr solveroperation these names are not a problem the two arguments here are the input for the rule and the actual user input checking the user against the expected input is part of how the rule gets evaluated these cases because they are any action then any input is so the expected input is null in most of these cases the user seems to be null also except for the left indicating that the specified the of the you write that a step row is uniquely identified by this student problem hierarchy problem name problem view step true then why do i see duplicates for this it is true that there are duplicate not unique keys in the data sets we analyzed the development data sets but probably exist there too classify this issue as noise in data there should not be duplicate keys but there are the breakdown shows the extent of these duplicate keys in the files of the two challenge data algebra i training bridge to algebra keys unique keys unique duplicate keys duplicate percentage duplicates of total percentage duplicates the most times a key is duplicated is in the test data we found some rows with problem view values than since problem view is the total number of times the encountered the problem so far and each test row is determined by program that randomly selects one problem for each student within unit how could problem view be larger than when we created the test files we take problem view account so the result is that you may see more than one instance for a single pair in the test file this unintended but need to account for it in your the presence of more than one problem for a pair in test file will always take the form of all steps completed another instance of that same problem you can use the order of rows in the test file and the problem view values to relatively when the student worked on the same problem again note at the boundary between problem views at the point where problem increases the steps surrounding the boundary are not contiguous a student could have worked on the same problem much in in i find that almost every line has same start and end time the step duration is also equal to is unfortunately this is the case for all challenge data set files it is an issue in the raw data and as such we will not be to fix it not known whether the timestamp that is across all four time columns is the step start time step end time something else as we will not be able to correct this issue in data you will need to take it into seen duplicate knowledge components assigned to one step example in row the kc is defined and the opportunity numbers for those kcs the opportunity count just increase over this is a type of noise in the data we know why it occurs should ignore the second kc that is listed as well as its number you are right that for a student the kc opportunity should increase as time goes on and the student encounters steps that can we say for the same student the records along the row id listed along a time index ie for the same student a record with larger row id happens after a record with a smaller row no not a safe assumption for a couple of reasons first clarification about the format a record is a summary one or more student attempts transactions on a step each their own time stamp this means that one refer to a row happening at one time secondly attempts at different steps can interleaved therefore there is no guarantee that a student one step before starting another we can clarify the order of rows in either a training test file the order of these rows is determined by following rule for a given instance of student working on a order the rows by a field called step time which is the time of first correct transaction correct transaction time where given if there is no correct transaction the time of the last transaction the step step end we display this step time value we use it to order if the data is noisy however such as in algebra where same time is given across all time fields for the step and all steps the problem then the sorting within a problem is indeterminate say what order it is in since tried to sort rows based identical criteria similarly ordering problems for a student also be random if the same step time is used for more than one go kdd cup kdd cup john pslc datashop technical director carnegie mellon alexandru herman
