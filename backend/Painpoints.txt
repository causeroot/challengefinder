Better progress reporting/error reporting
    Things shouldn't break silently

generateWordList
    - Refetches EVERYthing every time
        Run on server with fat pipe (WHat factor speedup?)
        Local cache of fetched list LRU/time expiration

generateFeature
    - Completely broken

generateClassification
    - Our SVM doesn't pick up any good challenges

Future features
    - Automatic clustering of good/bad
        k-means...
