Better progress reporting/error reporting
    Things shouldn't break silently

generateWordList
    - Refetches EVERYthing every time -- FIXED!!! (2 min)
        Run on server with fat pipe (What factor speedup?)
            Vanilla badList on amber takes 58min: `time ./generateWordList simpleChallenge badList.url`
        Concurrent downloads
            With connection pooling (20 workers, 1 min timeout) 1min54sec for `time ./generateWordList simpleChallenge badList.url `
        Local cache of fetched list LRU/time expiration
    - Smarter wordlisting to feed the feature-sets
        Portstemming
        don't write single letters (& non-dictionary words?)

generateFeature
    - Completely broken -- FIXED!!!

generateSearchStrings
    - Searchterms detected have the wrong polarity  -- FIXED!!!

generateClassification
    - Our SVM doesn't pick up any good challenges
    - Weird deal with word frequency being equivalent to the "predictibility" of any one word
        Add frequency back in & see if it improves (or not)

Future features
    - Automatic clustering of good/bad
        k-means...
