http://www.dcresource.com/reviews/sony/dsc_s85-review/ dcrp review sony by jeff keller dcrp originally posted tuesday june last updated friday october printer friendly i first got a taste of at a private show and with sony high up in a san francisco skyscraper like a magic slowly unfolding things got better and better as the presentation along at first i figured it was just an enhanced with black body hey it worked for but then the removed his thumb revealing mega pixels on the body wow first camera i they asked me how much do you think something like this would i hate questions like that i first thought of the only camera i could recall the olympus but too expensive figured so i guessed they replied we wish we could uh oh too low i guess i replied nope wrong they told me i believe it with all the features camera promised at a great price i figure be flying off shelves but does it live up to the sales pitch keep in the the has a very good bundle inside the box the mpixel mb memory infolithium battery and ac lens cap neck usb featuring mgi photosuite software and page there really much to comment here since the bundle is good only real negative in my mind is the memory stick proprietary at least in digital cameras format also mb is a bit small for a camera that takes such large like all of cameras and camcorders the s uses the battery this battery tells you how many minutes are left until battery dies the included battery will last for roughly minutes before needing a charge recharging the fm takes about additional kudos to sony for including a lens cap with updated the is indeed mac os x friendly though you must visit the setup menu and change the usb mode to once done the image capture app will launch when the camera connected under mac os i find manuals not very user friendly the layout organization needs work just like the one included with look and the is pretty traditional looking and should be easy to pick up and use the body is a mix of metal and and feels solidly constructed it is a bit bulky so expect keep it in your pants pocket the dimensions of the camera are x inches w x h x d and it weighs g lb loaded this is the same as the begin our tour with the front of the the carl lens looks familiar i think seen this one before on epson and toshiba cameras this lens has a focal range of mm which is equivalent to mm the lens is threaded and a number of filters and lenses are available from the flash has an effective range of the other item of note on the front is the af illuminator using focusing in low light situations just left of the the back of the is where most of the action is the lcd bright and fluid though it liked to collect thumb prints nose will be a problem for those of you who use your left eye with optical above the lcd is the info display most often found on top of cameras in the shot above it shows battery life shots aperture shutter speed and flash just right of that is the zoom control which is for thumb access to the right of the zoom control is the thumb which is also a button that is used for adjusting manual such as shutter speed aperture and exposure on the other side of the lcd info display find an viewfinder the size is just right and diopter correction our fellow below that find the switch which is use for menus basic camera functions as well this quick review shows the last shot below that find buttons lcd exposure spot focus ae at the lower right of the photo you can see under a rubber cover port for the ac adapter included with on the top of the camera find the mode wheel shutter button microphone and a shoe for an external i found the shutter release button to be a bit sensitive at accidentally took photos on several the flash shoe is cold and uses a proprietary flash sync port see on the side of the camera in a second you can use flash for sure not sure if any others the mode wheel which has the power switch below it has a notchy feeling a good thing and has the following scene full aperture shutter auto movie some further explanation on scene mode choose between twilight portrait and landscape camera picks the best settings for these situations i how you have go to to the setup mode to change this aperture priority you pick the aperture the camera picks appropriate shutter speed the choices range from f f and vary a bit depending on the focal range shutter priority exactly the opposite you choose the speed and the camera picks the correct aperture you can from a number of speeds ranging from sec full manual you choose both the shutter speed and aperture values available are the same as on this side of the camera you can see the speaker accessory for an external flash usb port and out port those last ports are kept under a sturdy plastic not much is happening on the other side of the camera memory stick slot down at the bottom of the camera with the battery that plastic door find the slot for the fm battery as well the memory stick the stick slot is so easy remove find a metal tripod mount down here as using the sony record the camera turns on with much fanfare and takes about four seconds get ready to take photos when you depress the shutter release halfway it can take up to a second to lock focus when you press button all the way down the photo is taken with no delay recycle is very quick on the s about two seconds which is considering the size of these images writing a tiff file considerably longer locking up the camera for nearly record the zoom controls were fine though the lens continued to move a after the button is the has a number of choices for image size and quality out this table which describes image size photos on mb memory standard quality fine x x x x the menu system is pretty simple since many functions buttons rather than menu choices take a look at the various items and what they white balance one push auto indoor iso auto image size x x x photo quality fine rec mode tiff text voice exposure bracketing normal more on this flash level high normal photo effects solarize black white sepia negative art sharpness to the one push white balance mode is indeed a manual wb mode shoot piece of white paper or whatever you want to be white and able to get accurate color in almost any more details on those rec mode tiff uncompressed large image only one fits on mb text records a gif in black voice records an audio file along with a still records a x image in addition to the recorded exposure bracketing three shots in a row with different compensation values this feature is new to the burst records three images continuously at a interval of sec there is no real continuous shooting mode on camera due to a lack of buffer in setup mode there are a number of other options available here the interesting scene mode selection twilight landscape moving image mpeg movie clipmotion explained digital zoom bracket step for auto bracketing reduction af illuminator file numbering series conversion lens lcd usb connect normal ptp put it in ptp mode for mac os x it took me many tries to get a good macro shot but i finally got sample you see above i tried manual iso and succeeded in aperture priority mode with manual white you can shoot as close as cm in or cm in full in macro mode on the the camera was about average in the nightshot test the color is a off on the lights though messing with white balance settings may helped and a bit dark of course so is the sf skyline aside from that there are no unnatural stars in the sky or the photo quality on the s was excellent with accurate color major chromatic aberrations and good sharpness take a look at photo gallery to judge for movie movie modes is one of the best out there the video and quality is very good and you can fill up the memory stick with in modes the only downside is that you cannot use the optical or digital during there are three sizes available in movie movie size of seconds on mb memory hq clips can be sec x x the quality is highest in hq mode but limited to second clips in the other modes you can record until the stick i finally have exciting sample movies to show you no more panning buildings or watching cars go by this time roller shot in mode seconds shot in mode have to turn your head to view this way it was intended seconds there is also a feature called clipmotion which will take images put them into an animated gif for playback the playback mode goes beyond the basic features found most cameras those include slideshows dpof print marking thumbnail mode and zoom these advanced features copy copies an resize change an divide splits movies in trim when zoomed into an image you can crop the image down the selected area you choose the resolution of the new image old one is the only thing to remember here is that if take a small area of an image and then blow it up image you can get more information about photos by zooming out twice get a scrollable list of information that you can see i also liked a delete button rather than having to invoke menu every time i want to remove a the s moves between images quickly in playback mode and it shows low res version before a high res one replaces it the shows up almost instantly with the high res arriving about seconds how does it what can i say the is the first megapixel camera priced the masses and excellent the photo quality features and are all standouts my major concern with many of cameras is memory stick format not a fan of proprietary storage formats to mention batteries but this probably bother most other quibbles include the underwhelming nightshots and lack of continuous shooting aside from that the sony gets enthusiastic what i million pixels for under feature very good photo very good bundle except for memory manual white great movie mode with what i care no zoom in movie proprietary memory stick external flash port and nightshots could be no true continuous shooting as of this writing the only other announced megapixel cameras are the casio olympus and toshiba as always i recommend a trip to your local camera store to try out and its competitors if there are any when there you photo so how does the photo quality stand up check out the sample photos our photo want a second opinion how about a check out digicams review of the if not enough imaging resource has one jeff welcomes your

http://www.litgothic.com/Texts/anaconda.html the anaconda by matthew g text taken from romantic tales vol i london longman hurst and orme thanks to dr dick collins of inchigeela co cork ireland providing this etext to the literary dr dick note to the lord in heaven exclaimed the old man while every was convulsed with horror the blood forsook his cheeks and he his hands in agony the thing is he resumed after few moments passed in reflection impossible everard a boy whose childhood was passed under my own roof under very eye whose manners are so mild who was ever so gentle grateful so kind whose heart i know as well as i do my own bless soul sister milman what a fright you have given me but no matter now for when i reflect upon this history of yours i clearly that the thing is quite impossible and so an end was there ever anything so provoking brother brother let tell you that at your time of life it is quite a shame to yourself to be so blinded by prejudice his childhood was passed your roof forsooth but where did he pass his youth i should be to know why among tigers and alligators that swallow up poor little children at a mouthful and great ugly who eat nothing but human flesh heaven bless us and the wonder that living in such graceless company everard should picked up some of their bloody tricks nay brother to tell you a of my mind for my own part i always suspected that there something awkward in the manner by which he came y such a sight money though to be sure i never imagined that the business was so bad as it proves to to be sister proves to be indeed let me remind you that have proved nothing though god knows you have asserted enough to every hair on my head stand on end and as to his fortune i make doubt that everard can give as satisfactory an account of his it as the honestest man within the bills of should be glad to know then why he so obstinately refuses to any account at all above a year since he returned from the indies and yet there a human being a bit better informed on subject than we were on the first day of his landing though not for want of asking for many and many a good hour have passed in pumping and pumping and yet here do i sit at this moment whit the wiser he always puts on such a solemn look and takes first opportunity of turning the conversation to something else the other day when i be fobbed off with a story about heaven knows what and put the question home to him in many words by what means did you everard brooke get so money he turned his back plump upon me and stalked out of the which was no great proof of his say but upon us what the gentleman values himself for it was but last friday that he bounced out of the room to towser off who was barking at a little dirty beggarboy though he that i had dropped my teaspoon and was obliged to stoop for it a great bear but indeed i expected nothing better from a man who lived so long among sister i dare say that he ought to have stopped to pick up teaspoon though to be sure i find in my heart to blame him much for having gone first to rescue the beggar boy being afraid i should have committed exactly the same fault myself but you know never pretended to and in all matters of sister milman i must give way to your better judgement and however i cannot be equally submissive respecting the material and in spite of all that you have advanced i must still maintain opinion that everard came by his money honestly whatever you may heard to the why he let a body know how he came by it let me tell brother that when a man has anything good to tell of himself he so fond of holding his tongue nay for that matter to hold tongue at all natural and i warrant you whoever does so has good reason at bottom for submitting to such a disagreeable if one could but get him to own it and so think the williamsons the joneses and my cousin dickins and all the family of the for i am not of so uncommunicative a temper as your darling heaven be praised for it no if i get a bit of information i am generous to keep it to myself and have no peace till all neighbours are as well informed as i am so this morning i no got possession of this bloody story than i ordered my chariot drove round the village to communicate it to all our friends relations to be sure they were mightily shocked at the account who be but they confessed that they always expected to something wrong at the bottom of this mystery and they think it mercy that i should have discovered the truth before things were too far between everard and your daughter so you have been carrying this fine story all round the village protest now sister jane it seems to me that you have been yourself a great deal of very unnecessary trouble and if after your assertions should prove to be unfounded i know not recompence you can make poor everard for this attempt to blast character the most innocent circumstances may be so construed as wear an awkward appearance there are always enough in the world ready to spread about scandalous reports and everard too much merit not to have excited plenty of enemies and here you just now picked up a strange unaccountable rigmarole tale from one these and one of his exclaimed mrs milman fanning violently fine truly when i heard the whole story with ears of mine from the mouth of his own little coffee barbarian yes to be sure mirza is a violent enemy of mr that cannot be the old face underwent a considerable change at these last sentences he looked distressed and rubbed his forehead some moments in evident he repeated after a pause jane recollect this is no trifling matter are you quite sure that mirza asserts truth of the story which i have just heard you tell you brother for the second time that i heard him tell with my own ears not indeed all at once for the wicked little knew too well how little it was to his credit that the should get abroad ah he is a cunning hand i promise you but i round about and round about and wormed and wormed and kept the bush till i got it all out of him i confess i was obliged promise faithfully that his master should never know a syllable it for he said that it would give him pain to hear it mentioned as be sure well it may but when i found what a horrible secret it was had a great deal too much conscience to keep my promise and lost time in making the guilt known to the whole well sister i pretend to say that you did wrong and doubt not you acted from the best motives but yet i help that you had acted otherwise this everard poor dear wicked he was once so good so affectionate i would have betted all i in the world that it in his nature to kill so much as a and to murder a woman a woman too that he had promised to and to murder her in such a shocking manner too first to at her from behind a hedge and when he found the poor creature only wounded to have the heart to run up to her and actually beat brains out with a club why mirza said that he verily believed she was above half an hour never heard of anything so what is worst he contented with destroying the poor body he had previously ruined her precious soul it seems that name was nancy an irish family i suppose i once knew irish officer of that name myself i was but a girl then and with him at the hackney assembly and a mighty genteel man he was though he had but one eye but neither here there well as i was telling you this nancy was either the or the wife of a rich planter with whom everard lived as clerk factor or something of that kind well and so this poor girl fell love with everard and he on his side was wonderfully attentive nancy for mirza says that he passed whole days and nights in her and ogling her so that she actually could hardly stir without knowing it till at last he worked himself so totally into her graces and got such an influence over her mind that knowing patron to have made a will entirely in favour he persuaded to poison poor mr in order that she might share his with her abominable her father father or her husband for as i said before i am not which but i should rather suppose it was her father for it seems poor deceived old man made it his dying request to her that she make everard her husband as soon as ever the funeral was over so may judge how artfully the hypocrite must have played his cards now it was supposed that everard would immediately have made nancy brooke the settlements were all drawn up the clothes were bought wedding day was fixed when lo and behold what do you think ungrateful monster did he persuaded the poor young creature to of all her property and when it was converted into money and and such like he enticed her into a wood where he robbed and her in the manner which you have just heard and then getting on a vessel with his plunder in all haste he managed to escape ceylon before the officers of justice had time to discover what become of him the only thing which surprises me is that he have brought away mirza with him but as the young heathen was quite a child i suppose his master thought it probable that he nothing of this bloody business or would certainly forget it the voyage and now brother what have you to say in behalf of fine mr everard ah how often have i told you over and over again was certain that something bad would come out against him all in time but you were obstinate you still let him come dangling your house and keep hankering and hankering after your daughter and now you may think yourself well off if the heart upon having the vagabond and getting her brains knocked out in turn like poor miss nancy partial as the old man was to everard he could not but feel his in him a good deal shaken by this long string of circumstances and by the positive manner in which they were and now flocked in one after another the joneses and the and all the family of the burnabys with their wondering and blessing themselves and their exclamations and their pity for miss and their having long suspected nothing better the old man listened in silence and sighed while they assailed him on all sides but though he could not venture to contradict them could not find it in his heart to join in their censures of the whom he had so long esteemed and whom he still loved so tenderly when at length cousin dickins made his appearance a man of importance in this family for he was rich a bachelor advanced in and godfather and announced his thorough belief in story it was no longer in old power to neutral in the business he declared his submission to cousin better judgement and his intention of declining any communication with mr brooke for he no longer dared to call him by familiar and affectionate appellation of this declaration was received with great satisfaction by all and the resolution was pronounced nem con to be extremely the delinquent was at this time in london whither he had repaired it was suspected for the purpose of ascertaining the exact state his property in order that on his return he might lay it elmwood accompanied by a formal demand of his hand absence was thought very fortunate by the company as it afforded best opportunity for putting jessy upon her guard and it determined to summon her without loss of time make known to her true character of the man with whom she had so imprudently suffered to associate and insist upon her a solemn promise in convocation that she would from that moment give up all with jessy made her appearance alas the fate of heart had been decided as she listened to the strange tale she sometimes with indignation against the accusers and then again her cheeks pale through fear lest the accusation should prove well founded charge was concluded the promise was demanded yet still jessy not but sat absorbed in terror and grief in vain was her repeated in vain was she called upon to declare her abhorrence at still jessy only answered with her tears her friendly relations up the white of their eyes at her blindness and delusion mrs was loud in exclaiming against the obstinacy and young people who would fancy themselves wiser than their parents the formidable cousin dickins assuming one of his most severe dignified looks insisted upon her giving an immediate terrified almost out of her senses at this formal address trembling jessy now contrived to sob out a hope that her aunt had mistaken that everard would still be able to prove his innocence so impossible a supposition was of itself sufficient set the whole assembly in an uproar the williamsons the cousin dickins and all the family of the burnabys gave tongue once and above a dozen voices were still busy in affixing the flattering epithets possible to the name of everard when the opened and everard himself stood before them he was just from london and had hastened to assure himself of welfare the next moment you might have heard a pin drop the debate had carried on in too loud a tone to permit his being ignorant of nature of their disclosure but at all events the evident universal embarrassment which his presence created left him no that himself had been brought upon the carpet and that in a manner no means to his credit his sunburnt cheek glowed with indignation he gazed round the circle and requested to know the meaning of appellations by which while ascending the stairs be had heard the question being general no person thought it necessary to take to himself each looked towards his neighbour as if he expected answer to come from thence and consequently all continued everard now found it needful to particularize and turning to dickins whose voice had been super eminently loud he demanded of the desired really stammered out cousin dickins adjusting neckcloth in order to conceal his embarrassment mr as to what was said i can only say that i said nothing is to say not that i quite said nothing though to say truth was almost as good as nothing for it was nothing from my knowledge i only repeated i only observed that if what milman said was true interrupted everard enough now then we get step nearer to the source of the business will you then madam the goodness to explain your reason for applying such epithets to the name of everard brooke a name which i am bold to deserves them as little as that of any person in this society i for your reply sir and by my faith you shall have it answered mrs milman by this time had recovered her mind and was now resolved to carry business through with flying colours by assuming a double quantity assurance shall have it never fear and if it turns out your name is really as good as any in the company and that really did not poison the old gentleman and beat miss out why then so much the better for you all and harm the old gentleman beat out miss brains what nancy what old gentleman why in the name of heaven mrs where did you pick up this farrago of pick up indeed let me tell you sir that i never picked anything or anybody in my life and that if you talk of picking you are the much more likely person to pick up of the two and now about it let you into another piece of my mind rude in you to call my conversation a farrago of nonsense but no wonder for not the first lady that you have treated rudeness heaven knows and the pity nancy for nancy exclaimed everard who the devil then is then you know miss nancy no never heard of miss i madam i never come now that is a good one to beat a brain out then to cut her acquaintance and pretend you know nothing about is the finest piece of modern good breeding that i ever heard of indeed i never expected much good breeding from you sir ever that affair of the teaspoon but one thing i can tell you your hottentot mirza sings a very different song from on this occasion for i had the whole story from his own not mighty polite in you to contradict one so plump sir but matter for that i repeat it mirza told me himself that you poisoned a gentleman and beat his brains out and now much for that and butter to fish nay if you choose to me call the boy hither and ask him i desire no better and i see playing in the garden at this it shall be done cried everard at the same throwing up the window mirza was soon in the mirza what is the meaning began everard but mrs immediately interrupted if you please sir examine the boy myself come mirza well and how do my dear pray mirza what was pretty story you told me this morning about poisoning somebody killing somebody with a club and missy cried mirza no say dat massa tell me no massa grieve massa no child not he angry he wants to hear how prettily tell the story and so you must tell it all he mr everard gave a sign of assent know mirza it was all about your master made his fortune well and so mirza upon my a very nice lad and for you well and you say mirza and so you say my dear that your master killed her a wood what did he kill her quite she quite dead massa beat brains out wid great mirza exclaimed everard dad you did massa and god him bless you for him for whispered mrs milman to cousin dickins fine morality the wicked little heathen but hear then turning again to the boy but mirza you me something too about poisoning what i suppose before your killed miss anne interrupted the was repeated mrs milman well connor or the name makes no great difference well mirza and so you say this anne instigated by your master i my massa my shrieked mirra in a tone of agony at the time pointing to everard who pale as death and with a expressing the most painful agitation rushed to a table on which a decanter of water of which he hastily swallowed a draught though violently did his hands shake that the goblet was carried to his with my leaving you so said he in a faltering voice will return in a few and he hastily quitted the followed by now then his guilt a pat doubting mrs milman spread out petticoats fanned herself with an air of triumph and began a upon the wonderful effects of conscience surprise had checked course of tears the blood had deserted her lips and and she sat motionless looking like a marble statue the good elmwood felt in his wound which his heart had just but he had nothing to offer for her relief except a fond pressure her hand and a sigh of compassion the rest of the company shrugged their shoulders at the depravity of human nature and nodded heads significantly at one another as if they had been so many josses suddenly the door opened and mrs milman was still in the flow of her eloquence when everard the room to appearances perfectly recovered from his late said he am now master of the whole of this your ignorance of circumstances peculiar to the east the of my adventures and the broken english in which you heard related have led you to a most extraordinary mistake i cannot it up without subjecting myself to the most agonising and rending open afresh those wounds which true are over but which are too deep and too deadly to be ever healed if therefore the opinion of the world were alone that opinion which is so little necessary to my own happiness i leave you in your error rather than subject myself to the pain of explanation but i see in this circle two persons one of possesses too dear an interest in my affections to permit my leaving single thorn in her gentle bosom which i have it in my power to while the paternal kindness which the other showed to me while i still a boy demands that i should convince him that it was not to one unworthy to calm their feelings i will sacrifice my own much as i shall suffer while making the recital the recital of adventures shall still be made be attentive then and shall be curiosity now became the predominant expression elmwood freer held up his head higher than before and shook his hand affectionately a roseate blush stole over the lovely fair of jessy while a look of silent gratitude thanked her father the of the company drew their chairs closer together and prepared listen with all their everard seated himself and thus you are already aware that my fortune was made in the island of it was there that i was so lucky as to find employment in the house a man whose virtues rendered him as much the object of esteem as the favours which he conferred upon me entitled him to peculiar gratitude i was engaged by him as his secretary but other names were soon forgotten by us both in that of friends he an englishman as well as myself and perhaps this had no influence in producing so strict an intimacy between us a variety untoward circumstances had compelled him to abandon his native and sail in pursuit of fortune to the east his toil had not been the capricious goddess who fled from him with such disdain in now showered her favours upon his head with the most profusion he had consumed but a few years in ceylon and was rich and possessed of a distinguished situation it seemed as if was at length resolved to convince the world that she was not blind for had she searched the whole island through she would found it difficult to bestow wealth and honour upon a wiser or a man but of all his treasures that which he counted most precious for which he thanked bounty at every moment of his and with every pulsation of his heart was a wife who united all beauty and graces of her sex with all the firmness and judgement ours one only blessing was denied them louisa was not a my friend and patron his name was seafield possessed a villa at small distance from columbo the place true was of no extent but it united in their fullest perfection all those which render nature in that climate so irresistible an this was most beloved residence and hither he whenever the duties of his station permitted his absenting himself a few days from colombo in particular there was a small pavilion designed by his own hand and raised under his own to which he was particularly partial and in which he was accustomed pass the greatest portion of his time it stood some few hundred from the dwelling house and was situated on a small eminence the prospect over land and sea was of a description rich varied extensive around it towered a thick circle of palm trees resembling colonnade their leafy fans formed a second cupola above the roof while they prevented a single from piercing through coolness of their embowering shades their tall and slender permitted not the eye to lose one of the innumerable charms afforded the surrounding this delightful spot happened to be the residence of family when accidental business of importance required presence at columbo conscious that her husband considered everyday lost which he was compelled to pass at a distance from his retreat she positively refused his attendance but accepting me as escort she departed for the city diligence and impatience to home enabled her to dispatch her affairs in less time than she expected them to occupy and in the very first moment that she herself once more at liberty she ordered the palanquins to prepared and her slaves to hold themselves in readiness for our journey was performed by night for the double purpose of home the sooner and of escaping the ardour of the noonday sun arrived an hour after daybreak yet seafield was already usual he ascended the hill to enjoy the beauty of the thus said zadi old and attached domestic in whose his master made an exception to his general opinion that in all transactions with europeans the natives of this island were devoid of gratitude honesty and good shall find him in the pavilion an hour ago i left him was the will go thither and surprise she said addressing herself me here while i change my dress a few moments will suffice my toilet and i shall expect to find you here when i in the meantime i remained leaning against one of the columns supported the small portico by which the door was sheltered from i enjoyed an uninterrupted view of the hill and its pavilion surrounded by its light and beautiful garland of palm trees the sight irresistibly while my eye dwelt with satisfaction on broad sheltering heads i fancied that i could discover a excrescence upon the stem of one of them extremely unusual in trees which in general rear themselves perpendicularly towards sky regular and straight as the pillars of a colonnade it resembled large branch extending from one stem to its neighbour and puzzled me more in this appearance was that it seemed occasionally be waved backwards and forwards though the breathing of the was so gentle that it scarcely moved the leaves on the branches i made a variety of guesses to account or this but every thing which my memory or my imagination could seemed inadequate to solve this difficulty entirely to my i was still puzzling myself with conjectures when zadi drew near with some slight refreshments i pointed to the branch whose motion had excited so much of my attention and inquired whether could at all account for the strong effect produced upon it by while the lighter boughs were so gently agitated immediately turned himself towards the palm trees but no sooner his eye rest upon the spot in question than the silver basket with contents dropped from his hands the paleness of death spread over his swarthy countenance he caught at one of the columns to himself from falling on the ground and while his eyes expressed deepest horror and consternation he pronounced with difficulty anaconda that is the anaconda we are what could have produced an effect so sudden and so violent upon a whom i well knew to inherit from nature the most determined courage most remarkable was to me absolutely but though i was ignorant of its cause the sight of his extreme was almost sufficient to shake my own presence of mind i saw that was on the point of sinking on the earth overpowered by his i sprang towards him and caught him in my the love of i exclaimed compose yourself old man me what terrifies you thus what mean you by the anaconda what occasion these complaints and this he endeavoured to recover himself he strove to speak but in and before i could understand the accents of his stammering louisa joined us and without observing the agitation put arm within mine and advanced towards the pavilion this action to restore to zadi the lost powers of his body and mind with a cry he threw himself on his knees before us and in words by sobs and accompanied by tears he forbade our crossing first step without these he exclaimed inevitable destruction every door must be bolted every window must barred this mansion must resemble a sepulchre where nothing living to be and while he spoke he hastily closed and locked folding doors through which we had a prospect of the pavilion observed his singular behaviour and the agitation of his with looks which expressed the most lively you distracted she asked after a few moments these tears and these expressions so alarming and why do you our going to your going to almighty god my master he is yonder oh is lost he lost beyond the power of is lost say you answer me old man what mean you what fear oh how my heart beats with her frame trembled with anxiety while she gazed with eyes upon the messenger of evil tidings and pressed my hand with convulsive yourself my good said i is this which you speak of with such terror i have seen nothing except branch of a palm tree which the wind moved backwards and singularly enough true but still nothing in it repeated the indian wringing his hands the lord have mercy on me miserable old man ah mr everard branch of the palm tree alas alas it is no branch it is a snake terrible snake we call it an anaconda and its kind is in size the enormous in nature the most fierce and in appetite the most of any to be found through all ceylon see he approaching one of the windows how the monster plays among branches it always twines and twists itself into those folds knots and circles when it prepares to dart itself upon the like lightning to seize its prey oh my master my poor dear he never can escape nothing can save half of this alarming explanation was more than enough to throw wretched louisa into a state of distraction her features were distorted by terror that she was scarcely to be known for the woman her eyes stretched almost to breaking and her hands together with as strong a grasp as if she meant them never to be separated she exclaimed in a voice so hollow and so expressive suffocation that it pierced her hearers to the very heart my beloved oh help me to save him good good men forsake not oh forsake him but at this moment the wife required assistance not less than husband overpowered by her sensations she fainted in my arms flew to summon her female attendants and i bore the pale louisa back to her own apartment though dreadful narrative almost deprived me of animation our endeavours to the extinguished flame of life were length successful her eyes opened she cast around her a look why are you still said she to me in a feeble voice life then of so little consequence fly to his succour rescue him let me die in preserving him you will preserve me if he perishes am lives he lives heaven be thus shouted the zadi as he rushed into apartment his anxious vigilance induced him to examine every part of the mansion and ascertain his own eyes that it was perfectly secure against danger he returned out of breath from the balcony whence he had discovered his great satisfaction that his view was unimpeded over the pavilion he remarked that the door and all the windows as far as power of vision extended were closely fastened and hence he reasonably concluded that his master had been aware of the approach in full time to take every precaution for his you that my dear i exclaimed while i took this intelligence is a one sufficient to restore your and tranquility we had nothing apprehend for seafield except being surprised by the monster while unprepared but you see that has had time to shut out the danger he has now nothing to do but remain quietly within his retreat and the snake will either discover his being so near or at any rate will be able to through the bulwarks which separate them the whole business is a disagreeable blockade for an hour or perhaps less at the end which the anaconda will grow weary of waiting for its prey and retiring to seek it in some other quarter will release our friend then we shall be quit for the the satisfaction with which i thus endeavoured to reassure the heart of louisa was thoroughly established in my own but zadi own feelings were too much agitated by his situation to his attending to those of others hastened with too consideration to destroy the hope which i so fondly indulged and which i strove to soothe the afflicted wife no no exclaimed must not reckon upon the snake leaving us so soon the anaconda has once chosen a group of trees for her abode and seen to sport among their branches in the manner in which we saw amusing herself she will remain there for whole days and watching patiently for her prey till every chance of success her and absolute famine compels her to emigrate but her capacity existing without food is almost inconceivable and till she removes her own free will no human power is able to drive her from stammered out the trembling louisa he is indeed even should those slight barriers be sufficient to protect from the fury he must still at last fall a prey to assaults of my frowning looks easily made the old man aware of the imprudence he had just committed but the mischief was irreparable every which his imagination could suggest to soften the effect produced his confession was unable to blunt the arrow which carried with it into the heart of his mistress the poison of after all said i are we to take it for granted that friend is actually exposed to this urgent danger by your own zadi above an hour had elapsed between your leaving your master in pavilion and your discovery of the anaconda and what then can be likely than the day being so delightful he should have gone out walk and have quitted the pavilion before the of exclaimed louisa while she seized my hand pressed it to her lips ever blessed be you for suggestion why should it not be as you suppose why should not absence have rescued dear sighed the old man and shook his head closed the windows all fastened i interrupted him did seafield ever leave favourite retreat without taking those precautions perhaps at very moment that we are trembling for his safety he is at the of miles from the place of danger perhaps nothing more is for his full security than that we should take the precaution warning him in time lest he should return to the dangerous instead of coming straight to the house come come zadi let hasten to find him summon together all the male domestics as well our let us divide them into small parties and them into every path by which it is possible for seafield to the hasten hasten cried louisa thought that you may come late pierces me to the very soul yet on his having already the pavilion hangs my whole my only hope hasten friends oh to find her eagerness would not suffer us to remain a moment we consigned to the care of her female attendants we then collected the inhabitants of the house together with all speed and having armed in the best manner that time would permit we approached in quarters as near the fatal hill as the protecting shelter of the and branches would allow us without running the risk of discovered by the anaconda zadi remained with on our way i endeavoured to compose my thoughts and to make master of every particular respecting the danger to which the of my heart was exposed my own alarm and presence hitherto prevented my obtaining a thorough knowledge of the nature situation and what he had to apprehend but now that i alone with him i lost no time before i questioned see old said i your fatal outcry an anaconda palsied every soul through excess of terror now your imprudence have been most unpardonable should it turn out that you spoke being quite certain of the fact or if you should be found through own natural timidity to have exaggerated the danger yourself therefore and then answer me calmly and frankly are positive that what you saw was really an anaconda and in the account which you have just given of her have you not in some overstepped the limits of answered the good old man it were the last word which have to utter in this world i should still repeat my assertions why the very name of this creature is enough to make native of this island feel the blood freeze in his veins and that have not deceived myself is alas but too certain i have seen the anaconda twice at no greater distance than now though one of such a monstrous length and thickness as that which is present before us this country would speedily become a wilderness fortunately these reptiles were not very rarely met with for general they remain concealed within the recesses of the deepest there clinging round the branches of some gigantic tree they waiting with inexhaustible patience for an opportunity of darting upon their prey the first man or animal who is unlucky enough to beneath them how it happens that this snake should have advanced far into the open country is what i can least comprehend but as rainy season is but just over it is most probable that she has swept away by the irresistible violence of some of during this conversation we had continued to advance under favour the underwood till we were scarcely more than a paces distant from the monster we could now examine it with the perfect distinctness and the eye was able to take in at once the extent of its gigantic structure it was a sight calculated to in equal degrees our horror and our admiration it united the singular and brilliant beauty with everything that could impress beholder with apprehension and though while gazing upon it i that every limb shuddered involuntarily i was still compelled to that never had i witnessed an exhibition more fascinating or gratifying to the the anaconda was still employed in twisting itself in a thousand among the with such restless activity with rapidity inconceivable that it was frequently impossible for the sight follow her movements at one moment she fastened herself by the end her tail to the very summit of the loftiest tree and stretched out her whole length swung and forwards like the pendulum of clock that her head almost seemed to graze the earth beneath then in another before the eye was aware of her intention she disappeared among the leafy canopies now she slid down the winding herself round and round it and now again only the extremity her tail remained twisted round the root while she stretched out body upon the grass and with elevated head and described a large or a small circle as her capricious these latter movements gave us an opportunity to discriminate with exactness during a few seconds at a time the singular richness beauty of her tints the long slender body was covered with a of glittering scales girdling it round with rings above rings effectually securing it against every attack the head was of yellowish green and marked in the middle of the skull with a dark spot from whence small stripes of pale yellow were drawn down the jaws a broad circle of the same colour went round the throat a necklace on either side of which were two patches shape resembling shields along the back ran a chain of black with edges from whence on both sides rings and broad bands of the brightest alternately and in the most regular order descended in zigzag towards the stomach where they lost imperceptibly but what served more than all to dazzle the eye with brilliance of variegated colouring were innumerable spots of a and vivid sprinkled without order over the surface of the upper skin for with the slightest movement these points and spots and contrasts of variegated hues together in the sunbeams and formed one universal blaze composed all the colours of the rainbow much as i admired the splendour of garment not less did i wonder at the enormous thickness of terrific creature which did not yield in bulk to that of a man moderate size yet by comparing its thickness with its length zadi decidedly of opinion that the anaconda must have been greatly by a fast of unusually long duration but the tranquillity of observations was suddenly disturbed by perceiving that she abruptly from her airy gambols and remained motionless at the foot the with her head elevated and turned towards the as if in the act of at that moment oh god with what violence did my heart beat my bosom if as from every circumstance appeared but too probable friend was really shut up within the pavilion it was beyond a that the monster had discovered his being so near her and was now the point of making a serious attack we could see distinctly the of her hideous head and the flames of her great piercing reflected from the glass windows whose shutters had been closed within but the sight of her own terrors seemed to scare even the herself for she instantly recoiled and then laying herself down to the threshold of the circular pavilion she encompassed it as if she was determined to secure her destined victim irrevocably enclosing him within the impassable limits of her magic ring penetrated with the sense of that danger by which my friend was i forgot my own and seizing my gun placed it to my shoulder the whistled through the air i was an excellent marksman and was that i had pointed my piece exactly at the head and whether too great anxiety made my hand shake or that the animal at very moment made some slight change in her attitude i know not but is at least certain that not the slightest shrinking gave me reason believe that she felt herself at all injured in the meanwhile had seized my arm and drawn me forcibly deeper part of the mr sighed he was well aware that the anaconda set all our firearms at defiance her scaly hide renders invulnerable except when one is quite dose to her and all that have done is to put your own safety in danger without advancing single step nearer to my however it did not appear that our enemy had paid much attention to assault upon her on the contrary she only busied herself in her attempts to gain an entrance through the windows at length seemingly wearied with her unavailing efforts she slowly and concealed herself under the verdant umbrella of the trees we also had discovered her former lurking place though we now more irresolute than ever as to the means most proper to adopted towards the rescue of my while we stood thus with our eyes fixed immovably upon the pavilion observed the door to be slightly agitated after a minute the lock gently drawn back slowly and with the utmost caution did the expand about the breadth of half a foot and out sprang the psyche a beautiful italian greyhound favourite play and inseparable companion as if conscious of her danger she down the hill with her utmost swiftness but with still swiftness did the anaconda in one monstrous spring dart rattling from its airy covert the poor little animal was seized we could hear a short cry which marked its dying agony for dreadful jawbone moved but twice or thrice and lo the was broken and every bone in its body splintered the snake dragged her prey to the foot of the for in order to the proper exertion of strength it seemed necessary for her to the stem or strong branch of some tree to cling to where stretched herself out upon the grass at her ease and began with black tongue to separate the flesh from the bones of the crushed the distress occasioned in my mind by this sight in itself so and disgusting was converted into agony by the reflections to which gave birth after the first moments of horror and surprise were that fact was now confirmed which till this moment in order preserve at least a gleam of comfort however faint i had refused to believe seafield then was actually in the pavilion discharge of my musket had in all probability made him aware that friends were at no great distance no one but he could have the door so cautiously in order to leave his little favourite liberty to quit their common shelter and zadi was positive that had observed a riband fastened round the neck of the animal to something white appeared to be attached in form resembling a it was then a message to us a cry for assistance a sacred that we should not abandon him in this season of his utmost need agony of soul must he have endured what agony of soul must he even that moment be enduring to what a pitch of desperation must his have been worked up before his trembling hand could have resolved draw back the bolt which was the only barrier between himself annihilation how bitter a pang must it have given his benevolent heart when he drove out his fond and faithful and exposed her to such danger and then flattering himself as doubt he did that the little speed would surely enable her escape oh what a cruel wound must expiring have given to his feelings these reflections or at least nearly similar to them almost deprived poor zadi of his powers of mercy he exclaimed repeatedly did his mean to tell us that at this moment he is struggling with alas alas we know it we feel it and yet here we stand without counsel without resolution without patience said i interrupting him is evident our waiting here is of no advantage let us return home and to find means of giving some more effectual assistance than our we found the domestics returned from their unavailing expedition the greatest part of them assembled in the courtyard whose lofty afforded them a secure refuge being all natives of ceylon they well acquainted with the nature and pursuits of the anaconda from their own experience or from hearsay but almost deprived of power of thought by their terrors no one was able to point out means for attacking her with success i immediately despatched two them to columbo to explain our situation and demand assistance also desired that medical aid might be sent to louisa and that they could possibly find one they should bring back with them speaking trumpet i then repaired to poor louisa and endeavoured comfort her heart with a faint gleam of hope which my own incapable of admitting i failed in the attempt she was a prey to most abject despair nor was i more successful in my endeavours persuade her to withdraw from this scene of horror and accompany messengers to columbo a measure which was advisable both on account her own security and because her absence would leave us at liberty bestow our undivided attention upon her husband but finding resolved not to remove from the scene of danger i to the courtyard where the dejected domestics were still over the situation of their master and expatiating on the properties of the i exclaimed is not one among us all to whom master of this house has not been a benefactor now that he threatened with destruction now is the time for us to show gratitude for his kindness come then let every one follow me loves his lord and who bears an honest heart in his bosom let despise the danger of the attack and set forward in a full body deliver him by force we are armed in numbers in reflection skill the advantage is on our side the bolder that we rush upon enemy the less dreadful will she appear to us my life for it will be alarmed at the attack will fly before us and thus we enjoy the inestimable pleasure of rescuing our friend from death then let all who are of my opinion show themselves to be men range themselves on this side of the alas zadi was the only one who obeyed this invitation the rest timid wretches in number between twenty and thirty stood trembling gazing upon each other with doubtful looks and together as if desirous of discovering an excuse for the cowardice each in the ignominy of his neighbour after a few minutes one them whom the rest had appointed to be spokesman advanced towards and stammered out their general assurance that to attack the snake with force would be nothing better than absolute this hope disappointed i next resolved to try what effect of might be produced upon the monster by the united shouts and outcries so considerable a body assisted by the general and repeated of our our preparations were soon made louisa was of the clamour which was going to be made and in truth we raised uproar so loud and so well sustained that it seemed almost capable waking the sleepers in the grave prom all the casements we at the same moment our muskets provided with a double charge and hail of bullets rattled about the head of the gigantic snake afforded us a fair aim yet still she continued to play her quietly among the trees nay she did not give any sign by which could judge that she was sensible of our attack after a few spent in this manner with no better effect we found that our of ammunition was exhausted besides we were ourselves too fatigued to continue any longer an attempt which afforded us so prospect of producing any by this time the day was drawing rapidly to its close by dint turning the painful subject frequently in my mind and making possible conjecture one means of scaring the anaconda had itself which appeared to me well worthy of attention but in order put it in execution the darkness of the night was necessary i often read in books of travels what powerful aid had been derived fire against the attacks of wild beasts and how lions and tigers often forgotten their thirst of blood and betaken themselves flight like the most timid animals when scared by a whirled round or the blaze of a flaming heap of straw armed with weapons i was determined as soon as night should be set in approach the anaconda and put her courage to the proof even the faithful zadi should be the only one of sufficient courage assist me in my venturous the night arrived an awful stillness reigned all around us our however still was watchful for from time to time we could hear rustling among the branches i passed the twilight in endeavouring comfort louisa with the prospect of a serious attack to be made the snake the next day from which as i assured her much success might be expected but i judged it prudent to conceal from our nightly enterprise the effect of which appeared even to myself uncertain to make me venture to ground upon it any promise advantage besides her exhausted strength made it necessary that she should pass some moments in tranquillity a which seemed to me absolutely incompatible with the tumults expectation which the knowledge of our proposed adventure naturally excite in her at length a sign given by zadi made me aware that all our were completed louisa was reclining on a couch with her eyes and seemed to have fallen into a kind of lethargy i stole softly the apartment and was on the point of quitting the house when a suggested itself to me of communicating my design to my friend before the arrival of the speaking trumpet which i expected the day from columbo i recollected that i had lately taught seafield common european trick of combination by which two persons from each other having first agreed upon their measures could their sentiments without the help of words a certain number of corresponding with the number of the place which each letter of four and twenty holds in the alphabet enabled the striker to words and sentences by which the hearer without other was made aware of the steps which without his knowledge it had settled for him to take this trifle had but lately served us to louisa and pass away an idle evening hour and i flattered myself the possibility that it might still exist in at any rate i resolved to make the trial without loss of time and stillness of the night seemed to afford me the most opportunity for executing my plan with a thin smooth board well calculated for reverberating sounds and strong hammer were easily procured with these i hastened to balcony and began by striking as many blows as the alphabet that is one to a two to b to z c till i had through it regularly i trusted that this orderly manner of would awaken his attention and having completed the alphabet i him in the same manner if he comprehended my meaning to strike blows within the pavilion as loud as he possibly could oh powers i had not long to wait it was not long before three sounds informed me that i was understood and never did music seem sweet to my ear i hurried to tell louisa that i had found a means communicating with her husband and that i was going to command him be of good cheer in her name and for her sake a silent smile a convulsive pressure of my hand were my reward and i hastened again to the balcony to assure the poor prisoner that i labouring for his relief that louisa was well and begged him to patient and composed and that i requested him to keep up his and resist the attacks of despair since he might depend upon it i would rescue him or perish in the attempt i concluded by him to assure me that he would confide in the activity of friendship by repeating his former signal i now suffered my hammer rest i listened again more audibly than before did i hear three blows given from within the pavilion and i hastened to prosecute my nightly plan with fresh spirits and excited by remonstrances about a dozen of the bravest among domestics and were assembled with torches in hands in the courtyard my design was to steal as near the hill as underwood would permit under favour of the darkness and only by a single dark lanthorn when we could approach no further hazard we were to light our torches as fast as possible and them round and round to rush towards the pavilion with loud shouts order that our attack might be accompanied by all the terrors advantage of zadi to whose care the guiding lanthorn was confided went foremost followed close upon his footsteps and thus with extreme caution and profound silence did we press through bushes and brambles till arrived above half as near again to the pavilion as the position we had occupied during the day the anaconda now lay right before quiet and unsuspecting nor could we have wished for a opportunity for executing our plan with every probability of we now turned to our companions but just heaven who can our astonishment and vexation and how did our heart sicken perceiving that the faithless cowards had shrunk from the danger that it was so near at hand and had profited by the darkness to away one by one i was alone with zadi we concluded with justice for only two persons to make the attempt must be unavailing and old man flattered himself that he should be able to shame his into a resumption of their more manly resolutions i had but hopes of his success yet no choice was left me but to follow him endeavour to give double strength to his persuasions and both were employed in vain their terrors had subdued all sense shame completely they called us madmen for wishing to expose to the fury of the famished anaconda and instead of promising future assistance they declared that they would only wait daybreak to secure themselves by flight from a danger so imminent the meanwhile zadi was busy in fastening several torches together sir he cried to me us lose no more precious time endeavouring to inspire these heartless knaves with courage let leave the cowards and try whether perhaps the glare of these doubled as you see them may not of themselves be sufficient to and scare away the monster at the worst we can but perish with dear master and it is better to die than not perform our duty i obeyed him we hastened back to the pavilion already were we on point of ascending the hill when i felt my arm seized by someone a convulsive grasp i turned hastily round a thin figure through speed and anxiety and whose white garments fluttered in breeze of night stood beside me it was louisa our dispute with slaves had not passed so quietly but that our voices had reached ear of sorrowing wife whose sore anguish of heart not slumber to approach she questioned her attendants by interrogatories she contrived to draw from them the peculiar nature the enterprise on which we were engaged she feigned to sleep and soon as her women were thrown off their guard she stole from apartment seized a torch and followed us determined to share with the danger and its my whole resolution failed me when i recognized the when she made known in a few short expressive words her resolution in a low voice i conjured her to return to i protested that her presence robbed our arms strength and our hearts of courage and i asked her whether it was enough agony for us to tremble for an existence so dear as without being obliged to risk the loss of another life life for was the only reply which she gave to remonstrances life for his what shall i rest my hands before me while strangers are active in his defence shall i have blame myself during the remnant of my existence for having done for him in the time of his extreme need nothing shall my actually be rescued by his friends while his careless wife has even attempted to preserve him no everard no my life for his life for i listened with admiration to the overflowings of this noble heart to resist her vehemence i knew not i was compelled to give way to and yet was conscious that her presence must entirely destroy chance of our success it would have been madness to venture in company to that extreme point of danger to which zadi and myself before not scrupled to advance the anaconda too appeared at moment to be more restless than formerly doubtless the sound of footsteps and our whispering dispute must already have betrayed being in the neighbourhood nevertheless we hastily kindled one of which we held in each hand and as we whirled rapidly backwards and forwards we went forth shouts and shrieks all our strength the dead stillness of all around us rendered outcries doubly a rushing sound among the tops of the as if branch branch they were forcibly snapped asunder was the answer given to challenge it was the anaconda whether excited by fear or by anger will not pretend to decide who darted herself from tree to tree tremendous leaps while the slender stems were bent and shaken by burthen at the same time we were alarmed by a loud hissing piercingly sharp that it seemed close at our ears and her blazing with their own vindictive fires shot lightnings through gloom of in truth this appearance was in every respect so dreadful that required no ordinary courage to witness it without agitation i deny that while gazing on it i felt my hair stand on end and my run cold and i observed that zadi strove to keep his teeth together in order to prevent me from hearing them chatter i with apprehension to louisa alas there lay the wretched wife on earth deprived of consciousness this sight was sufficient to every other consideration i threw away my torches hastily clasped unfortunate in my arms and with help bore her with all back to the prosperous in this alone we then unpursued by the anaconda here after a long interval insensibility we at length succeeded in recalling spirits she revived but it was only to dwell upon the midnight from which we were just returned and which her inflamed painted in colours if possible still more dreadful that the she called without ceasing upon her husband and upon me and since was out of my power to give more active assistance elsewhere it have been barbarous in me to leave her without endeavouring soothing and persuasion to dissipate the gloomy ideas by which heated brain was thus passed away the remainder of the night which left us even less hope and resolution than we possessed when it arrived melancholy morning at length dawned but the sun was scarcely when zadi rushed into the apartment his eyes sparkled and the of his heart almost choked his words before he was able to give mr he exclaimed master my dear master he still hope he has still courage he endeavours to communicate with we shall soon know how matters go with him what he wishes to be what he expects us to do yes yes we will soon know it was some time before he was sufficiently calm to explain to me cause of this emotion at length i learned that in examining pavilion he had just discovered a sheet of paper thrust through crevice of the door and which apparently detained by one of corners fluttered loosely in the air unable to effect its doubtless it was a letter which seafield hoped some favourable gust wind would carry within our reach but which he had not disengaged from its narrow passage as to reading the contents even the distance had permitted it zadi was not possessed of the requisite he therefore had hastened in all diligence to communicate me this discovery from which i also derived some hope though than that which filled the bosom of the faithful we hurried to the hill approached still nearer than we had ventured do hitherto and with the assistance of an excellent telescope endeavoured to decipher the characters traced upon the important alas that there actually were characters traced on it was all that could distinguish for the light paper fluttered continually in wind and was never suffered to rest for two seconds together inexhaustible patience my unwearied exertions long struggled the evident impossibility of success i gained nothing by them the conviction that to prosecute the attempt further would only be throw away a greater portion of my time zadi in breathless and his eyes fixed on my face unalterably watched my every you give up the said he at length while a livid overspread his dark countenance and such a trembling seized him i could see his every limb shaking then there is no more to said let us return to the house and take courage i will fetch the man i exclaimed startling at this unexpected assurance say you your good intention is worthy of your good heart but would make an unavailing sacrifice to your fidelity you may destruction on yourself but you never will bring the paper thence to do that is out of any mortal be so may be so repeated the indian at least the shall be made it seems as if my voice cried to me that safety depended on that paper and should i be worthy to belong to if i were deaf to my cry by the god of my fathers i either come back to you with that paper or never will come and with every word that he spoke his tone became stronger his firmer and the fire of resolution illuminated his large dark during this contention we reached the courtyard in silence absorbed in himself did this unequalled servant make the preparations for his undertaking his plan was to conceal his person from head to foot under a covering of boughs and resembling as much as possible the broken branches with which gambols or indignation had strewn the hill all around under this verdant shield he flattered himself that he should be to creep gradually to the pavilion door unperceived by the have been said he this kind of work from earliest infancy in my time i was reckoned an expert and by means of this artifice have frequently made those animals my but a few minutes were past and already was zadi accoutred in singular disguise he provided himself with no weapons except dagger he obstinately refused to suffer me to accompany him me that i should only put my own life in danger without being able afford him the least assistance he was so positive that i was to give up the point but i was at least determined to accompany fellow with my eyes as well as with my fervent and wishes from the balcony of the i had an and unimpeded view over the surrounding objects and from hence i zadi set forward on his perilous adventure taking through precaution wide circuit in order to reach the hill with equal prudence he made his approach on that side where pavilion would screen him from the observation from time time i lost sight of him among the underwood even when he was my eyes i occasionally doubted whether it was he indeed so and so artfully did he make his approach creeping on his hands knees sometimes remaining without stirring sometimes forwards with a movement so imperceptible that it almost eluded keenness of sight he was a living example to me of the assiduity and skill which the savage employs in laying ambuscades and stealing upon his unsuspecting and now favoured by the long grass and fragments of boughs with the ground was covered had zadi by a thousand serpentine reached the wall of the pavilion my heart beat violently as i saw one side the anaconda as yet it is true suspecting nothing still dreadful from her appearance and exhibiting every moment proofs of her strength by the powerful leaps with which she herself from bough to bough and on the other hand separated from by the distance of ten yards at most i beheld a poor infirm and man whose force consisted only in his courage and his zadi in the mean while remained so tranquil and so motionless in present position near the that the monster could fail of being deceived by so unsuspicious an appearance the eye was fixed immovably upon the snake and followed all her and windings with incessant application while she swung herself unwearied activity backwards and forwards now here now there above now below till at the very moment when she shot herself him in a bound of prodigious extent i suddenly saw the paper disappear from its place without being able to perceive means by which it was brought into the power of the successful i clasped my hands in ecstasy and poured out my thanks to god from very bottom of my heart but all was not yet done it required no caution and dexterity to retire than to proach and never did i up more fervent vows than at the moment when the animated thicket to set itself in motion slower than the of a dial moving forwards now backwards now right now left it stole down the hill still it went on and on and lower and lower with inexpressible delight i saw it almost at the very foot of hill and now at length i began to draw my breath without pain noble fellow is said i to myself at that moment whether joy the successful issue of his attempt had deprived him of part of former caution or whether some accidental derangement of sheltering branches discovered enough to excite the suspicion at that moment i saw the anaconda dart from above and the quickness of thought she reached the bottom of the hill enveloped the unfortunate in her folds a piercing shriek of burst from me i felt all my blood conceal itself within my yet even in this dreadful situation wonderful was the presence of which zadi still preserved wonderful was the courage the and the skill with which he defended himself against the grasping his dagger with firm and steady hand he struck it repeated blows between the impenetrable scales of his enemy sought with inconceivable address the most tender parts to strike and length succeeded in giving her so deep and so a wound it must needs have worked her up to the most extreme pitch of pain fury for suddenly i beheld him only girdled by a single fold of tail with which in the same manner that one who unexpectedly grasped a nettle throws it away she hurled the wretch into the air far away till i lost him among the bushes as for the snake she hastily regained her former where she lay quiet and concealed for some time before she resumed usual sports though when she did resume them it was evidently less sprightliness than my agony is not to be described nothing was to be seen of unfortunate indian what was become of him had he been killed by violence of the fall or was he at that moment struggling in the of death his preservation i considered as beyond the limits possibility and yet it seemed to me inhuman and ungrateful quite abandon him to his fate without having first exhausted every means of assisting him irresistibly carried away by these i rushed from the balcony and hastened towards the hill by the course which he had pursued himself and which i could easily track the depression of the dewy grass towards that side also had he thrown by the anaconda and it was probable that the thicket shelter me till i could reach the spot where he lay dying in eagerness of this hope i totally overlooked the extreme risk of undertaking the very idea of which but hours would have made me shudder through every limb so true is it violent emotions communicate a force to the mind which enables it rise above itself and gives it courage to encounter danger and death without the shrinking of a single suddenly my attention was arrested by a faint murmur it came from thicket at no great distance i listened again oh heavens it was voice of zadi i lost not a moment in hastening to the place he me he opened his eyelids which seemed already closed in sleep recognized me as i raised him in my arms and a faint stole over his countenance as he stretched out his hand to me he said be thanked that i am able to reward kindness so well even in the grasp i still kept hold of it oh take it take it was the paper which he had purchased so dearly and which faithful creature extended towards it he continued no time before i am deprived of senses again and for ever at least let me have the to know what my master wished me to do alas alas now you will left alone to assist assist him i will doubt it not thou noble i while i strove to raise him from the ground my first must be given to it was in vain that he conjured me to leave him to his fate and think of effecting his rescue without heeding him i to lift him upon my shoulders and tottering beneath his weight endeavoured to effect our escape from the dangerous vicinity of pavilion with difficulty i succeeded in regaining the open fortunately some of the other domestics saw us from the house hastened to relieve me from my wretched burthen assisted by them i length saw zadi safely deposited on a sofa in the he again on the point of losing all sensibility but a cordial powerful virtue being administered without delay his strength restored sufficiently to preserve him from a true none of his limbs were fractured but he was bruised by his fall his breast and ribs had been almost together by the folds of the serpent he was totally to move so much as a finger and his condition was such as would excited pity even in the most insensible nature as for me i sunk beneath this addition to that general calamity which seemed increase with every succeeding moment i was now a single man to hand providence had committed the lives of three afflicted never did mortal pray to heaven with more fervour or more zeal that i did while imploring the divine grace to assist me fulfilling a mission so sacred and so but as for zadi he seemed to have already forgotten himself his dangers and present pains he implored me to waste no more time striving to mitigate his sufferings and assured me that the letter his dear afflicted master would be the best balsam for all his in compliance with his earnest entreaties i prepared to peruse paper but the tears gushed into my eyes on recognizing the handwriting and it was with difficulty that i deciphered the i understand you well my friends my your still more your unremitting and desperate exertions to relieve me all convince me that you are near me that you feel for me that spare no labour to effect my rescue alas you will labour in death has already enveloped me in his dark circle there is no i have already bidden farewell to life i cannot long survive in atmosphere corrupted as it is by the pestilential vapours exhaling from the jaws i die resigned but do not this last and heavy hour by the apprehension lest your exertions in behalf should be the means of involving you in my danger by all is sacred and dear i conjure you abandon me to my unhappy fate oh fly far from hence it is my last my only my most oh everard my poor wife do not abandon my a cold shuddering ran through my bones the poisonous air robbed even of our last wretched hope that the anaconda might at retire wearied out with her vain expectations and leave my friend liberty to quit his retreat but now it was evident from his that long ere this could happen seafield would be no more help must save him or none zadi sobbed aloud it was an addition my own grief to think that i had been obliged to give a fresh pang his faithful bosom and it wrung me to the very soul when i saw give way openly to this burst of sorrow suddenly he uttered a so loud that it startled all who heard he exclaimed in the most violent agitation no shall not bid farewell to life for ever there are still means wretch that i am curses eternal curses on my old head that i did think of it till now and now it comes too late i might have him i might have saved him had i hut thought of it sooner my would have been safe at this moment now it is too late he must and my heedlessness which kills mercy i cried yourself old man you see that messengers are not returned from columbo every moment that we is inestimable if you really do know any means of rescue tell discover it delay not an instant speak to what means do you is too late it is too he repeated one but myself have carried it through and here i lie without the power to move limb and no one else will undertake a task so the i exclaimed again almost frantic with he resumed his words frequently interrupted with anaconda is as i told you formerly the most voracious animal nature she is invincible while stimulated its hunger but she can overcome by a very child as soon as she has satiated herself with then she loses the flexibility of her joints and instead of restless activity she seems plunged iii a benumbing torpor and unable to move overpowered by the burthen of her immoderate dear old said i in rapture at the ray of hope which his words inspired me what you say certain could we satiate this anaconda master were rescued he replied to effect this requires risk of a life and who will venture that oh were but these old as they were two hours ago could i but remove the mountain load weighs upon my chest and prevents my if i am but right in my i interrupted the old man would have driven her prey to the whole herd the whole shouted zadi and he sank exhausted by the violence of his emotions he in a low voice after the pause of a moment thought itself to my recollection long ago but wretch that i was i its execution to be impracticable the plague which lately here among the cattle has occasioned them to be removed from this of the country and they are gone too far to be recalled in time afford the required assistance in despair therefore i banished scheme from my thoughts but now that i am rendered unable to put it execution i i inquired almost breathless with know well van derkel the rich hollander whose estate joins he is the most positive man breathing and having once declared fears of the plague to be groundless he refused out of pure to suffer his cattle to accompany those of his neighbours they on his estate at this moment an herd might easily be procured then but it is too late now it is too late none but his servant would dare said i interrupting him not his faithful looks met mine they burned with new fire while he that on me alone now rested his only hope the flames in his seemed to have communicated themselves to my heart and the with which he loaded me and the effusions of gratitude to heaven to me which he poured forth confirmed the resolution which i already of good comfort said i as i turned to leave him man whom you sought is found i will tread that path which no will tread and i now leave you for the purpose of seeking eyes were now filled with tears of the god of my fathers bless he said raising his eye heaven then i can die contented now then the hour of my deliverance will strike at i lost no time in hastening to van i offered his herdsman whole sum in my possession if he would assist me in driving the under the but he shuddered at the proposal and rejected proffered gold i was not yet discouraged by his authority promised him freedom provided he would but venture so far as advance with the herd to the extremity of the little grove which the north side separated the hill from the open country he again i pressed him and at length he stammered out his consent but a voice so faint and with a look of such irresolution as me that i could place little dependence upon his promised however i at least neglected none of the means which might to our mutual safety i caused the slaves to prepare with all a couple of machines similar to those under which zadi had his hazardous undertaking covered with these we began to drive cattle slowly before us and as the general agitation had caused to be totally neglected b their keepers during their confinement in place which afforded no herbage for their nourishment hunger made more obedient than we should probably have otherwise found them thus did we advance towards the hill though the little resolution my companion evidently grew still less with every step which we forwards to encourage him i bade him observe the tranquillity of anaconda who had gradually withdrawn herself into her green so that we might almost have doubted her being really is the very thing which alarms answered the trembling am sure that she has already discovered and now lurks among the leaves in order that she may make her prey more secure then not one step further will i advance what i have already is enough to merit liberty but at all events i had rather pass rest of my days in fetters than purchase my freedom by advancing single foot beyond this spot and with these words he hurried away however i was the less at his forsaking me when i perceived that without him i could to drive the cattle forwards and that no natural instinct made aware of the neighbourhood of their enemy it was not long before arrived at the i was now obliged to leave the animals their own guidance feeling themselves no longer annoyed by my they gave way to the impulse of hunger and dispersing carelessly began to feed upon the welcome herbage but how great was joy at perceiving the bull separate himself from the rest of the and begin to ascend the hill we arrived near the group of everything was hushed and tranquil not a sound was to be heard the noise of the scattered branches as the bull trampled them his feet the anaconda seemed to have disappeared but on a sudden a loud and rattling rush was heard among the palms with a single spring the snake darted down like a twisted herself with her whole body round her devoted victim the animal was yet aware of his danger he already felt his enclosed between the jaws of the monster and her struck into it deeply roaring aloud he endeavoured to fly succeeded in dragging his tormentor a few yards away with him instantly she coiled herself round him in three or four wide folds drew these knots so close together that the entangled beast incapable of moving and remained as if rooted to the place struggling with the terrors and pangs of death the first noise of extraordinary contest had been sufficient to put the remaining to unequal as was the strife still it was not over instantly the beast wanted not spirit to defend himself nor was his strength exhausted now he rolled himself on the ground and endeavoured crush the enemy with his weight now he swelled every nerve and the power of every muscle to burst the fetters in which his limbs enveloped he shook himself violently he stamped he bit he he pawed up the earth he foamed at the mouth and then dashed on the ground again with convulsive struggles but with every the teeth imprinted on his flesh new wounds with moment she drew her folds tighter and tighter till after for a full quarter of an hour i at length saw the poor stretched out at full length and breathless totally deprived of and of now then i expected to see the anaconda gratify the hunger by which had so long been tormented but i was ignorant that it is not custom of this animal to divide its prey but to swallow it at enormous morsel the size of the murdered bull made this without much preparation and i now learned from the proceedings the necessity which there was for her always remaining the neighbourhood of some large she again seized the bull with her teeth and dragged it to the top the stoutest palm here she endeavoured to place it upright against the trunk having effected this she enveloped the tree and carcase together in one great fold and continued to draw this till she had broken every individual bone in her body into thousand pieces and had virtually reduced it into a shapeless mass flesh she was still occupied in this manner when i hastened back the to rejoice louisa and zadi with the assurance of the roaring of the bull had already prepared the latter for my he limped to meet me at the door in spite of his bodily agonies overpowered me with thanks and benedictions he also informed me the expected succours from columbo were at length arrived and that physician had accompanied them i immediately requested to see latter and commissioned him to impart the good news of approaching deliverance to louisa with such precautions as prevent her enfeebled constitution from suffering through excess joy i also recommended zadi to his care and then hastened back complete my work zadi having assured me that it was necessary to watch for the moment when the anaconda should swallowed her prey and be enervated and overcome by the torpor will be in no want of he added are all ready to accompany you not only because i have succeeded convincing them that all danger is now at an end but because among natives of ceylon the flesh of the anaconda is looked upon as delicious in fact on entering the courtyard i found the whole body of women and children as well as men prepared for the attack with hatchets and every sort of weapon which had offered itself to hands the party from columbo were well provided with ammunition we now all set joyfully forwards for the hill though on it we judged it as well still to use some little i advanced beyond the rest the anaconda had by this time covered the carcase with her slime and was in the very act of this monstrous morsel this task was not accomplished without efforts a full hour elapsed before she had quite finished her meal at length the carcase was entirely swallowed and she herself out at full length in the grass with her stomach distended the most astonishing dimensions every trace of her former and activity had disappeared her immoderate appetite had now her up impotent and defenceless a prey even to the least i hasten to conclude this long and painful tragedy i discharged musket at the monster at a moderate distance this time the ball her close by her eye she felt herself wounded her body swelled spite and venom and every stripe of her variegated skin shone more brilliant and vivid colours but as to revenging herself upon assailant of that she was now totally incapable she made one attempt to regain her old retreat among the boughs of the but sank down again upon the grass motionless and helpless the of my musket was the signal agreed upon to give notice to the crowd that they might approach without danger everyone now towards the snake with loud shouting and clamours of joy we all once attacked her and she soon expired under a thousand blows but did not wait to witness this catastrophe a dearer interest occupied mind i hastened with all speed to the pavilion and knocked loudly the door which was fastened my exclaimed i everard open open bring you life and a minute passed another and still i listened in vain for answer had fatigue overpowered him was he asleep that he not i knocked again i spoke a second time and louder i listened attentively that i could have distinguished the humming of a within the pavilion heaven and earth was it possible that after all had come too late the thought was distraction i snatched an axe one of the slaves and after a few blows the pavilion door flew i rushed into the room and looked eagerly round for my friend i him oh heaven his eyes were closed his cheeks pale every feature his noble countenance so changed that he was scarcely to be he lay extended in his armchair and the noise of our entrance to rouse him from a long stupor he saw me a faint smile played his wan lips while he attempted to stretch out his hand to me but sank down again from weakness i threw my arms round him and him to my heart in an agony of are i endeavoured to say but the attempt to repress gushing tears choked my voice and the sounds were said he with difficulty is being a friend indeed tell me louisa lives and expects i replied come my friend yourself make an effort and shake off this lethargy look upon danger as no more than a frightful dream and awake to the happiness which awaits waits not for he answered faintly have received in this chamber my minutes are counted louisa bear me to louisa the chamber was hot and close even to suffocation we removed him all speed into the open air four of the slaves bearing him as he in his armchair but as we conveyed him down the hill we took care turn his face away from the spot where lay the breathless but horrible anaconda the purer atmosphere seemed immediately to produce beneficial effect upon the sufferer and his strength was still recruited by a few drops of a cordial with which i had taken care provide myself and which i administered with the utmost on our arrival at the we found that attention already provided everything which his master could possibly need bed was prepared every kind of refreshment was in readiness and physician was waiting to afford his assistance but soon found that the most effectual medicine for seafield would be sight of louisa and as the physician was of opinion that the lady more likely to suffer from anxiety to see her husband than from agitation of the interview my friend was indulged in his wish and supported him to the chamber where his wife so anxiously was his i will not attempt to describe this interview nor that afterwards took place between seafield and the faithful zadi feeling heart of itself will fill up this chasm yet i cannot mentioning that it was not till i had explained to my friend the extent of his obligations to that faithful indian and till repeated orders of his master compelled him to appear before him zadi indulged his ardent wish to throw himself at the feet of beloved lord and why then did he deprive himself so long of a which he desired so earnestly the noble fellow was unwilling to his master by showing him how much and how severely he had suffered his sake i cannot tell you how much both the couple myself were affected by this uncommon mark of delicacy oh how happily and how swiftly fled away the first days succeeded the deliverance of my friend alas those first days were only ones destined to pass happily it was soon but too evident sufferings in that fatal pavilion had injured constitution irreparably with every succeeding day his visibly decreased and the blighted flower bowed itself still nearer the ground his malady defied the power of medicine he seemed perish away before our eyes and the physician was at length to acknowledge that all the powers of art were insufficient to any longer exhausted frame not the unsatisfied demands nature not the hunger which gnawed his entrails nor the thirst which dried up his palate not the agonies of his mind and painful wrestling against despair none of these had affected him fatally no it was the pestiferous breath exhaling from the jaws the anaconda which had penetrated into close and prison and whose force concentrated and increased by confinement fallen upon his constitution like a baleful mildew and planted seeds of dissolution in the very marrow of his what louisa and myself endured while watching his slow but progressive journey to the tomb no words can utter he gave zadi his three sons their freedom and made over to him a small estate columbo fully sufficient to secure the comfort of the good old man the remainder of his existence during the last days of his illness frequently reminded me of the letter which he had written in pavilion and of which zadi had obtained possession at such risk this paper he frequently charged me to consider as his testament he as frequently repeated the same thing to his wife she wept by his bedside his last words were like his letter not my poor his last action was to place her hand in mine he sank back a corpse on his pillow and louisa fell lifeless at yet she saw him once more she insisted on pressing her lips once to his i trembled for the convulsive agonies which her delicate would undergo during this last and most painful scene yet was i more alarmed when i witnessed the composure of her affliction held his hand in hers she spoke not one word she heaved not one not a single tear escaped from her burning eyes she stood motionless by his bedside she bent down and pressed her lips upon his closed lids and then slowly and silently she withdrew her widowed i chose for sepulchre the place which he had always best and where he had suffered the most his tomb was raised in fatal pavilion zadi and myself laid our friend in the earth we have thought his coffin profaned had we suffered any other hands touch it seafield and his sufferings slept in the grave his fortunate friends still lived to lament my benefactor had left his property jointly to louisa and myself his wishes respecting us had been expressed too clearly to misunderstood louisa was among the loveliest of her sex but i have counted it profanation had my heart suffered itself to one thought of her less pure than is offered at the shrine of enfranchised saint i loved not louisa no i adored her alas it not long before she became a saint she complained not but she sorrowed she suffered but it was silence in vain did she forbid her lips to confess the progress grief made in her constitution her emaciated form betrayed it a few melancholy weeks had elapsed since the death of friend when one morning her terrified women informed me that she not in her apartment nor apparently had been in bed all night heart instructed me well where to seek the unfortunate i flew to pavilion she was stretched on the marble stone which covered husband in the agony of grief she had burst a blood vessel and limbs were already cold her countenance was calm and a faint seemed to play round her lips it was the only smile which i had there since death she was deposited in the same grave her husband for myself i was unable to sustain the weight of imposed upon me by this second calamity and a long and illness was the consequence of my mental the skill of my physician saved my life and no sooner was i able quit the house than i resolved to withdraw from a land hateful to me by such bitter recollections in consequence of decease the whole of property by his will devolved to me i endeavoured to prevail on zadi to accept some part of it but declared that his liberality had gone beyond his one said he will venture to make my two eldest are grown up and able to take care of themselves but the third young and i feel that my death can be at no great distance brothers may treat him ill or at least may neglect him but to take him into your care let him be your servant and i shall have a wish in this world left unaccomplished under the protection an honest man my boy cannot fail to become an honest man mirza for that was the name the same who is now with me was the room and joined his entreaties to his with earnestness that i could not refuse their request i soon after ceylon followed by blessings the good old man is still and by a third hand i hear from him frequently but the letters he dictates embrace but two topics anxiety for the welfare of his and regret for the loss of his beloved are now continued everard after a addressing himself to the whole society are now informed by means i acquired my fortune it was the gift of gratitude but can i recollect the dreadful service which i rendered seafield alas which i rendered him in vain without feeling my convulsed with horror and my mind tortured by the most recollections it is this which has ever made me unwilling to on the means by which i became possessed of my wealth yet i cannot think it somewhat hard that mere silence should be construed positive guilt and that i should be treated as if convicted of most atrocious crimes because i have not thought it necessary to public my private life and to rend open anew the wounds of my for the gratification of idle and impertinent everard was silent so were all around him confusion blushed on cheek except on whose tender heart had been deeply by the mournful story and whose mild blue eyes still floated in though every now and then a smile beamed through them in approbation her conduct her father at length mustered up his courage broke through this embarrassing dear good said he know not how to excuse my for telling me so many slanders of you nor myself for having credulous enough to believe them in truth there is but one person the room whose lips are worthy to convey to you our apology then let them make and with these words he placed the jessy in and lips wisely expressed the apology in a kiss and acknowledged while he pressed her to his bosom as his bride that apology was not only sufficient but a reward in full for sufferings which he had experienced through the vicissitudes of whole past the the literary dr dick note a tale of adventure should be read as such like a gift horse it be checked too closely a or two however pointing out some of larger howlers not be out of place the anaconda is not found outside south america and its breath is not poisonous the speaks is derived not from ceylon but from the of the west indian slaves from whom family derived wealth even then it owes more to a rendering of it any accurate listening the story as it stands would appear to be clumsy transposition of an earlier version perhaps set attitude to the of ceylon and the acceptance their place as slaves is perhaps typical of his certainly from an hereditary member of parliament serving corrupt tory administration we might expect little else sympathetic sentimental portrait of zadi the figure fits rather than contrasts with the sneering portrayal the other slaves too cowardly to die horribly for the sake their white owner the misogynistic picture of mrs milman is of piece with his racism back to httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr httpaddr
