http://www.arimaa.com/arimaa/challenge/2012 the arimaa humans win screening period mar to mar challenge match apr to apr human tarou asou jean daligault eric momsen with omar syed as computer screening challenge the challenge the first person company or organization develops a program which can defeat the top human arimaa players an official arimaa challenge match before the year will win arimaa challenge prize the prize is currently usd official challenge match will be between the current best and three selected human challenge details the arimaa challenge match will consist of games using the time control each of the players will play a three game series against the program program must demonstrate that it can win at least two of the games against each of the human players to win the challenge program can select which color to play in the first game and remaining games will be played with alternating color all games played according to the arimaa match rules the games will played over the internet in the arimaa gameroom and will be by the public while they are in progress the best program will running on the same computer system as that used in the championship games it will be run under the control of the coordinator with guidance from the match director the director send a representative to be present with the human player during games the director may also use a webcam to monitor the player during the games a representative from the best program also be present with the human player the human player may use aid such as a physical game board or a computer program so pieces can be moved to assist in planning a move no aid may be which suggests a move or provides any information about the aside from the position score defined in the arimaa match rules human player must be isolated from discussions of the game while game is in session between games the human players may study past games the best program may not be manually altered during between the challenge games also it cannot be manually between the computer championship games and the start of challenge match if requested the program can be allowed to run between the games so that it can study the past games and itself as long as this is an automated challenge schedule no more than one game will be played per day any one player the three players will alternate so that one has not played two or more games than another the program team notify the tournament director what color they wish to play in first game before start of the match the selected players must submit their schedule to the tournament director before the start the match the exact schedule specifying the dates times and player for each game will be determined and posted shortly the match hardware and os the hardware and os that will be used in arimaa challenge will be the same as that used in the championship the hardware will typically be a standard purpose computer that can be purchased within usd the os for the arimaa challenge will be a version of the linux selection of the best program the two programs which finished and second in the world computer championship will in a preliminary for the right to play in the arimaa match the two programs will be made available online for humans play against for a duration of at least two weeks and not more four weeks this is referred to as the screening period any player that wants to play against the programs must play programs equally in terms of number of times and color a player must not play more than two times against either program no more than one time with the same color thus if a human plays program a as gold the player must then play program b gold the program which has a better record after the period will go on to play in the challenge match in case of a the program which won the computer championship will go on to in the challenge match the games will be played using time the human players that will be playing in the challenge match not play against the programs during this time also developers the two programs may not play the programs during this time match director may disqualify the games of any player if it that a game was intentionally lost in order to distort selection of the human players omar and aamir syed will three human players that will play in the challenge match the best program the players will be chosen from among the rated arimaa players a first and second backup player will also chosen so that if any of the main players is not able to play any the games the backup players can substitute the name of the players and backup players will be submitted to the match before the start of the computer championship the names of players will be announced publicly after the computer tournament is intent of the challenge the main intent of the arimaa challenge to promote research in ai which can help to advance the field potentially have applications in other areas some areas of ai would be involved depending on the approach taken include recognition machine learning neural networks algorithms and expert systems it is hoped that in the processes achieving the arimaa challenge some new techniques are developed one or more of these areas that can also be applied to problems the arimaa challenge is designed to be met if progress is made in software and not from the advances in which are almost guaranteed as such the challenge will define hardware and os to be used and participants need only to develop advancing the state of the art as mentioned above the intent of arimaa challenge is to help advance research in areas of ai it is recommended that the participants especially those programs in the computer tournament submit articles to the technical journal describing their research and results if program wins the arimaa challenge it must be described in a submitted to the icga technical journal after winning the in order to receive any technical problems technical failures on httpaddr challenge match games will be remediated as once a player has started the next game of the series results of previous games in the series be no matter what issue is if it is determined during a game that either bot or human has suffered a disadvantage the game will be immediately made unrated and resumed from the point at which the first occurred the game must be halted regardless of whether disadvantaged player is winning or if it is determined after a game is over but before the next of the series that either bot or human player suffered a disadvantage the game result will be invalidated game will be made unrated and the game will be replayed from point at which the disadvantage first occurred the game must replayed whether the disadvantaged player won or disadvantages that warrant a game being halted include but are not limited extraneous processes running on the the game server failing to receive a move sent by a bot human either bot or human player not receiving a move sent by game a bot being restarted by the tournament a bot being misconfigured by the tournament the tournament director decides whether technical failures not this list warrant halting replaying when restarting games from a specific position the coordinator will attempt to restore the clock state reserve and game time as closely as possible to the state at the time issue the match coordinator will carry out the match in compliance the stated rules and does not make any decisions that will the course of the match in special situations the coordinator will follow the decision of the match the role of the match director will be to oversee that the challenge match is being conducted according to the stated and to serve as the arbitrator in case of disputes should dispute arise about the outcome of a particular game the will review the logs produced during the game and decide if game should be the director may require any player to have a turned on monitoring during the games also the director may send representative to be present with any player during the all decisions made by the director shall be considered final binding by all omar and aamir syed

http://prize.hutter1.net prize for compressing human widely known as the hutter compress the mb file enwik to less than the current record of the detailed rules for previous more newsgroup on the contest and frequently asked news alexander ratushnyak is the third winner alexander the contest continues prize being able to compress well is closely related to intelligence explained below while intelligence is a slippery concept sizes are hard numbers wikipedia is an extensive snapshot of knowledge if you can compress the first mb of wikipedia than your predecessors your likely has to the intention of this prize is to encourage of intelligent as a path to the create a compressed version archive of the mb enwik of less than about mb more create a linux or windows executable of size s l previous if run it produces without input from other sources a file that is identical to if we can verify your claim you are eligible for a prize minimum claim is restrictions must run in hours on a ghz p with gb ram gb free remark you can download the zipped version enwik here please find more details including constraints relaxations at httpaddr this compression contest is motivated by the fact that being to compress well is closely related to acting intelligently reducing the slippery concept of intelligence to hard file numbers in order to compress data one has to find regularities them which is intrinsically difficult many researchers live analyzing data and finding compact so compressors beating current dumb compressors need to be since the prize to stimulate developing universally smart compressors we need universal corpus of data arguably the online wikipedia is a good snapshot of the human world knowledge so ultimate compressor of it should understand all human knowledge be

a real fund frequently asked questions what is this contest what is artificial what does compression has to do with artificial the contest encourages developing special purpose why lossless why you allow using some fixed default knowledge data why is understanding of the text or intelligence needed achieve maximal why do you focus on what is the ultimate compression of can you prove the claims in the answers to the faq the paq compressors are hard to there are lots of language pieces in the including the decompressor size encourages why do you use the mb enwik and not gb or all why are you limiting validation to less than hours systems with less than gb the total prize is not exactly is mb byte or why do you require windows or linux how can i produce or smaller is artificial general intelligence is razor and hence compression sufficient for i have other questions or am not satisfied with the so far we have received the submissions below each open public comment and verification
